eea50da5-c5ef-4e37-8d9b-db7942c1b7fd	Scotland manager Gordon Strachan felt his players were just short of the accuracy needed to break down a stubborn Georgia defence as his team fell to a 1-0 European Championship qualifying defeat. \n \nScotland started the better side in Tbilisi but struggled to carve clear chances and the hosts improved before Valeri Kazaishvili fired them in front in the 37th minute after no blue-shirted player could close him down quickly enough as he brought down a headed knockback 18 yards out. \n \nShaun Maloney nearly scored direct from a corner and Steven Fletcher hit the post but a foul on the goalkeeper was given the first time and the offside flag went up the second time. \n \nScotland failed to test the home goalkeeper and a succession of crosses and corners came to nothing in the final 15 minutes. \n \nStrachan said: "We didn't do enough to win the game. We definitely didn't do that much wrong to lose the game. \n \n"The game looked like a draw but if you get the first goal life is a lot simpler. We had to play catch-up when we lost the goal. \n \n"Before that, apart from one break, I didn't see any problems in the game. I felt comfortable. I was looking to get to half-time and tell them to up the tempo and think about a couple of things. \n \n"Then they scored and put on a great defensive show and got behind the ball and ready to break. Even then I didn't think there was a problem for us. \n \n"I thought we were a couple of yards away with our passes and intricate moves to try and get through, because we don't have the physical presence to fight them for a goal. \n \n"The lads were brave on the ball but maybe just a wee bit now and then, a foot or two here and there, we couldn't get through and it wasn't to be." \n \nNukri Revishvili's only save came from a deflected Charlie Mulgrew cross but Strachan said: "We can't just throw balls in there, we are not big enough or strong enough. So you have to work our way in there. If you want to do that you have to be precise. That was missing. \n   Promoted stories   \n"You only need one of those balls at somebody's feet and you've got a chance. When we do make a chance it's usually a good one because we are not a scrappy team. We have not got the presence up front to do that." \n \nDespite the game kicking off at 8pm local time, it remained hot and humid in the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena after temperatures hit the mid-30s this week. \n \n"I don't want the players or myself or anyone else to use that as an excuse because it could get lobbed in our faces," Strachan said. "We just have to accept what happened and accept we have to do better the next time with a couple of passes and be more precise." \n \nGeorgia manager Kakhaber Tskhadadze, who replaced Temuri Ketsbaia midway through the campaign, felt his side's second win in Group D was a major step forward but warned they have a tougher task in Dublin on Monday. \n \nTskhadadze, who was applauded into the media room, said: "I'd like to thank everyone for their support and especially the fans. It was a pity there were not more people here but hopefully the crowds come back. \n \n"It was important for our self-belief to win because it's teams of Scotland's quality that will be competing for places in major finals. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"The team were fantastic, especially the defence. Scotland did not really have a clear-cut chance. \n \n"It's no reason to celebrate for long though because we have a more difficult game in three days' time against Ireland and we will be focused on that game in a few hours."

2a804a4e-ddf1-41a6-ad42-816a9c68f8fb	Ray: I have been listening to Tim May talk about the Buckeyes being six-time national champions\never since they defeated Oregon. In your 2015 season preview, the six national championships are\nmentioned again. What gives? \n \nAnyone not just getting to town knows that the Bucks have eight national championship trophies!\nJust because all of them were not “consensus” titles, they were titles nonetheless! \n \nWhat’s Tim’s problem? Maybe he is related to Mark May? \n \n — Pat Stuhldreher, Columbus  \n \n Pat: Here’s what I tell people: You celebrate however many Ohio State titles you like. We\nrecognize six, though “consensus” has nothing to do with it. In fact, two of OSU’s titles (1954 and\n’57) are shared and thus are not consensus at all. Our standard for pre-BCS championships are those\nawarded by a wire service (AP writers or UPI coaches), which excludes 1961 and ’70 — and,\ninterestingly, a lot of other years.  \n \nMr. Stein: I have to take exception to the ranking of “two leaves” for “Fun quotient” in the\nBottom Line (Tuesday). My wife and I had a great time. You didn’t think it was loud? You must have\nbeen sitting indoors. \n \nI have been at a white-out at Penn State, an OSU-Michigan game in the Big House, and the ’Shoe\nfor most of the largest crowds ever. My section of Lane Stadium was just as loud, and Hokies fans\nboisterously cheered their team until the game got out of hand and they had no real quarterback who\ncould stage any sort of comeback. \n \nAll the fans I met (I sat in a Hokies section, and tailgated in a reserved section of the\nparking lot) were friendly and courteous throughout. \n \nI am a Buckeye season-ticket holder and online Dispatch subscriber living in northern Virginia, and I can say that Virginia Tech has a\nbeautiful campus and a fervent fan base. \n \n — Bob Klocek  \n \n Fairfax Station, Va.  \n \n Bob: I don’t disagree about the campus scenery, but I sure didn’t get a sense of fever-pitch\nrowdiness from my press-box seat. The place was no mausoleum, especially in the second quarter, but\nit was a far cry from Madison or State College. It reminded me of OSU’s 1998 game against West\nVirginia in Morgantown, where the home fans expected their team to get thumped, and then were not\nsurprised.  \n \nEditor: I hope the Buckeyes players who were suspended for the first game are proud of\nthemselves — nothing like a selfish act to put your teammates in a bind right from the start. I\nrealize a championship team has to have depth, but that doesn’t give players with scholarships the\nOK to do as they please, knowing that they have someone to pick up their slack. \n \nThese young men are role models to kids who idolize them. So what do they take away from this?\nAre they learning that if they’re an important player, they can do what they please and let someone\nelse cover for their mistakes? \n \n — Terry Culp, Canal Winchester  \n \n Terry: Well, I suspect they’ve learned that they can’t do as they please, because they were\ndenied perhaps the one thing they cherish the most — playing time. That’s not nothing.  \n \nEditor: Nooooo!!! I watched the Wisconsin-Alabama game last Saturday night. Why was the hulking\nvisage of mega-chump Mark May appearing on my screen? \n \nI thought I had read, maybe back in January, that he had rightfully been dumped into the ash can\nof video history. \n \n — Richard Erb  \n \n Clear Brook, Va.  \n \n Richard: May was bounced from ESPN’s College Football Final about the same time Lou Holtz\ndeparted, but the network gave him another, less visible show to continue his shtick of banging on\nOhio State.  \n \nEditor: I am a graduate of Virginia Tech who was invited to the OSU-VT game on Monday by an OSU\nfan. I unfortunately sat in the OSU section. \n \nI have never experienced arrogant, taunting and offensive behavior like I saw Monday. Obviously,\nOSU has the better talent. While many OSU fans were enthusiastic and avid supporters of their team,\nmany others were cussing, booing, laughing at injured players, taking pictures and mocking VT fans\nleaving. Many were loud and abusive. \n \nWe gladly gave up our seats during the first half but saw the same behavior in other sections of\nthe stadium. \n \nYou may have one of the best college football teams in history, but you also have some of the\nmost unsportsmanlike fans I have ever seen. I hope the fan behavior improves as the season\nprogresses. \n \n — Thomas Sherrod  \n \n Statesville, N.C.  \n \n Thomas: Well, there’s always hope, even if for a few people it resides in a different area code\nfrom reality.  \n \nRay: As the NFL kicks off its season, it is absurd that the league will celebrate its 50th Super\nBowl at the end of the year. Did the league not have a championship game during its first 50\nseasons? Well, of course they did. \n \nIt was only called the NFL Championship, which is exactly what the Super Bowl represents. As a\nmatter of fact, the Cleveland Browns have won four championships. Yet they never receive the proper\ncredit because they all occurred prior to the championship game being called the Super Bowl. \n \nDuring the Browns’ first decade in the league, the team played in the championship game seven\ntimes, winning three. Yet not one football talking head mentions these historical feats, only that\nthe Browns are one of four teams that have never played in a Super Bowl. Granted, those\nchampionships were a long, long time ago, but I am old enough to remember the last one, in\n1964. \n \n — Steven H. Spring, South Charleston  \n \n Steven: I remember that last title, too. And I also remember about that time watching Jonny\nQuest and drinking Choc-Ola out of a can. In other words, a lot has changed since Gary Collins was\ncatching passes from Frank Ryan. The truth of the matter is the Super Bowl is the biggest sporting\nevent in the country, and the Browns have never been in it.  \n \nSports editor: As a transplanted Pittsburgher living now in central Ohio, I have been amazed at\nthe large number of Pittsburgh fans here, especially on the East Side. During football season, you\nwould think on Sunday that you were in a Pittsburgh suburb with all the people wearing their\nSteelers gear. \n \nBut The Dispatch ignores this whole section of readers, instead concentrating on the Bengals\nand Browns every day during the season. I can say it is rare that I see anyone wearing Browns gear\nin Columbus! \n \nPlease give the Steelers faithful in Columbus some coverage during the season! \n \n — Tom Thompson, Pickerington  \n \n Tom: Note to self: Stay away from the East Side, especially on Sundays.  \n \n*** \n \n Ray Stein is sports editor of The Dispatch.  \n \n rstein@dispatch.com

19bc3777-94a7-4d86-903c-94504c7420df	Cindy Lehmann was a natural mother \n\nCINDY Lehmann was a natural mother.\n\nIn 26 years of foster caring, she and husband Rob Lehmann welcomed more than 300 children into their home.\n\nTogether they raised six of their biological children and took three of their foster children into permanent care.\n\nBut tragically the 58-year-old Warrnambool woman’s life was cut short when she died after a horrific crash in August.\n\nMrs Lehmann has been described as an incredible woman who provided love and a safe place for children who had been forgotten by the world.\n\nWith a quiet dignity, Mr Lehmann told The Standard how on the night of the accident their son Bo, who lived on Rooneys Road, rang and asked for a ride into work.\n\nMrs Lehmann and her son Joel drove the less than five-minute trip to Bo’s house and headed to the Rooneys Road and Raglan Parade intersection.\n\n“Fortunately Bo and Joel were on the passenger side of the car - Bo was in the middle seat and Joel in the front seat,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\n“She stopped at the lights, she looked up the road to see it was all clear. There were no traffic lights there.\n\n“She looked up and must have thought it was clear. She went across the intersection and the next thing Bo must have turned around and he said ‘truck’ and with that … bang.\n\n“The truck pushed the car and hit her driver’s side. Bo tried to grab the hand brake to stop it from moving or spinning.”\n\nMr Lehmann said 14-year-old Joel bravely ran back to Bo’s house to call for help while Bo, 24, stayed by his mum’s side.\n\n“I got to the intersection and I just saw all the ambulances,” he said.\n\n“They’d gotten her out of the car. I just couldn’t believe it. The car was in a U shape.\n\n“She had severe head injuries and we went to emergency in Warrnambool.\n\n“When I finally saw her, she was in a bad way.”\n\nMrs Lehmann was later airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a critical condition.\n\nMr Lehmann said early CT scans didn’t reveal the extent of her injuries because of swelling.\n\n“She also had fractured ribs, a fractured jaw, a fractured elbow – all things that could get better,” he said.\n\n“The main thing was the trauma to her head. It was just a harrowing week. We were in there talking to her, telling her, ‘wake up, Mum’.”\n\nMr Lehmann was on his way home to Warrnambool to check on his family when he got a call to return to the hospital because the MRI results were back and they weren’t good.\n\n“My heart just dropped,” he said.\n\n“All the thinking there might have been some glimmer of hope.\n\n“We had the big family meeting and they said her whole brain was severely damaged beyond repair and she’d never wake up.\n\n“We all sat down and had to make a big decision.\n\n“She always said to me, ‘if I end up like that, I don’t want to live like that’ - and I’m the same. I don’t want to live relying on a ventilator to keep me alive, but it was a pretty hard decision to make.\n\n“With the vibration she was hit, the whole brain shook and damaged everything in the brain, which she wouldn't wake up from. It’s really hard.”\n\nMrs Lehmann died two days before the couple’s 40th wedding anniversary.\n\nMr and Mrs Lehmann met at a fellowship function and their relationship soon blossomed.\n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Mr Lehmann worked full-time and Mrs Lehmann did family day care. It was from that work Mrs Lehmann saw there were children in need of a loving and secure home.\n\n“She turned around to me one day and said, ‘How about we do foster care?’,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\n“We only had a young family then and the kids were more or less brought up with foster care, but we did talk to them about it. It just snowballed and we’ve been doing it ever since.\n\n“We were a good team and we just felt sorry to see the plight of these kids. More than anything you could just see the way they came to her.\n\n“We just wanted to give them that care that they didn’t have.”\n\nMr Lehmann said although foster care work was challenging, the rewards always outweighed any difficult experiences.\n\n“We’ve had our hard cases - the real demanding cases and some we couldn’t handle,” he said.\n\n“We did everything we possibly we could.\n\n“We’ve had some that left us that have gone on the downward spiral. We’ve had phone calls from some who have gone on to be doctors and just blossomed with their careers and lives. That just made us absolutely happy.”\n\nMrs Lehmann was recognised as carer of the year in the statewide Robert Clark Memorial awards in 2012.\n\nFoster care team leader Marion Noye, from Brophy Family and Youth Services, said Mrs Lehmann had the ability to accept and love all the children who came into her care.\n\nShe said those incredible skills had been passed on by Mr and Mrs Lehmann to their other children.\n\n“You always knew that when you placed a child in the Lehmann house they were going to be safe and happy,” she said.\n\nBrophy chief executive Francis Broekman said Mrs Lehmann was an extraordinary woman who opened her house to children who had often been forgotten and were unable to live at home.\n\n“She offered them love and unconditional support,” he said.\n\n“She and Rob offered their home to children and were able to repair trauma in them.\n\n“They showed them there were people in the world who loved them for who they were.”\n\nMore than 500 people attended Mrs Lehmann’s funeral on September 11 and she was celebrated and remembered as a kind and caring woman who was always doing things for other people.\n\n“It was heartwarming that she was loved by so many but very sad that someone was taken who was so special to me and everybody else,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\nMrs Lehmann also volunteered as a football trainer at Merrivale, Old Collegians and later at Koroit.\n\n“She loved doing that. It was just her break to get away from the family,” Mr Lehmann said.\n\n“She was a wonderful, caring person and she just thought of everybody she was involved with.”\n\nMr Lehmann said he planned to continue the foster care work and he was grateful for the support from family, friends and the community.\n\n“I just want to move on doing exactly what she would like me to do,” he said.\n\n“It’d be nothing to come home at night and see two new faces as I walked in the door and I’d say, ‘Oh Cindy who are these?’ and she’d say, ‘These are so and so. We’ve only got them for a week’.\n\n“Then that week would turn into weeks and months. We’d bring them into our family and bring them up the same way we brought up our kids.\n\n“She was just a natural mother around the home. She was a wonderful mum.”\n\nStory courtesy of The Standard

d2589e20-bd42-4e20-a8c0-9684cda04f30	WASHINGTON (CNN) – President Barack Obama and 2016 presidential candidates paid tribute to legendary baseball player Yogi Berra — a cultural icon and one of the greatest catchers in history — who died Tuesday night at the age of 90. \n\n“Yogi Berra was an American original — a Hall of Famer and humble veteran; prolific jokester and jovial prophet,” Obama said in a statement. “He epitomized what it meant to be a sportsman and a citizen, with a big heart, competitive spirit, and a selfless desire to open baseball to everyone, no matter their background. Michelle and I offer our deepest condolences to his family, his friends, and his fans in New York and across the world.” \n\nSharing one of Berra’s most famous quotes, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton tweeted “‘Baseball is 90% mental—the other half is physical.’ Yogi gave everything at least 140%. We’ll miss him. My prayers are with his family.” \n\nIn light of Pope Francis’ historic trip to the United States, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tweeted an anecdote about Berra and Pope John XXIII. \n\n“When asked if he had an audience with Pope John XXIII, Yogi Berra replied ‘No, but I met with him.’ Am sure they’re meeting again today. RIP,” Bush tweeted. \n\nAnd billionaire real-estate mogul Donald Trump shared a photo of himself with Berra at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, New York on Instagram. \n\n“Yogi Berra was not only a great baseball player, he was a great guy. Yogi will be missed,” Trump wrote.

New York State’s Division of Tourism dubbed I Love NY hosted a special Culinary Harvest ‘Beer Garden’ inside of the luxury of the East 27th Street ballroom, an in-person ode to the change in seasons, earmarked by seasonal dishes and refreshing cold weather inspired spirits. With a sizable open bar on one side and a full-on game of corn hole being played on the other, there was plenty of activity to pique the interests of attendees during the three hour affair. \n \nThough there was plenty to enjoy during the evening- from the food to the drink to the interactive games- the night’s primary focus was the promotion of New York state and the incredible aspects that lay outside of the comforts of city life. The rich history of sporting events, the rural agriculture, the picturesque rolling green mountains and the combination of seemingly endless vineyards and distilleries for touring make New York a far more diverse place than the urban jungle might otherwise have you believe. Despite a multitude of attractive features from Long Island to upstate, in order to keep job growth moving forward and funding progressing, it’s important that the state continue to promote the adventure, the excitement and the pageantry that most of us probably take for granted and are missing out on. \n \nBeating the ninety degree New York City heat, we caught our breath for a moment by grabbing a deliciously thirst quenching pour from Tousey Winery, where their crispy Chardonnay was both versatile and refreshing. With hunger pangs aching, we washed down delicious bites of “Goat Cheese Flan” courtesy of The Gould Hotel , which was a perfect marriage of sweet and savory. Moist and flavorful with a drizzle of honey at the bottom of the plate, Chef Christopher Kuhns also served up an inventive garden-grown green tomato chutney spread over a simple cracker and slice of cheddar, which was just as mouth watering as the flan itself. \n \nBetween savory bites, pours of Defiant Beer – especially their Fall classic “Pumpkin Ale” left us yearning for falling leaves and Halloween scents as we slugged down repeated pours. With each passing beer, guests managed to stop different waitresses with trays of passed around fare from BBQ dishes to New York State Fair style corn dogs. But despite the hankering for fall- it was hard to allow freshly shucked oysters to pass us by. With that in mind, the friendly pairing of Empire Oysters and The Oysterhood doled out ice cold mollusks layered with shaved horseradish and a selection of spice-filled condiments in anticipation of NYC Oyster Week, which rolls through September 27th. \n \nOther highlights included the likes of Chef Robert Borden ‘s pairing of wild American meat and poultry alongside some delicious sushi, fried seaweed and freshly prepared guacamole, Chef Julie Taboulie ‘s (paired up with Empire Beer , both from Syracuse) live demonstration and serving of savory “Salt City Potatoes” and Chef Rich Parente ‘s inventive “Fried Rabbit and Waffles with Red-Eye Gravy,” a deliciously experimental take on the traditional chicken meets waffles comfort dish. Booze-fueled pours from Doc’s Draft Ciders, the Long Island Wine Council and Finger Lakes Hard Cider were pleasantly fulfilling as we awaited some of the event’s more poignant moments. \n \nSpeaking on behalf of the New York State Division of Tourism, Ross Levi put the entirety of the evening in perspective as the assembled crowd continued to indulge in some of the state’s locally produced eats and drinks. 2014 saw visitor spending increase by more than 5%, including the state’s most visited year by overseas travelers in it’s last 14. Moreover, employment increased by more than 20,000 jobs year over year as sporting events like the Belmont Stakes and statewide tourism brought more and more folks to other parts of the state. While the focus- and Wednesday evening’s event for that matter- continues to be in the five boroughs that comprise the New York City area, there is a preponderance of activity outside of our realms- most of which are just a short commute away- that are both eye opening and mouthwatering, given that they continue to flourish right in our very own backyards. \n - Alexandra Fetsey \n  \nFood Highlights from Culinary Harvest “Beer Garden” 2015 \n \n \nThe Gould Hotel – Seneca Falls: “Goat Cheese Flan ” & “Green Tomato Chutney” \n \n \n  \n \nEmpire Oyster – The Adirondacks: “Trout with Granny Smith Apples ” & “Pan Roasted Venison, Petit Fall Squash” \n \n \n  \n \nSachi Asian Bistro \n \n \n  \n \nClocktower Grill – Hudson Valley: “Chicken Fried Rabbit & Waffles with Local Kale Slaw & Red Eye Gravy” \n \n \n\n \nJulie Taboulie – Syracuse: “Stuffed Syracuse Salt Potatoes a la Julie Taboulie Style” \n \n \n\n \nCity to Table:  “Local Cheeses and Charcuterie, Candied Bacon, Rick’s Picks Veggies”  \n \n  \n \nSmokehouse of the Catskills: “Pork and Chicken”
10af65a5-41a3-49e3-964c-8fa98370ee39	Ireland boss Joe Schmidt declared that his side's World Cup starts now after they claimed a convincing bonus-point victory over Romania. \n \nThe 44-10 win at Wembley sees Ireland move to the top of Pool D but their progress to the quarter-finals will depend on tougher tests against both France and, more immediately, Italy next Sunday. \n \nIreland can guarantee qualification to the knock-out stages if they beat the Italians at the Olympic Stadium but it will be important to finish first too, given reigning champions New Zealand could lie in wait for the runners-up. \n \n"Next week is the pivotal week," Schmidt said. \n \n"It's where we can qualify ourselves. The game against France just decides who we play in the quarter-final if we can win next week. \n \n"It's pressure for us and pressure for Italy. That's why people come to a World Cup - they want to see how teams respond to the pressure cooker environment." \n \nSchmidt added: "We know we can qualify if we win next weekend. Italy, after a win and a loss, need to win next weekend to qualify. It becomes a last-16 game for us." \n \nIreland are sweating on the fitness of Rob Kearney for the match after he injured himself scoring the fifth try shortly after coming on as a substitute. \n \n"Rob was involved in a high-speed play after coming on the pitch and just after scoring the try he's jarred himself," Schmidt said. \n \n"We hope it's not too much but the next 24 to 48 hours will tell if he's done anything telling for next week. \n \n"It's through his glute and hip. It happened when his knee hit the ground." \n \nLosing Kearney would be a blow to Ireland but a number of players put their hand up for selection after a dominant performance against Romania. \n \nSchmidt made 12 changes with Italy and France in mind, but his altered line-up showed few signs of weakness, scoring six tries, including four in the second half. \n   Promoted stories   \nTommy Bowe and Keith Earls crossed the line twice each, before Kearney and Chris Henry added two more late on, and Simon Zebo also staked a claim with an impressive display at full-back. \n \n"There were a number of players who performed really well and will create a big of selection headache for Italy," Schmidt said. \n \n"I don't think you're ever totally satisfied. We know we've been imperfect but it's a difficult thing to work through a couple of games where you're heavily favoured." \n \nEarls' second try was his seventh at World Cups, bringing him level with Brian O'Driscoll as Ireland's top-scorer in the tournament's history. \n \n"It's nice for him to be mentioned in the same sentence as Brian O'Driscoll," Schmidt said.  "Because that's the standard that any Irish player in the backline wants to reach." \n \nEarls' milestone came in front of 89,267 fans at Wembley, a record attendance at a Rugby World Cup, beating the 89,019 that watched New Zealand beat Argentina earlier in the tournament. \n \n"It's pretty empowering," Ireland captain Jamie Heaslip said. \n \n"You try block a lot of it out during the game to be composed but their energy bleeds into the squad. \n \n"When you're digging deep and you're blowing hard they do pick you up. The support has blown the squad away to be honest." \n \nRomania managed a consolation try late on through Ovidiu Tonita but they were largely outclassed and head coach Lynn Howells is also targeting the remaining games against Canada, who they play next, and Italy for a victory. \n \n"The first two games against France and Ireland, once we knew the draw, it was about competing and showing everybody we can compete at this level," Howells said. \n \n"I think we've managed that. Now as far as Romania are concerned we're probably playing a semi-final and a final now." \n \nThere was one success for the Romanian squad as scrum-half Florin Surugiu proposed to his girlfriend on the Wembley pitch after the match. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n"I tried to advise him not to but there you go," Howells said. \n \n"She said yes. It's too romantic for me but I'm sure she enjoyed every minute of it."
caf89d24-e2c4-4fe6-bc5c-10230764d5ed	Hidden charges make me see red. I know from sad experience that if you don't check all the small print, you're almost asking to be taken for a ride – but still I get caught out. And I was caught out this summer simply because I had tried to be clever and cut costs. \n    \nThe story centres on spending money on a foreign holiday. The cheapest way to do is to use a prepaid currency card that has no usage charges, no loading fees and no charges when you take money out. \n\nOnce you apply and receive a card, you can simply transfer cash from your current account online – and, if you're really lucky, you can buy currency when the pound is strong ahead of your trip. Do that and you'll be quids in – or euros in – giving you extra holiday cash to spend. \n\nOnce it's arrived you have a card – normally backed by MasterCard – that you can use at most restaurants and shops or even cashpoints abroad. And you won't be facing an unexpected bill when you get home as a result of so-called currency conversion fees or double charging by banks. \n\nWhen I looked into holiday money a couple of years ago, I discovered the exchange rates on most of the cards were also much better than you could get on the high street or at airports. So it made perfect sense to snap up a My Travel Cash card, load it up, and use it to spend abroad on our family holiday that year. \n\nAll went well. It was accepted everywhere we went and I was able to take cash out of overseas ATMs with no worries and no extra charge. The amount we paid – or took out of the cash machine – was the amount taken off the card: simple! When we returned, there was even around €80 still on the card, which I thought would be a good kickstart for our spending next time we went abroad. \n\nAs it happened, that wasn't until this summer. When we talked about holiday money I smugly produced my card and said: "We'll use this. It's already got a fistful of euros on it." But it hadn't. \n\nI had made the cardinal sin of not checking the small print thoroughly and therefore missed the fact that the card has a punitive "inactivity" fee of €2.50 a month. So putting the card away in advance of our next foreign trip – which happened to be 24 months later – ended up costing me around €60. In a stroke that ate up all the potential savings I'd made, both on the holiday back in 2013 and probably every holiday I'll have in the future. Thanks, My Travel Cash! \n\nThe company's website lists 11 free (or "FREE", as it screams the message) services offered by the card before mentioning the expensive inactivity fee. There's no discussion of the vengeful joy of breaking the card into little bits. But I bet they'd charge a fee for that too, if they could. \n\nThere is, of course, a €4 card replacement fee, which hits the hasty.
5bb17a4c-94b9-49bb-815d-2c8c55570bb8	CALGARY - During the four months her foot didn't touch the ground, Hayley Wickenheiser wondered if she'd walk normally again, let alone skate. \n \n\n                            She was able to do both in time to re-join the Canadian women's hockey team for this week's camp in Calgary. \n \n\n                            Canada's all-time leading scorer underwent season-ending surgery in Toronto on Feb. 18 to have a plate and eight screws inserted in her left foot. \n \n\n                            She played in the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, with a broken bone in that foot. Wickenheiser had a screw surgically implanted in it just over a year ago, but pain continued to dog her. \n \n\n                            Of the slings and arrows Wickenheiser has played through in her two decades wearing the Maple Leaf, this one had the potential to end her career. \n \n\n                            So when Wickenheiser's surgeon told her she couldn't put weight on her foot for four months, she obeyed. \n \n\n                            "It was a pretty serious injury to the point where they said if you put any weight on it you could risk long-term damage," Wickenheiser said Tuesday at WinSport's Markin MacPhail Centre. \n \n\n                            "This is the most serious injury I've ever had in my career — a lot of dark days wondering if I'd ever walk normally again. I did everything the surgeon said" \n \n\n                            In the weeks following surgery, Wickenheiser did one-legged windsprints using a scooter and wrapped her cast in a garbage bag so she could swim laps. \n \n\n                            "I had to be very creative in my training and my rehab, but I think I made really good progress in the span of six months to be back here," she said. \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser started skating in July, but she's held off on running and jumping in dryland training. \n \n\n                            "The bone is now fully healed," she said. "If I was a sprinter or a track athlete I wouldn't be back at this point, but because it's hockey I can get away with that lateral push and it doesn't seem to bother me." \n \n\n                            Jayna Hefford's retirement last week at age 38 makes Wickenheiser, 37, the elder stateswoman on the national women's team. \n \n\n                            Of the 47 women invited to training camp, only Wickenheiser and goaltender Charline Labonte are in their 30s. \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser and Hefford are the only two Canadian women to have played in all five Olympic women's hockey tournaments. They won gold in four of them. \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser also played softball for Canada in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Her foot responding the way it has, she was contemplating a seventh Olympic appearance in the 2018 Winter Games. \n \n\n                            "I'd like to play through 2018," Wickenheiser said. "Today, I don't see any reason why I can't. Physically I'm fitter than I've ever been really, considering my foot and the way I was able to come back and feel pretty healthy and good on the ice." \n \n\n                            She intends to play a full season with the Calgary Inferno of the Canadian Women's Hockey League, as well as represent Canada again at November's Four Nations Cup and the 2016 women's world championship in Kamloops, B.C. \n \n\n                            The five-foot-10, 162-pound forward from Shaunavon, Sask., leads Canada all-time in goals (168), assists (207), games played (270) and penalty minutes (312). \n \n\n                            She was captain of the Canadian team that won Olympic gold in 2010 and assistant captain in 2014 in Sochi, but she's now faced with carving a new role for herself. \n \n\n                            Hockey Canada is grooming players such as Marie-Philip Poulin, Rebecca Johnston, Natalie Spooner, Haley Irwin, Lauriane Rougeau and Laura Fortino to be Canada's captains and assistant captains. Where does that leave one of the most decorated women in hockey? \n \n\n                            Women's team general manager Melody Davidson, who coached Wickenheiser in both the 2006 and 2010 Olympics, says making sure Wickenheiser's foot is healthy is the first hurdle upon her return.   \n \n\n                            "Then it's what does she want her role to be, where does she fit it, where do we see her? We've only had her at one camp since Sochi," Davidson said. \n \n\n                            "You can't teach her compete level, her intensity and her willingness to do whatever it takes to win a hockey game and be successful. There's a lot of learnings there for the younger players to observe and see. A lot of them have never played with her or never even been to a camp with her." \n \n\n                            Wickenheiser accepts the leadership torch has been passed to the 20-somethings. \n \n\n                            "I've been around for a long time, played on the team for a long time," she said. "My voice has been around for a long time, so I think it's nice to have a fresh, new look going forward. \n \n\n                            "Others have to step up and carry some of that load now and that's a nice thing. I still do the same things I've always done and led by example, play hard and train hard and all those things." \n \n\n                            The Canadian women play a series of exhibition games against Alberta Midget Hockey League teams starting Thursday. Their camp concludes Sunday. \n \n\n                            By Donna Spencer, The Canadian Press
18e18bca-7313-41d9-b636-827cce77433e	Stormy skies can be restful \n \nWarnings for : musings ( 1 ), mentions of vigorous exercise, and substitute swear words (“Cuss Lite”(TM) \n \nI have given up swearing for autumn, and taking up running til at least early December. It remains to seen which one proves more chuffin’ difficult. \n \nI’ve probably whinged before – and undoubtedly, unless WordPress shuts me down, or the world ends, will again – about the fact that new immigrants to the UK do not receive a handbook on arrival. Nor did the “Life in the UK” test cover such useful subjects as food, old telly shows, or swearing. \n \n“Life in the UK” did ( 2 ) include a section on sport, though it was comparatively brief compared to such useful bits of information as, “What percentage of the Welsh population are from ethnic minorities?” According to my husband, who’s a Yorkshireman, and helped me study, the real answer is, “All of them: they’re Welsh.” \n \nThe citizenship exams are probably on my mind because a Polish lady we know has just sat her English exam, and is sitting her “Life” exam next. The subjects of immigration, refugees, and the like are also in the news and, judging from my own life, a heated topic of conversation. \n \nIt’s also nearly five years since I officially became a British subject. I say “officially” because both practically and emotionally, I already thought of myself as Anglo-American. On a practical level, I had worked, paid taxes – including National Insurance (NI) – and did my best to follow laws and rules such as putting my bins out on the correct day. I’d also become involved in local causes, politics, and charities, as well as given money, and, quite literally, blood. \n \nWhich brings me to my latest charitable venture, and the Shoes of Extreme Pinkness: \n \nSee? \n \nSo far, the shoes and several pairs of socks are the only kit which I’ve purchased for the fund raiser I’m running on Sunday 6 December: the 10k “Percy Pud” race in Sheffield . \n \nI do have one other bit of kit which I have been wearing whilst training: a t-shirt given to me by one of the two charities I’ll be raising funds for, Combat Stress . The other charity is also a mental health one, and is specifically round a project(s) aimed at helping people in my adopted home town of Doncaster. \n \nBecause, whilst I’ll always be American – and tick the “ White, Other ” box on forms – I consider myself to be not only British in law, but by choice, and heart. \n \nBecause, in part, I was allowed to make that choice. I was and am white, speak English , and am not – directly, at least ( 3 ) – perceived as belonging to a “scary” category of immigrant. \n \nNext time someone asks “But why don’t the such-and-such – fill in the blank with the ethnic and/or religious group of your choice – assimilate?” – ask yourselves: are we honestly giving people a real choice to join in? \n \nSwans on still waters: Doncaster, 2015 \n \n( 1 ) This blog is subtitled “Musings of a British Eccentric”, so it’s on the tin \n( 2 ) As of Spring 2010 \n( 3 ) I am half-Romanian on my dad’s side

c84322c1-aa3b-4429-99d0-12cb3413804b	This has been a disaster of a legislative session for transparency. Earlier this week we noted the turkey that would prevent cities from shedding light on union negotiations, or even getting an independent financial analysis of them. Here's another bad bill on Gov. Jerry Brown's desk: AB 1544, which would do away with the state-mandated reporting of government payments made at the behest of an elected official, a rule that makes it easy to track political influence in obtaining government money for private companies or individuals.\n\nOf the 120 members of the Assembly and Senate, 112 voted for it. But Brown gets the final say with his veto. He should listen to Jodi Remke, whom he appointed last year to chair the state Fair Political Practices Commission.\n\n"This bill would roll back current law and lessen transparency," Remke wrote the governor last week. "Elected officials would no longer need to disclose when they request or solicit government money on behalf of others -- even when those government funds are being given to for-profit corporations and private individuals and organizations."\n\nThe FPPC says elected state officials this year alone have reported more than $15 million in requests to government agencies. Millions have gone to private companies.\n\nTo understand why this matters, consider the biggest example this year: Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, asked the California Energy Commission to award a $3.4 million grant to Viridis Fuels of Oakland.In April, the energy commission approved the grant, to build a plant that will manufacture up to 20 million gallons per year of biodiesel fuel and 4 million gallons of technical-grade glycerin.\n\nThen, on June 6, Viridis CEO Kathy Neal contributed $1,000 to Bonta's re-election campaign, and her ex-husband, Elihu Harris, former assemblyman and former mayor of Oakland who is listed as chairman of Viridis' advisers, contributed $250. The company's president, Mario Juarez, had already contributed $500 to Bonta.\n\nThis is the sort of money trail that the state's Political Reform Act aims to expose -- and the Legislature now wants to hide. Under AB 1544, Bonta would not have been required to report his requests on Viridis' behalf, so the gifts from Neal and others wouldn't have raised eyebrows.\n\nAs Remke wrote, "This disclosure is vital because it helps to identify actual or perceived influence individuals may have over elected officials."\n\nThe Political Reform Act was written at Brown's instigation when he was secretary of state and approved by voters in 1974. It can be changed with approval by the governor and two-thirds of the Legislature.\n\nReporting of so-called behested payments was not required in the original act. The Legislature wisely added them in 1997. Now, it wants to narrow the scope so elected officials don't have to report government payouts made at their urging.\n\nIf members had nothing to hide, they wouldn't have a problem with the law. That's why it has to stay as it is. The governor needs to stop it.
37149bd8-6033-494d-aefe-b55312a71dc4	LONDON , Sept. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Hortonworks, Inc. (NASDAQ: HDP ), the leader in Open Enterprise Hadoop, today announced it has expanded its European customer base with the addition of Open Energi, a company harnessing flexibility in demand for energy. Open Energi has selected the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP™) to transform the way energy is delivered and consumed through smart grids with Hadoop-powered, real-time, Internet of Things (IoT) data. \n \nSmart grids, powered by sensor data, allow energy consumption to be managed in real-time based on immediate demand and supply data rather than historic patterns of energy use. With HDP, the industry’s only Open Enterprise Hadoop solution, Open Energi will help organisations gain valuable insights by analysing real-time information based on data streamed from over 3,000 electricity consuming assets and meters around the United Kingdom . \n \nHortonworks and Open Energi: Building the Virtual Power Station \n \nOpen Energi’s patented demand response technology is helping to drive momentum behind smart grids by enabling organisations – including the likes of Sainsbury’s, United Utilities and Aggregate Industries – to turn energy-intensive equipment such as fridges, pumps and fans into “smart devices” which can alter their energy use intelligently in response to fluctuations in electricity supply and demand nationwide. Its unique Dynamic Demand technology aggregates consumption across its customers’ sites to provide a fast, flexible solution equivalent to a power station, only instead of adjusting supply up or down, it adjusts demand to meet supply. \n \nUsing HDP, Open Energi will collect, store and analyse sensor data containing information about real-time electricity consumption and control processes more efficiently and at a far greater scale than previously possible. Additionally, HDP will provide a single view of all this information to enable organisations to react swiftly to changing conditions on the grid, and identify ways to generate extra revenue from existing assets, maximise energy savings and spot opportunities to reduce CO 2 emissions. \n \n“Our vision is to build the world’s first virtual power station and we aim to do that by developing a smarter platform built around smarter demand,” explained David Hill , Business Development Director, Open Energi . “Using the HDP in combination with the IoT will enable us to make connections between a wider range of disparate datasets at a far greater scale, so that we can provide organisations with a previously unattainable level of insight into their use of energy and ultimately create an energy system which is cleaner, cheaper and more secure.” \n \nHadoop and the Internet of Things: Better together \n \nAs more devices connect to the IoT, an ever-increasing amount of data is being created that can offer valuable insight into a number of areas. In addition to supporting the optimisation of smart grids, Open Enterprise Hadoop’s ability to accommodate over 1 trillion files through an internet-scale storage layer can be used to track everything from weather patterns to supporting the healthcare industry to more effectively record and monitor patients’ vital statistics and other health indicators.  \n \n“Data is the driving force behind a smarter energy grid and with access to more accurate technology, it is now possible to build a far more detailed picture of energy usage,” said Andy Leaver , Vice President of International Operations, Hortonworks. “Through its use of the Hortonworks Data Platform, Open Energi will have real-time information and insight into grid conditions that can be fed back to customers help them make more informed decisions about their energy consumption. This collaboration is a great example of Hortonworks’ momentum internationally as more customers in more industries turn to Hortonworks to solve their big data problems.” \n \nAdditional Resources \n \nHortonworks DataFlow:                     http://hortonworks.com/products/dataflow/ \n \nHortonworks to Acquire Onyara:        http://hortonworks.com/blog/hortonworks-acquires-onyara/ \n \nHortonworks Customers:                  http://hortonworks.com/customers/ \n \nAbout Hortonworks \n \nHortonworks is the leader in accelerating business transformations with Open Enterprise Hadoop by developing, distributing and supporting an enterprise-scale data platform built entirely on open source technology including Apache™ Hadoop®.

Solutions such as this, coupled with on-site generation and energy storage technologies means that the energy market is no longer a linear value chain driven by fossil fuel production but is becoming bi-directional; creating a new energy economy where energy consumers can both take and provide service back to the grid and generate revenue. \n \nMedia Contact:  \nMichelle Lazzar \n408-828-9681 \ncomms@hortonworks.com \n \nLogo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140227/SF73721LOGO   \n \n  \n \nSource: PrNewsWire All \n Hortonworks and Open Energi to Deliver Smarter Energy Grid
85adf986-0acf-4616-af5d-669aa50e89eb	Fairfield City Schools will break ground on its new buildings next month, about five months earlier than planned. \n\nIn a special meeting this morning, the board of education approved three amendments that will allow construction manager Skanska-Megan to begin the site work on all three buildings as early as next month, officials said. \n\nThe buildings are still scheduled to open for the 2017-18 school year, but by starting early, the district hopes to save some money, according to Treasurer Nancy Lane. Because the work has not been contracted out yet, Lane said she didn’t know exactly how much the savings would be. \n\nThe district is building a new Central Elementary, a new freshman school, and a new yet-to-be-named elementary school building. Voters approved the $80 million project after passing a $61 million bond issue last year; the state will contribute the other $19 million. The site work is expected to cost $4 million. \n\n“This is starting the dirt work while we’ve got a couple of good months of weather before winter,” said Peter Becker, project executive for Skanska-Megan. “Everything’s still on track … if you do it in the spring and you’ve got a wet spring, you’re behind the eight-ball for being ready to start the structure.” \n\nThe early site work involves getting the dirt to the proper levels for construction. The actual construction is not expected to be until the spring, but the groundbreaking ceremony will be held sometime in mid-October, he said. \n\n“Right now, what the district is doing is saving money, because you don’t have to spend a lot of money drying dirt in the spring,” Becker said. \n\nBoard member Dan Hare suggested regular community updates on the project, noting there was confusion about the district’s renovated stadium, which fell behind schedule, requiring the district to move its first home game to Lakota East High School.

fa529766-124a-47dd-9d56-2f314a26dbdd	My poor Erik, has been getting the brunt of my attention the past couple of months.\nAside from the sleeping issues (resolved hopefully), he also struggles with homework.  This has been an issue from the first day he walked into school (pre-k).  Erik is smart but writing has always been a major struggle for him.   When asked to write, anything, he panics and throws a tantrum.\nI had dealt with this in the past by carving out one-on-one time each weekend to help him through it in one day so we didn't have to struggle through it during the week.  This year, that's not possible, which actually is probably a blessing because it's forcing me to address the real issue.\nI've wondered in the past whether or not his writing reluctance was behavioral or a learning issue.\nThis year though, I'm pretty sure it is a learning issue.\nErik never fusses about any homework that doesn't involve writing - spelling city, the math website, reading.  His reluctance is only related to writing.\nWhen I ask him what the issue you he says, " I have the answer in my head mom, like my head is a paper, but I can't get it out."\nHe is a fairly quiet kid, who has never played pretend, told stories, etc.  Basically his expressive language seems to be somewhat delayed.  He's been in counseling, due to the sleep and marriage issues, and his counselor has mentioned to me that he is very slow to answer her questions (has to think before he speaks for quite sometime and seems unable to express how he is feeling aside from being "fine).   He also struggles with tying his shoes and can not tell left from right.\nHis kindergarten teacher mentioned in two report cards that he was slow to finish his work, seemed distractable.   I spoke with his first grade teacher briefly this week, and she said she had also noticed this last year, primarily in math where he could tell her the answer but really struggled to show his work.\nI have told his second grade teacher about our struggles with writing homework and she spoke with the school psychologist who gave her some ideas to try and identify what is the main issue.\nThis writing issue has never been a true issue at school though because academically erik is ahead of his grade level - so he hasn't had to worry about the actual work, and has been able to focus solely on writing the answers.   As the school work becomes harder, I am really concerned that he will fall behind as he won't immediately know the answers anymore and will have to actually work on the answers PLUS the writing.  Yikes!\nSo here is what we are doing so far....\n1) Mom gave me some very good ideas regarding homework.  She suggested with the reading response homework that instead of using a book he has read that week (his reading is very advanced) he use a book more appropriate to a second grader (Gingerbread Man style book).  This level of book will make figuring out the answers much easier, so he doesn't have to struggle through finding the answer and the writing.\nMom knows Erik and wasn't surprised he was struggling with writing as she has noted his limited expressive language in the past.  She explained that in order to show your work/write, you have to get an idea from your head to paper, which is a more advanced skill than getting your answer from your head to your mouth.   Erik struggles to get the answer from his head to his mouth; so it's no surprise the more advance step (head to paper) has been a big struggle for him.  This week I had him dictate the answers to me, I wrote them out, and he copied them.  I did the same for him in math and it went SO much better!!!  I am going to do this for a number of weeks.  Then, if it continues to go well, I am going to try to have him look at my written work for a little bit, but then see if he can write the answer on his own.\n2) His counselor, who is a elementary school counselor and a licensed pediatric therapist, is going to work through some material she uses for her autistic kids on helping them express their emotions. (Erik isn't autistic, but struggles with some of the same communication skills.)\n3) His teacher is aware and watching him for this, early assessments have been put in place. I feel much better about everything now than I did two weeks ago, because at least we have some things in place to help my little buddy.\nThe ability to communicate (emotions) is something Victor has always struggled with and was a big part of why our marriage has struggled/failed.  I feel an intense need to equip Erik with these skills as he also really struggles with that.\nPlease keep my sweet boy in your prayers!
b8cda84d-cf9b-40ef-8aae-a74eefe5ba5f	Google’s September 29th event announced this morning is rumoured to be where we’ll see the first sight of the new Chromecast, but more importantly new Nexus phones. The rumour this year is that we’ll see two Neuxs phones with one built by LG and a larger model built by Huawei, and now there seems to be names for them. \n \nThe LG built Nexus, known internally at Google by the fishy name ‘Bullhead’, will be called the Nexus 5X according to a rumour from Android Authority a couple of weeks back which also rumoured the price to begin at US$400. Overnight the guys at DroidLife have apparently received confirmation from a source of theirs that the Nexus 6 2015 , known internally at Google by it’s fish codename of ‘Angler’, will be called the Nexus 6P . \n \nNexus 5X \n\n \nSpec wise, the LG built Nexus 5X will have a 5.2″ screen, though rumours about resolution are split between 1080P and QHD (2560×1440). A Snapdragon 808 is very heavily rumoured to be under the hood with 3GB of RAM with either 16GB or 32GB of storage and powered by a 2700mAh battery. \n \nThe rear of the phone shown in leaks to date have shown a protruding camera bump which will house a 12.3MP camera which may include Optical Image Stabilisation and from the looks of it, laser auto-focus is included as well next to an LED Flash. \n \nColour wise, the phone look set to come in the traditional ‘Panda’ colour options of Black (or possibly a Dark Blue) and White, but a recent leak pointed towards a mint colour option as well, though that could just be a prototype with Google playing around with colour variants. \n \nNexus 6P \n\n                   \nGoogle’s big (hah) hope this year is the larger screened Nexus 6P built by partner Huawei – currently the number 1 manufacturer of mobile phones in China and number 3 manufacturer in the world. The Huawei Nexus partnership is an important one for Google with hopes that the Huawei Nexus will be a bridge for the company into the potentially highly lucrative Chinese market. \n \nThe larger screened Nexus 6P with its 5.7″ QHD (2560×1440) resolution display is set to be a more premium option with a rumoured metal body construction along the lines of their recent  P8 and Mate S launches which have shown the manufacturing prowess of the company to build a solid piece of hardware. \n \nUnder that metal body hood is rumoured to be a Snapdragon 810 (V2.1) processor with cores clocked at 1.9GHz and 3GB of RAM. Storage options range from 32-128GB on this option according to some rumours, finally ending the 16GB option. A massive battery over 3,000mAh is expected to power the Nexus 6P which when paired with new power saving features such as Doze in Android Marshmallow, could mean great battery life. \n \nRumours for the camera point to a camera similar to that of the Nexus 5X, with a 12.3MP camera with OIS and laser auto-focus. As you can see from the leaked photo above, the phone has a unique camera bump on the rear. \n \nNexus \nBeing a dual release, the Nexus phones will both feature a fingerprint scanner, a feature backed up by both leaks of the phones and the announcement of fingerprint support in Android Marshmallow that the Nexus phones are built as reference devices for. Also, though not shown as yet in anything other than renders, the phones will both have a USB-C connector on the bottom of the phone, something that Google advised during I/O this year. \n \nThe naming and specs aren’t for certain until that September 29th event rolls around, but it seems pretty solid.
dd83964f-25d0-4703-a3a9-0699a94f2808	Tsabong — The Apostolic Faith Mission church men's fellowship member for Tsabong branch, Atamelang Mmereki, says sports fellowship builts strong families, associations and general society whose moral is slowly decaying. Tsabong Apostolic Faith Mission church sports fellowship was formed in 2010 and has been used as a forum where the spirit of botho, could be instilled among the youth.\n\nThe primary purpose of the sports club according Mmereki is to teach married men the mannerism that could build strong homes.\n\nHe said the club also kept those actively involved mentally and physically sharp at all times.\n\n"Fitness in the church and the general public is an important element that cannot be ignored."\n\nHe said the church would continue on its mission to lure as many people as possible to the club. Mmereki expressed happiness saying positive outcomes were slowly coming to the fore as the club continued to attract scores of young men to the church.
259ae48d-0428-4f8d-a451-0684e28429d8	GMC Sports Information \n  \nThe Georgia Military College Bulldogs fell to visiting College of DuPage at home on Saturday. \n \nIt was all DuPage to start out the game as they held Georgia Military College (GMC) to a 3-and-out and scored on their following drive on a 5-yard touchdown with 10:50 left in the first quarter to put DuPage on the board first 7-0. \n \nIt was more of the same as DuPage held GMC to another 3-and-out and scored on another rushing touchdown, this time for 56 yards to put them up 14-0. \n \nAfter a couple of stalled out drives for both teams, DuPage scored once again on another rush touchdown increasing the number to a 79-yard touchdown, putting them up 21-0. \n \nGMC finally got on the board with a field goal from Evan Pantels to put the score at 21-3. \n \nThe following drive DuPage converted for another rushing touchdown from 4 yards out after a big return to set up the score. \n \nAfter an interception thrown by GMC, DuPage scored on field goal and increased their lead to 31-3. \n \nTo start the second half GMC came out strong on defense holding DuPage to no points, but on the Bulldogs’ following offensive drive they threw an interception returned for a touchdown, putting the score at 39-3 after the 2-point conversion. \n \nGMC kept fighting as David Mims intercepted the DuPage pass with 1:13 left in the third quarter. \n \nThe Bulldogs closed the game out strong, playing good defense and stalling out a few DuPage drives, forcing a safety on a punt followed by a TD by Josh Nurse. \n \nDuPage ended the game with an interception and win with a final score of 39-12 in the opponent’s favor. \n \nGMC head coach Bert Williams had a few thoughts after the game. \n \n“It was certainly a disappointing day for us all. We would have loved to pick up a win, but we ran into a very good program in DuPage College. Not taking anything away from them, but we were a bit dead-legged with the short preparation week. We will now have an open week were we can get rested, regroup and work on our areas that need improvement. We trust that our young guys will take some lessons away from this and get better. There is a lot of football left and we will be ready to go on Oct. 3 when we line it up against a very good program in Nassau Community College (N.Y.).”
7351f501-5b1f-4c2e-8093-efe3a98d5b8f	It’s better to burn out than fade away as old Neil Young observed from the safety of his thirties… yet how would you feel if you’d done both? Sixty years after her silent flame flickered so brightly did Louise Brooks spend her days in doubt and remorse?\nAs with politicians, actors’ careers often end in failure – a life measured by success, commercial and critical popularity, appreciation of your talent and your looks (although I think we’ve all got to contend with that…). Few had the visceral, visual impact of Louise Brooks nor the unique combination of intellect and beauty than enabled her to transcended the self-made mess of her Hollywood years to become an icon; her posters and postcards the gateway experience to a face that still compels attention and repeated viewing.\nAny excuse... Leslie Mildiner’s new play American Venus takes the title of one of Brooks’ (mostly) lost films to tell the tale of her life as she lives out her final days in the bedroom of her Rochester apartment.\nMildiner bravely takes on the task of recreating one of the most complex personalities in film and succeeds in presenting a version of Brooksie that rings true not just from a fans’ point of view but on a human level.\nThis is in large part down to a titanic performance of wit and integrity from Susan Penhaligon who fights against the dying of the light in her own way: denying her usefulness and importance, putting down her carers and long-suffering friends as she is slowly weakened by a combination of emphysema and a heart condition.\nSusan Penhaligon Penhaligon’s delivery is pitch perfect and out of every excruciating coughing fit she flies with stinging one-liners striking out at herself and those around her.\nShe has dreams of her past and relives the brief affair her younger self, played by the sparkling Angharad George-Carey with elfin energy, had with Charlie Chaplin in 1925 New York. Brooks was 18 at the time and a dancer in the Follies just about to embark on a movie contract with Warner Brothers. There’s no evidence that she thought Chaplin was “The One” but in the play their relationship is used to show the intensity of Louise’s character – her near limitless possibilities the near-equal of Chaplin’s own…\nAngharad George-Carey poses as young Louise Tim Walton (who I’d last seen in the excellent City of Angels at the Donmar) plays Chaplin as a charismatic, muscular intellectual who is fascinated by the young woman’s refusal to submit to his will. Chaplin has just become a father again but Louise is unimpressed, she is a self-sufficient unit who will make her own mistakes with no room for phony sentimentality.\nMildiner appears to suggest that a combination of harsh parenting and her sexual abuse aged nine, may have made Brooks the unyielding truth-sayer and performer she was – who knows? She certainly seemed capable of inspiring loyalty and was supported by financial contributions by an ex-lover for the last few decades of her life.\nMary Keegan Here she is cared for by Phylis (Mary Keegan who is also superb) who is stronger than anyone suspects, ignoring Louise’s art of misdirection and trying to do the best for her. One hopes that Brooksie did indeed have such a steadfast supporter.\nLouise rides Phylis hard but this seems to be part delusion and part thank you… Phylis’ husband Frank (Brian Deacon) is not as strong as the women and whilst he makes himself busy Louise always has something more for him to do.\nSusan Penhaligon and Nicholas Waring in rehearsal Louis has a friend Stan (Nicholas Waring) who collects her library books and brightens her day with his tales of romantic failure. He leads with his heart, something Brooksie would never do, and as a consequence is constantly disappointed by the men in his life. His latest lover is clearly only after his money and a green card… he leaves him in the end for a woman. Poor Stan, if only he had a tenth of Louise’s spirit.\nAnother visitor is the librarian Tara (Sophia Swannell) who arrives initially to complain about Louise’s annotating the books she borrows with corrections and other “helpful” observations (including one concerning Tyrone Power that I probably shouldn’t repeat in writing). She stands her ground and is accepted.\nSophia Swannell and Brian Deacon Louise is invited to be guest of honour at a retrospective screening of six films at Eastman House and has to be cajoled into going by Stan, she weeps at the sight of herself in Pandora’s Box… like being “present at her own autopsy…”\nDirected by Sarah Berger who makes splendid use of the limited space of Fred’s Place this was close-contact theatre with every emphysematic fit making the audience squirm. I have no idea how the performers can stay so focused mere feet away from their audience but if you want to see how actors really work this is the place to be.\nAngharad George-Carey and Tim Walton rehearse napping Louise’s passing was felt most pertinently by Phylis – I won’t give away exactly how – but her message of obstinacy in the face of incapacity is a call to all to be true to themselves and to treat the twin imposters of fame and failure just the same.\nDon’t waste it… and I’m pretty sure, Brooks, for all her trials, never really did. There are no doubts from Louise who’s only regret was growing old and hating it: if all you wanted to do was dance why love life when you can’t do what you love anymore?\nAmerican Venus is part of the Ever Hopefull Repertory Season of plays which completes at Fred's Place today… it deserves a wider audience and hopefully will get another airing. There's a short video about the season here.\n6 Frederick's Place, just round the corner from Bank station Keep an eye out for further events at No. 6, Fred’s Place and from the So and So Arts Club. It's the most intimate of venues in a side-street Georgian townhouse where Disreali lived in the 1820's and we almost felt like intruders as west end tales were passed around the room... a real treat!

9e74613b-5d0f-479b-b981-c32f6e6a0f0f	James Ernette encouraged family members to get involved in the printing business he founded, and he mentored them along the way. \n\nAfter retiring, he helped his daughter, the company's new president, become certified through the Women's Business Enterprise National Council. \n\n“The paperwork had to be a foot high. We did it together,” said Lisa R. Frederick, president of Unity Printing Co. Inc. near Latrobe. \n\nJames L. “Jay” Ernette of Greensburg, Hutchinson Island, Fla., and Port St. Lucie, Fla., died unexpectedly Monday, Aug. 31, 2015, in Excela Health Latrobe Hospital. He was 70. \n\nHe was born July 18, 1945, in Greensburg, a son of the late William C. Ernette Sr. and Dorothy R. (Longsdorf) Ernette. \n\nHe graduated from Hempfield Area High School, Point Park College and the Pennsylvania State Police Academy. \n\nMr. Ernette was a state trooper for 20 years. After retiring, he continued to work in the printing business, “teaching by explaining,” said his son-in-law and company COO, Joe Frederick. \n\nMr. Ernette “stepped right in” when Frederick's father died to support him and his younger brother, he said. \n\nMr. Ernette was a member and officer of numerous Masonic organizations. In 1998, he was elected to serve a term as Right Worshipful Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. \n\nA highlight of his swearing-in ceremony included the use of a Bible once owned by Mason and Founding Father George Washington, his daughter said. \n\nShe recalled his determination to bring the Masonic Village at Sewickley to fruition. \n\n“He really wanted Western Pennsylvania to have an option,” she said. \n\nAn avid Steelers fan and season-ticket holder, Mr. Ernette saw promise in a team ball boy he got to know. The former tailor provided the young man with a suit and drove him to a successful West Point Military Academy interview. \n\nIn a recent letter, the young man thanked him for his “care and guidance.” \n\nHe is survived by his wife of 46 years, Brenda Smith Ernette; daughter, Lisa R.

f3552212-8dbe-4f29-9415-76d800052a84	Here comes the much-awaited month in the fashion magazine business: September. It's the month where every publishers around the globe brought the best in fashion for Fall/Winter collection. This year, the tradition is continued as far as the 'real estate' of the magazine is concerned - by which, what I meant is its thickness. I don't need to explain it anymore coz it's known that September issues always had that hefty weight they're carrying. If you don't get those biceps toned up while bringing those mags in your arms, then don't call it September issues! Unlike the previous years where I always joined the fashion bandwagon by getting myself a bulk of those September mags, in 2015 I somehow reduces the added weights by choosing just a couple of printed versions. Not only to save budget (which is probably the big reason during this economic downturn!), but also to save some spaces in my home library... coz apparently I'm having some issues for storing my reading materials. See, September issues, storage issue. The safe bet: going digital. And the best bet: free digital versions! These are some of the digital version I'm adding into my list for this year's September issues: Men's Health UK. For some reason this year, most upscale bookstore that I went to like Kinokuniya, Times Bookstore and Borders no longer carry this mag. I dunno what's the reason, but IMO Men's Health UK is the best Men's Health mag among all of its global franchise in existence. For this month, they went for Mr. Superman - Henry Cavill - to front the magazine. The fashion editorial to look for is the 'Green is Good' section, where they featured a selection of green-inspired thematic pieces in forest green, emerald, pea green and olive, from the jacket to accessories like bag and shoes, to even the gadget like headphones, bearing the color. Men's Health US, with Colin Farrell as the cover guy. As Fall fashion is concerned, the editorial spread to look for is the 'camping in the wood' theme - bearing the laid-back casual pieces that brought the lumberjack feel into a new level (nope, I'm not referring to that lumbersexual thing!) GQ US. I have one statement to say about this issue: HATE IT. There's nothing in this issue is inspiring. Fashion is very blah - I mean, totally lower than mediocre - and the choice of cover guy is totally wrong! Even if they're putting Joe Manganiello in one of the editorial spread, I can't comprehend the choice of fashion pieces they've selected. All wrong for a coveted issue. Eeek! Details. This issue could be a collector's item - that's why I had the print version as well. The front cover is what a front cover of a fashion mag should be - fronted by the male models. Not one, not two, but 31 male models du jour.  Either veteran models who made it in the industry for years, to the rising star to watch, this is definitely a great cover. Rivals that 2014 Vogue! GQ Australia. Honestly, I never took sight to this friend Down Under, but it seems that they're doing way better than its sibling out there in the States. Jam-packed with fashion pieces from the clothes to watches and bags galore, and not to mention the overflowing editorial spread - definitely, this is what GQ mag should be! (and a GQ September issue should be!) Oh, September issues are definitely for the ladies - hands down. I'll be taking some time to check those in the women's fashion soon. All on the digital version, like these lots. Some of you could be asking why should one read these mag? Well, for September issues... this is the answer [CLICK] September issue would not be the September issue without the mother of all September issues - which is none other than Vogue US. Continuing the tradition, the magazine is again as thick as the phonebook like before. Yet, it seems that the mag is reducing in number of pages, peaking when Lady Gaga took the cover in 2012, and declining as years go by. Is it a signal that economy is not doing well for Condé Nast? No comment.

3ddfa461-a842-4255-a006-8ea82da1428b	A Conversation with Steven Romick, First Pacific Advisors, and David Herro, Harris Associates. \n \n[buffett] \n \nH/T Dataroma \n Steven Romick & David Herro: Bottom-Up Investing In A Macro World by Litman Gregory Analytics  \nWe recently hosted an investment panel with FPA's Steven Romick and Harris Associates' David Herro. Romick serves as portfolio manager of FPA Crescent Fund and the FPA Contrarian Value product. Herro has managed the Oakmark International, Oakmark International Small Cap, and Oakmark Global Select funds since inception. The conversation, moderated by Litman Gregory chief investment officer Jeremy DeGroot, centered on how these fundamental stock pickers are navigating today's investment environment. \n \nYou are both bottom-up investors, but we're operating in a world where macroeconomic events can impact and overwhelm industries and individual companies. And these are certainly interesting macro times, particularly when we have examples such as Greece in the headlines. How do you balance or incorporate specific macro risks given your very bottom-up focus? \n \nDavid Herro: Well, if you back up, a company operates in an environment in which it either has a very fertile environment where you have strong demand growth and you have euphoria—people are buying your goods or if you're a business-to-business, the capital spending boom is on—[or it may be operating in not a fertile environment]. \n \nA lot of this environment depends on what's happening in the macroeconomy and with macroeconomic policy. \n \nI think all too often, we ignore what's happening in microeconomics. If you look at Europe, the whole European crisis—in my view—is more micro-driven than macro. \n \nEurope cannot compete—same with Japan, by the way—because of structural inefficiencies. Not because of some macro. What you have is structural inefficiencies leading to macro disturbances, in a way. Having said all of that, remember we're pricing a business based on its cash flow stream. So if there's a macroeconomic slowdown, it will impact the company's earnings stream for maybe a quarter or two. Or even a year or two. \n \nBut wait a minute. The value of the business is just not a function of the next couple quarters' or the next couple years' free cash flow. The value of the business is all those cash flow streams discounted into perpetuity. \n \nI think the big mistake people make is trying to play these macro cycles. Yes, you have to be aware how the businesses you're invested in are impacted by changes in the levels of aggregate demand, etc. \n \nAnd you also have to be aware of how they're impacted by the local rules of which they're operating in around the world. So, macro certainly is the biggest event or influence that people like to think about, and I think it's completely wrong. People should be looking at the company's ability to grow profit streams. They should be looking at the risk factors to those profit streams of which macroeconomics is a very small factor, generally speaking. \n \nAgain, it's a small factor because it affects it over the short term. And if a company has a strong enough balance sheet, we can analyze their ability to withstand macro shocks. \n \nIf this is the case, then we could use macroeconomic volatility as our friend. And I think one of the best examples for us is, if you remember in late 2008, when we all knew the world was in a recession, and a very stiff one, but we kind of piled into consumer discretionary stocks. Not because we thought, well, the world's going to bounce back in a couple months. But because the price of those businesses dropped like 60% and 70% and 80%—far more than what were the “safe” consumer staples stocks. \n \nSo, what was the barometer? Price. We knew that the companies were going to be impacted by the business cycle. And a very strong business cycle. \n \nBut then you go through it and look for companies that have the balance sheets, the brands, the capital position, the unique selling propositions that could withstand the weakness. Enabling us [to determine] that when the storm leaves, the stocks aren't [going to be] up 20% or 30%; but up 70% or 80%. \n \nSo, we like to look through the cycle and use the volatility of the macro economy to position the portfolio to the degree at which we could populate that portfolio with companies with the most economic upside. \n \nSteven Romick: You imposed the question by saying, “macro.” David had interpreted it to be macroeconomics. I'll just give it a little bit of a different spin. So I'll just call it macro-big-picture. \n \nSo I'll just put the question to all of you. Right? \n \nWe've never seen rates this low in our lifetimes. The perversion in asset prices that we've seen out there as a result of low interest rates is affecting many different parts of the world. And it's lifted all asset prices. \n \nSo a very, very smart friend of mine said very simplistically, “Look. So goes the 10-year, so goes the market.” Now obviously, again, it's a fairly trite view. But, it does beg the question, what happens to rates? \n \nAnd I, by the way, don't have a view. I'm not going to call it on the rates or direction or the timing or the magnitude. Anything like that. \n \nI tend not to engage in that. I do come back down to whether or not the business we buy is a good business and if it can operate successfully through whatever is coming our way. \n \nI do feel that [investors feel] a need to be invested because there is a lack of opportunity elsewhere. This has tended to lift prices to a level where we don't see the risk-rewards for our portfolio. \n \nWe have cash in our portfolio as a result. A lot of it. It's a byproduct, though, of the underlying [bottom-up] analysis of these businesses we're investing in or looking to invest in. \n \nSo, if we see something that meets our risk-reward, we'll buy it. I don't care about the environment. \n \nWe had 40% of the portfolio going into cash going into 2008. Then we just were buying distressed debt hand-over-fist in 2008 and 2009. I mean we were on the precipice of a depression. Now, I didn't know what was going to happen. Obviously, a depression didn't hit. But I didn't know how it was going to come out. \n \n  \n \nSee full article here . \n \nSteven Romick \n \nThe post Steven Romick: Bottom-Up Investing In A Macro World appeared first on ValueWalk . \n Like this article?

f115db03-0dd2-4ad3-af66-4740c6aafddb	(Reuters) - The Kentucky clerk's office that had refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples in defiance of orders by a federal judge on Friday morning began the process of ending that resistance. While Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis was jailed on Thursday for refusing to follow the orders of U.S. District Judge David Bunning, her deputies began processing a license for James Yates and William Smith, who had previously been denied in the quest for a marriage license on Friday.
3e3cee50-753a-45be-8b5e-992ae4c838e6	Move over, Boomers. You may have more money (for now), but Millennials have more people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Millennials now represent more than one-quarter of the nation’s population with 83.1 million people, compared to 75.4 million Boomers. And in a short time, Millennials will be the generation with the most financial pull. Source: Money Matters: How Affluent Millennials Are Living the Millennial Dream, The FutureCast That being said, how do brands attract this ever-so-illusive generation? Easy. Understand their wants and needs, and make their lives easier by solving an everyday problem. Some people say Millennials feel entitled, but there’s definitely more than what meets the eye. For example, Millennials… have strong brand loyalty. desire quick, but accurate results. have high expectations. are passionate about civic causes.  are plugged in and highly engaged on social media. Here are a couple of brands that are doing it right: Starbucks Mobile Order & Pay Who doesn’t love a pumpkin spice latte on a cool fall day? Okay, maybe that’s just me. But what happens when you’re in a hurry to make it to work on time and can’t afford to sit in the drive-through for 20 minutes? You order ahead, obviously. And with Starbucks’ mobile app, you can have your favorite beverage or snack waiting for you. With no added cost, it’s a no-brainer. Blue Apron Now that we’re living on our own, we’re faced with a new challenge. Cooking. We grew up loving mom’s home-cooked favorites, but we don't have the time (or, frankly, skills) to whip up pan-seared scallops with mushroom risotto from scratch. That’s where Blue Apron hit a home run. They deliver original recipes weekly, with pre-portioned fresh ingredients, straight to your door. So easy, my husband could do it.  If you’re hung up on where to start, there are three marketing objectives you should focus on right away to attract this demographic: Be authentic and genuine Keep it simple and effective Solve a problem Let me know: What other consumer-facing brands do you engage with because of their ability to accomplish these three goals?
12482e90-c11e-431a-ae68-2540cbcf0922	I've been in Marrakech for a few days now.\nIt's probably my second favorite city in Morocco. There is part of it that is almost like any big modern cities, but part of it that is very Moroccan. My favorite part of the city is probably joining the crowd at the main square where there are tons of food stalls, shopping, drummers, dancers, monkey acrobats, snake charmers, fortune tellers, jugglers, old medicine men, etc.\nIt's actually my last day in Morocco today. On my first day here, I walked passed a coffee place with only men sitting outside facing the street...it was intimidating. As a woman, I wondered if I was allowed to go in. If you do go in, men will stare at you as if you've done something wrong. It's still a men's world here...but I've met Rachida, a very independent woman...she taught me a lot about Moroccan culture. There are women who push and fight, women who drive cars, women in parliament, polygamous marriages are almost completely abolished and you're actually allowed to wear short shorts and spaghetti straps in bigger cities (unlike other middle eastern countries). A few years ago, women only went outside twice in their lifetime; on her wedding and on the day she dies. Now, if a man tells a woman to go back home, other women will stand up for her and tell the man to mind his own business.\nA lot of things we have in western countries is taken for granted, but we have to remember it's because there were women who fought for us to have those rights. It's such a young country...the older ones resists changes, but try to tell a younger one how it's done and he does exactly the opposite. It's a fascinating country here, and you feel the evolution when you're travelling from the country side to the bigger cities. It was a great lesson.\nTo be honest, the hot weather really isn't for me, and I've been sick the past few days...but I will miss desert, the medinas, the mountains and the people!
b12f0805-57dc-47ce-adbe-a7f09ec4fcbb	The latest developments as Russia and other nations counter Islamic State militants in Syria. All times local: \n\n9:05 p.m. \n\nIraq's prime minister is clarifying that his country's cooperation with Russia, Syria and Iran is for intelligence only and not a military cooperation. \n\nThe office of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi posted a statement on his official Facebook page saying that "Iraq has not agreed to establish a military coordination cell with the said countries, and any claim to the contrary is false." \n\nThe statement was issued hours after Russia announced its airstrikes in Syria and said the strikes were targeting the Islamic State group. \n\nRussia, Syria, Iran and Iraq startled the United States on Sunday when Iraq's military said the countries will begin sharing "security and intelligence" information to help combat the Islamic State group. \n\nEarlier Wednesday, Syrian state TV quoted the country's foreign minister as praising a new mechanism for coordination between the countries to combat terrorism. \n\n--- \n\n8:40 p.m. \n\nA moderate Western-backed Syrian rebel group says one of its leading officers has been killed in the Russian airstrikes in Syria's central Homs province. \n\nThe group said on its website Wednesday that Iyad al-Deek died in an airstrike in the rural north of Homs. Al-Deek was an officer in the Syrian army but defected soon after the Syrian revolution turned into a war in 2011. \n\nThe group didn't provide any more details. \n\nActivists and a rebel commander in Syria earlier Wednesday claimed the Russian airstrikes in the country have mostly hit moderate rebel positions and civilians. Russian officials have dismissed such claims. \n\n--- \n\n8:25 p.m. \n\nGermany's foreign minister says Russia's airstrikes in Syria don't diminish his concerns about the situation in the country and is calling for more information on the attacks. \n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier said on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York that there's no authoritative information yet on "the targets and methods of these airstrikes." He added that "Russia must have an interest of its own in ensuring that this is cleared up as quickly as possible." \n\nSteinmeier said that "in this heated situation, there is a great danger that there could be further misunderstandings." \n\nHe noted that his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov has said all must ensure that international efforts to fight the Islamic State group are coordinated, and said: "this also goes for Russian activities." \n\nSteinmeier insisted that there ultimately will be no military solution to Syria's conflict. \n\n--- \n\n8:20 p.m. \n\nSyria's foreign minister says his country strongly endorses "the initiative of President Putin" and is calling French and other airstrikes in Syria that aren't coordinated with his government a "blatant contravention" of international law. \n\nWalid al-Moallem spoke to the U.N. Security Council shortly after Russia announced its own airstrikes and circulated to council members a draft resolution aimed at coordinating global efforts in the fight against terror. \n\n"Those who really do want to fight terrorism in Syria need to cooperate their work with the government in Syria," al-Moallem told the council, and he urged everyone to follow Russia's call. \n\nHe also questioned what the council has done to fight terrorism. Russia's use of its veto has blocked several proposals on Syria. \n\n--- \n\n8:15 p.m. \n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States is prepared to welcome Russian military action in Syria as long as it is directed against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida affiliates. \n\nSpeaking at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, Kerry said that the U.S. would have "grave concerns" if Russia conducted strikes against other groups. And, he said Russian operations must not support Syrian President Bashar Assad or interfere with those of the U.S.-led coalition that is already attacking Islamic States targets. \n\nKerry spoke as Russia launched its first airstrikes in Syria targeting what it said were Islamic State positions. U.S. officials and others cast doubt on that claim, saying the Russians appeared to be attacking opposition groups fighting Syrian government forces. \n\n--- \n\n8:10 p.m. \n\nSyrian state TV is quoting the country's foreign minister as praising a new mechanism for coordination between Damascus, Russia, Iran and Iraq to combat terrorism. \n\nWalid al-Moallem was quoted by state TV Wednesday as discussing the new mechanism with his Iraqi counterpart at the sidelines of a United Nations' meetings in New York. \n\nIraq had previously said it will begin sharing intelligence with Syria, Russia and Iran to help combat the Islamic State group. \n\nAl-Moallem said the new mechanism provides a way for the four countries to coordinate their fight against terrorism. \n\n--- \n\n8:00 p.m. \n\nU.S. Senate Republicans are denouncing Russia's actions in Syria. \n\nSenator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the airstrikes "pretty incredible" and criticized President Barack Obama's administration for not taking a stronger stance against Russia. \n\nIn a speech on the Senate floor, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that initial reports are that Russian pilots were hitting targets not controlled by IS. \n\nHe said some strikes were near the city of Homs, which the militants do not control, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin's true intentions are to maintain a strong position in Syria and support Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n\nHe also criticized Obama for saying that the U.S. is willing to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the Syrian conflict. \n\n--- \n\n7:55 p.m. \n\nBritain's foreign minister says his country welcomes Russia's new "focus" on using force against the Islamic State group in Syria, but warns it's "very important that Russia be able to confirm that military action it has undertaken this morning" doesn't target Syria's moderate opposition. \n\nPhilip Hammond told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that actions in support of Syria's government are incompatible with the fight against terrorism. \n\nHammond said the international community will expect Russia to use the growing influence it has in Syria to pressure Syria's government not to use barrel bombs against civilians and to prevent any use of chemicals as weapons. \n\n--- \n\n7:40 p.m. \n\nFrance's Foreign Minister says "initial indications" show Russian airstrikes in Syria didn't target zones controlled by the Islamic State group, and said if confirmed this runs counter to a condition France has set on agreeing to join a Russian coalition against the extremists. \n\nLaurent Fabius says "verification is underway" to determine what the Russian strikes targeted, but that it currently appears they may have targeted zones held by Syrian opposition forces, who Russia considers terrorists seeking to overthrow its long-time ally Bashar Assad. \n\nFabius said France is not against the Russian proposal of an anti-IS coalition, but on three conditions: that strikes only target IS, that the Syrian regime end barrel bombing of civilian populations, and that negotiations for a political solution resume, with the understanding that Assad cannot be a part of the solution. \n\n--- \n\n7:35 p.m. \n\nA prominent member of Russia's parliament has suggested that Russia could strike beyond Syria if the extremists targeted by its airstrikes flee across the border. \n\n"When you poison an insect it's not enough to send it into the neighbors' kitchen," said Konstantin Kosachyov, who chairs the international affairs committee in the Russian parliament's upper house. "This would make our efforts to counter terrorism meaningless." \n\nKosachyov noted that President Vladimir Putin's request for authorization to use military force abroad did not specify the country, adding that this was intentional. \n\n--- \n\n7:30 p.m. \n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has told Russia's LifeNews TV station that reports of civilian casualties from the Russian airstrikes in Syria are part of an "information war." \n\nShe said "all this is the same sort of information attack, the same sort of information war, of which we hear so many times and which, it appears, someone prepared well." \n\nActivists and a rebel commander in Syria earlier Wednesday claimed the Russian airstrikes in the country have mostly hit moderate rebel positions and civilians. \n\n--- \n\n7:20 p.m. \n\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the use of Russian military force in Syria adds a "troubling" new development to the war in Syria and throws Assad a "life line." \n\nHe said it could be more destabilizing than Turkey's effort to combat the Kurds. \n\n"The Russian air campaign may be even more destructive if it targets moderate rebel forces fighting the Assad regime," Schiff said. \n\n"The increased longevity of the regime - made possible by this Russian intervention - will only prolong the civil war, which will continue as long as a regime that barrel bombs its own people remains in power," he said. \n\n--- \n\n7:05 p.m. \n\nThe U.S. conducted airstrikes in Syria as planned Wednesday including one near Aleppo, which is in the northwest but not near where the Russians were flying, a U.S. official said. \n\nThe official said the Russian officer who notified the U.S. of the strikes said the U.S. should stay out of Syrian airspace and remove any troops it has on the ground working with rebels in Syria. \n\nThe U.S. has repeatedly said it has no U.S. military forces on the ground in Syria. \n\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the missions publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\n—By Lolita Baldor and Robert Burns in Washington \n\n--- \n\n7:00 p.m. \n\nActivists and a rebel commander in Syria claim the Russian airstrikes in the country have mostly hit moderate rebel positions and civilians. \n\nIn a video released by the U.S.-backed rebel group Tajamu Alezzah, jets are seen hitting a building claimed to be a location of the group in the town of Latamna in the central Hama province. \n\nThe group commander Jameel al-Saleh told a local Syrian news website that the group's location was hit by Russian jets but didn't specify the damage. \n\nA group of local activists in the town of Talbiseh in Homs province recorded at least 16 civilians killed, including two children. A Syrian military official had earlier said the Russian jets hit this town. \n\nThe AP could not independently verify the claims. \n\n--- \n\n6:25 p.m. \n\nFormer CIA director, Gen. David Petraeus, has said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin's immediate objective in Syria is to solidify the corridor on the Mediterranean coast between Latakia where he has an air base and Tartus where he has a Russian naval base. \n\nAs he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, Petraeus said Putin also wants to help Syrian President Bashar Assad solidify his grip on the country, which has been increasingly challenged in recent months by the Islamic State and other opposition groups. \n\nPetraeus warned against partnering with Russia, Iran and Assad against IS and said the U.S. should deter any action by Russia involving any of the forces backed by the U.S. \n\n"If Russia wanted to fight ISIS, they could have joined the 60-plus member coalition that Gen. Allen has so capably put together and help drop bombs on ISIS. They have some capabilities that would be useful to that fight so this is clearly not what they're up to," he said. \n\n--- \n\n6:15 p.m. \n\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein says she thinks it's possible that Russia's move in Syria could be a positive development. \n\nFeinstein, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said help from "Russia and Iran in a political solution for Syria is important." \n\nFeinstein said the key is to defeat the Islamic State group and then to hold an election in Syria, and that the U.S. should cooperate with Russia. \n\nShe said it was important to "change the dynamic" because IS continues to encroach on other states. \n\n--- \n\n6:05 p.m. \n\nA senior U.S. official says Russia's airstrikes in Syria did not appear to be targeting the Islamic State group, but other opposition groups fighting against Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n\nThe official said IS militants are not in the western part of the country, beyond Homs, where the Russian strikes were directed. \n\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the Russian airstrikes publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\nRussia notified the U.S. about the impending airstrikes through the embassy in Baghdad about an hour before they started, the official said. \n\nAccording to the official, there were no conflicts with the Russian strikes, and they had no impact on the coalition missions, which are primarily in the north and east. \n\nThe U.S. is still trying to assess the damages of the Russian strikes. \n\n—By Lolita C. Baldor and Robert Burn in Washington. \n\n--- \n\n5:50 p.m. \n\nA U.S.-backed Syrian rebel group has claimed that Russian warplanes have hit its positions in central Syria. \n\nThe group, known as Tajamu Alezzah, wrote scornfully on Twitter Wednesday that "eradicating terrorism appears to begin with attacks" on its locations in the central city of Latamna in the province of Hama. \n\nThe group, which boasts of having TOW missiles, didn't provide specific details on the targets or how it can ascertain the strikes were by Russian jets. \n\nWashington has equipped and trained a number of moderate Syrian rebel groups but most have been crushed by al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria. \n\n--- \n\n5:45 p.m. \n\nRussia's foreign minister is telling the foreign ministers of world powers that his country is "ready to forge standing channels of communication to ensure a maximally effective fight against terrorist groups" with the United States and other countries. \n\nSergey Lavrov spoke Wednesday to the U.N. Security Council shortly after Russia's defense ministry announced its jets are carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State group positions in Syria. \n\nLavrov said Russia would shortly circulate a draft council resolution to promote joint efforts against groups like the Islamic State. \n\nLavrov addressed the council during a major U.N. gathering of world leaders. Russia is chairing the meeting as the council president this month. \n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also is expected to address the meeting. \n\n--- \n\n5:35 p.m. \n\nA Syrian military official says Russian warplanes have targeted positions of the Islamic State group in central Syria. \n\nSyrian state TV quotes an unnamed military official as saying that the air raids are part of the "Russian-Syrian agreement to fight international terrorism and wipe out the Daesh organization." \n\nThe official used an Arabic acronym to refer to the Islamic State group. \n\nThe official said on Wednesday that the air raids targeted the extremists' positions in central Syria including the areas of Rastan and Talbiseh, as well as areas near the town of Salamiyeh in Hama province. \n\nThe official said the Russian airstrikes were in cooperation with the Syrian air force. \n\n--- \n\n5:00 p.m. \n\nPentagon's press secretary says Defense Secretary Ash Carter has instructed his staff to talk to Russian officials about how to keep each other's air operations in Syria from colliding or getting in each other's way. \n\nPeter Cook said it was not yet clear when these talks would start or who would participate. \n\nRussia's defense ministry earlier Tuesday said its jets have started carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State group positions in Syria. \n\nA U.S. led coalition has been targeting IS militants in Syria and Iraq since last year. \n\nRussia and the U.S. are at odds over the Russian involvement because Washington has said Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is a key ally of Moscow, must be removed from power. \n\n--- \n\n4:20 p.m. \n\nRussia's defense ministry says its jets are carrying out airstrikes on Islamic State positions in Syria. \n\nThe ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told Russian news agencies on Wednesday that Russian jets are carrying out targeted airstrikes on the positions, vehicles and warehouses that Russia believes belong to IS militants. \n\nEarlier Wednesday, Russia's upper chamber of parliament gave the green light to President Vladimir Putin's request to use Russian forces in Syria. A Kremlin official said the move was to protect Russia's national security, since at least 2,400 Russians have gone to fight in Syria or Iraq. \n\nSyrian President Bashar Assad is a key ally of Moscow.
a9ab5a03-6d39-4a4d-b415-3b5a70631854	French tailor who got the measure of nine US presidents \n\nGeorges de Paris in his shop in 2002 \n\nComments \n\nGeorges de Paris, who has died aged 81, was a one-time vagrant who became the “Tailor to the Presidents”; in a career spanning five decades he designed suits for every American head of state from Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama. \n\nAs the proprietor of his shop, “Georges de Paris, custom tailor”, three blocks from the White House, he measured the inside leg of nine American presidents, but in the 1950s he had been a homeless Frenchman sleeping rough on the streets of Washington and, reportedly, bathing in the Potomac River. \n\nDe Paris was a short, corpulent man with a mane of silver white hair that bounced on his shoulders . He had an impenetrable Marseille accent and a liking for red bow ties and braces and oversized rings. Gerald Ford teased him about his size, asking in jest if he played American football. \n\nGeorges De Paris at work in 2002  Photo: AFP \n\nReflecting on his famous clients, De Paris recalled that Ronald Reagan was particularly charming, and knew his cloth: “[He] spoke a lot. He, like George W, knew how to appreciate the quality of fabrics. He gave me jelly beans and was always afraid that I would prick him with my needles during the fitting.” \n\nGeorge de Paris was born in Marseille in 1934 (his exact date of birth is unknown). In the late-1950s he left France for America, spurred on by a love affair with an American woman, arriving with his life savings of $4,000. He moved in with his girlfriend but when De Paris would not marry her he was sent on his way. He spent several months on the streets of Washington, sleeping in a park within sight of the White House. \n\nAfter getting a job as a cutter for a French-Canadian tailor he saved enough to buy a sewing machine and later to set up his own shop. He became an American citizen in 1969. \n\nDe Paris hit the big time in 1963 when he made a suit for Lyndon Johnson. “Congressman Otto Passman introduced him to me,” De Paris recalled. “This guy’s a good tailor, but he no speak English”. A tradition was born, although it was never an official role. \n\nGeorges de Paris with George W Bush \n\n“Each president has got a different charisma,” De Paris observed. “I tell them, wear something that fits your personality.” During fittings – watched over by Secret Service agents – Nixon was cordial and Carter quiet. De Paris found the “friendliest and also the most elegant” of his presidential customers to be George W Bush and Reagan – the latter was wearing one of his suits when he was shot by John Hinckley in 1981. Although George Bush Snr was “not the most agreeable” it was Bill Clinton who most irritated De Paris: he was “very demanding, cold and always occupied”. One feature united them: “Presidents all prefer dark colours.” \n\nHis other clients included Kofi Annan and Michael Bloomberg. In 2010 De Paris told Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF chief, who was then being touted as a future French president but who was later disgraced, that “if you wear my suit, you’ll win the election”. \n\nFond of cheese and wine, De Paris would often end the day at the Old Ebbitt Grill, Washington’s oldest restaurant. During his time in presidential circles he always focused on the task at hand. “I want to stay away from the politics,” De Paris said. “I want to be a tailor.” \n\nHe never married. \n\nGeorges de Paris, born 1934, died 13 September 13 2
2841ea9b-9e7a-4d40-b55c-7745035dfdf8	A billionaire politician under investigation for corruption in Malaysia faces allegations his family companies have laundered millions of dollars through the Australian real estate market. A billionaire politician under investigation for corruption in Malaysia faces allegations his family companies have laundered millions of dollars through the Australian real estate market. The allegations against the family of Sarawak governor Taib Mahmud are contained in a report, obtained by Fairfax Media, by an anti-corruption organisation in Switzerland concerned with logging of rainforests in Borneo and displacement of its indigenous people.\n\nIn its report, "The Adelaide Hilton Case – how a Malaysian politician's family laundered $30 million in South Australia", the Bruno Manser Fund (a Swiss non-government organisation) exposes the corporate connections behind Taib's company Sitehost, which owns Adelaide's $50 million Hilton Hotel.\n\nMajor hotels chains like Hilton normally manage and lend their name to properties that are owned by other parties.\n\nTaib Mahmud was a Colombo Plan graduate of University of Adelaide and a substantial benefactor to his old alma mater. He was given an honorary doctorate and had a part of the campus named after him. The University has refused to say how much money it has received from Taib despite although a spokesman said not donations were received in the last eight years. Malaysian investigation\n\nThe Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) announcing in June 2011 that the billionaire politician was under investigation for corruption.\n\nUnder Taib's governorship, nearly 90 per cent of Sarawak's native rainforests have been logged. Despite his modest income as a politician, the family of Taib Mahmud has interests in more than 400 companies in 25 countries.\n\nThe report questions how the Taib family could afford to finance the purchase of this major hotel and also a key loan in the deal which together totalled some $30 million in the early 1990s.\n\nTaib's daughter and son-in-law became shareholders of an Australian company, Sitehost, after the family bought shares worth $9.5 million in 1993.\n\nThe report says that when Sitehost acquired the Hilton hotel the following year, it took an unsecured loan of $20.75 million "from a non-bank lender whose identity remained undisclosed for over ten years". Queensland move\n\nSitehost revealed in 2007 that the lender was Victorian company Golborne Pty Ltd. The report tracks how that loan was then transferred to another company, Fordland, located in Queensland.\n\nThe last available financial accounts for Sitehost are from 2011 and show its main liability was a loan of $18.5 million to Fordland.\n\nThe accounts describe a company with 361 employees, revenue of $1.3 million and assets of $52 million (primarily the Hilton).\n\nAccording to the report, there is strong circumstantial evidence, including a shadow structure on the Isle of Man, that Golborne Australia and Fordland Australia represented the same beneficial owners: the Taib family. Late accounts\n\nOfficial records are lacking. As a large proprietary company, Sitehost is required to file annual financial statements with The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\nIts latest annual accounts however were filed in 2013 for the 2011 financial year. There were no accounts filed from the 1998 to 2006. Ernst & Young are the auditors and National Australia the banker.\n\nASIC declined to say whether it had taken or intended to take any action in regards of the breaches.\n\n"We can't comment on the specifics of your query and any allegations about money laundering should be directed to AUSTRAC as it is Australia's anti-money laundering regulator," said a spokesman\n\n"ASIC is one of a number of agencies, including AUSTRAC, that forms the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. This taskforce was set up to address the threat that serious financial crime poses to the integrity of Australia's financial and regulatory systems."\n\nAccording to its most recent filings, Sitehost's directors are Jamilah Taib (Taib Mahmud's daughter), her Canadian husband Sean Murray – who lives in the second most expensive private residence in Ottowa - and two Australian lawyers, Gary Patrick Doherty and John Antoine Kiosoglous.\n\nContacted by Fairfax Media, Gary Doherty said he did not know the source of the funds behind Golborne or Fordland. 'Conceal', but no subterfuge\n\nDoherty is a partner at the Sydney law firm Low Doherty & Stratford and a director of property development companies, one of which bears the name "Conceal Pty Ltd".\n\nDoherty said there was "no subterfuge" in the name Conceal.\n\n"When you used to buy shelf companies they were always running out of names. The name was just a word that was there," he said.\n\nThe other local director of Sitehost, John Kiosoglous, was unavailable for comment. Questions were put to him via a third party.\n\nDoherty said he was aware of the money laundering allegations but had no involvement in money laundering. Nor did he know the source of the funds from Golborne or Fordland.\n\nThere is no allegation that either director has been involved in money laundering. Swapping Guernsey\n\nBesides the Taib family, with a 95 per cent holding, the other shareholder in Sitehost is a Guernsey company, not a British Virgin Islands company as disclosed to ASIC.\n\n"By indicating that Astar (this other shareholder with five per cent) is a Guernsey rather than a BVI company, Sitehost's official shareholder information is clearly misleading and likely in breach of ASIC regulations. This might be interpreted as an attempt to conceal the real ownership of Sitehost," says the report.\n\nBruno Manser is calling on Australian authorities to investigate the Taib family interests, as the fund has already done in Canada and the UK. A representative Lukas Straumann has scheduled a press conference for 9.30am Wednesday at the Adelaide Hilton.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, South Australian MP Mark Parnell read out a motion in parliament expressing concern at the destruction of Malaysian rainforests and the connections between the Taib family, University of Adelaide and the Adelaide Hilton.\n\nHe called on the South Australian to investigate the allegations. The motion is expected to be filed on Wednesday. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.
8b1af6c6-4674-45a0-b806-1ec9bb6a2336	Labor’s role in Abbott’s policy shift should not be overlooked. \n       Tiny Abbot's Bittersweet refugee symphony  \nAustralia's decision to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees and begin air strikes on Islamic State target is a bittersweet mix. Rocco Fazzari and Denis Carnahan with apologies to The Verve (n Mick n Keith). \n PT1M12S   620  349    \nRemember when the prestige of governing was considered good for a percentage point or two, all other things being equal? The presumed advantage of incumbency. But now? \n\nIn the era of uncommitted voters and instant communication, competitors for office live from issue to issue. It can be brutal. Yet within that volatility, there is one advantage of power that oppositions still do not enjoy: being there. Distinct from prestige, "being there" is the singular responsibility falling to governments to respond to events and the opportunity therein to get their responses right. \n  \nBy promising to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees  … [Abbott] … had perhaps for the first time in his troubled prime ministership, eschewed his normal reflex to view things as simple left-right binaries, opting for unity rather than division.   \n  \nBefore this week, Tony Abbott had almost never done this, and it shows in his figures. Monday marked his two-year anniversary as Prime Minister. Newspoll that morning (kindly brought forward from its customary Tuesday release) showed the Coalition still 8 points off Labor on 46-54. That's 30 Newspolls now without a single government lead. When Fairfax-Ipsos and other regular polls are added in, Abbott's dud run nudges 180. \n \n Illustration: Simon Letch \n  \nCrucially, Newspoll's latest survey also showed him trailing Bill Shorten as better prime minister and that the Coalition had gone backwards, not forwards, on every indicator measured on election in 2013. Party room chatter about replacing the Prime Minister and Treasurer Joe Hockey immediately ticked up. Despair deepened. \n \nYet a week that began so miserably ended on something of a high. The reasons were surprising: an escalating international humanitarian crisis, an emboldened Labor Party, an upwelling of pro-refugee Liberals, and an unlikely press conference on Wednesday which cast Abbott in a new and unfamiliar role: that of Prime Minister of Australia. \n\nWhen Abbott confounded critics by promising to take in 12,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey, everything changed. \n\nFlanked by his foreign affairs and defence ministers, Julie Bishop and Kevin Andrews respectively, and the Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin, the PM's demeanour was uncommonly forward and inclusive. He had not only stared down a noisy chorus of divisive lightweights in his party room – dubbed the knuckle-draggers – he had perhaps for the first time in his troubled prime ministership, eschewed his normal reflex to view things as simple left-right binaries, opting for unity rather than division. In short, he had taken a step towards the middle point of politics, towards Labor. \n\nIt was a big moment for the Abbott operation which has too often resembled a combat unit than a national government. Here, on the incendiary issue of asylum seekers of all things, Abbott had demonstrated to his trenchant critics in the party room, that he could change, could learn, and was capable of hearing the mainstream over the strident ravings of favoured shock jocks. \n\nLabor's role in Abbott's policy shift, should not be overlooked either. Considering the electoral damage it had sustained over its disastrous boats policy while in office, the fact that Shorten, his deputy Tanya Plibersek, and his immigration spokesman, Richard Marles, felt inclined to strike out boldly on Monday calling for $100 million of new aid, and a 10,000 place immediate intake of Syrians, is significant. \n\nAs one Labor insider noted, Abbott's announcement was a function of how far the centre point of refugee policy has moved in recent months. "It was the first time the Coalition has come towards us in the immigration/asylum seeker policy space, probably since the Tampa crisis in 2001 when the consensus collapsed," he said. \n\nTwo things emboldened Labor's call. The first was its national conference decision in July, driven by Marles, to drop its contemptuous opposition and instead embrace the full suite of government policies directed against people smuggling – including turn-backs if needed. \n\nThat shift, impossible for many in the party's left to swallow, was tactically wise but more importantly, it was morally correct. Its dividend is already apparent in a more compassionate policy overall. The proof is the extent to which Shorten was able to get back on the front foot on refugees and to advocate the expansion of the orderly resettlement of displaced persons – both through Labor's proposed permanent doubling to 27,000, and though the one-off 10,000-place Syrian increase. Its importance in the broader political contest, cannot be overstated either because in consigning the chaos, anxiety, and maritime deaths of unregulated boat arrivals to the past, it has neutralised one of Abbott's most valuable lines of attack. \n\nThe second game changer was the public intervention of progressive Liberals such as NSW Premier Mike Baird and federal MPs like Craig Laundy and Russell Broadbent, following worldwide revulsion at pictures of a drowned Syrian toddler on a Turkish beach. \n\nThe net result of these factors also weighed on Abbott who for a change, decided not to go to the mattresses when faced with party room opposition – as he had on climate change and same-sex marriage. That he did not is even more surprising given that as recently as Sunday he had clearly stipulated that any Syrian intake would be handled within the existing humanitarian program capped at 13,750 places a year. \n\nA final notable factor in Abbott's rapid "journey", was the observance of proper decision-making processes. That began with dispatching Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to Europe to discuss Australia's response, and followed with two cabinet meetings, a meeting of the national security committee, and three party room meetings. \n\nOf course, whether Abbott's brains trust has learned from its excursion into building national unity, remains to be seen. \n\nMark Kenny is Fairfax Media's chief political correspondent.
cef20b88-aeb4-400e-a122-471b0282b12c	(BPT) - Jack Whelan never missed his daily power walk. But at 58, he began to lose pace and grew concerned. Were his headaches and occasional nosebleeds normal signs of age, or were they something else? \n  \nIn 2006, after discussing his symptoms with his doctor, Whelan was diagnosed with a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. After reviewing treatment options, Whelan made the decision to explore participating in a clinical trial. \n \nTaking part in clinical trials helps doctors and scientists better understand how cancer cells respond to different treatments, what characteristics to look for to diagnose cancer sooner and how certain cancers might be prevented. Clinical trials can also offer the chance for patients to receive investigational treatments that might offer some improvement over standard treatment. \n \nOver the past nine years, Whelan has participated in seven clinical trials to treat his disease, and encourages other people with cancer to take an active role in exploring treatment options, including clinical trials. \n \n“I warn other people with cancer against taking a ‘car-wash’ approach, or passively accepting whatever is advised,” Whelan says. “I understand that not every person will make the same decision to participate in multiple trials, but it’s important to get a second opinion, be proactive about your care and explore all your options.” \n \nAccording to research from the Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation, many people who are aware of cancer clinical trials are hesitant to participate due to common misconceptions. For example, some fear they won’t receive quality care in a trial setting. Others are hesitant to join a trial because they think they might be in a study group that receives no treatment at all. Further, many people lack information about clinical trials available for their specific type of cancer. In fact, in one survey of people with cancer published in the Journal of Community and Supportive Oncology, only 16 percent were aware of trials relevant to their disease, and 65 percent noted this lack of awareness as the chief barrier to their participation in a study. Low awareness and participation is a major reason why less than half of all clinical trials achieve minimal enrollment, delaying important new studies to test potential new medicines and treatment approaches. \n \nWhelan was aware of clinical trials and engaged his doctor in a discussion about multiple treatment approaches. Today, he is focusing on spending time with his wife and six grandchildren. \n \n“Some people think that clinical trials are a last resort, but this does not have to be the case,” Whelan says. “Cancer is a nasty, nasty thing to have, but I just have this confidence that science is going to help me get through this.” \n \nFor more information about cancer clinical trials, including information on some of the common misconceptions and ways to discuss cancer clinical trials with your doctors and loved ones, visit ACT (About Clinical Trials) at www.LearnAboutClinicalTrials.org . There you will find helpful videos and perspectives from experts from the medical community, more stories from people like Whelan, who have participated in clinical trials. ACT was created by Genentech and the American Cancer Society to help people learn more about clinical trials and access informative resources to help them make educated decisions about their treatment. ACT is available to everyone and requires no enrollment or registration. \n \nClinical trials: Common concerns vs. truths \n \n* Will I be an experiment? Cancer clinical trials are developed with the highest medical and ethical standards, and participants are consistently treated with care and respect. \n \n* Will I receive a placebo? Cancer clinical trials rarely use a placebo alone if an effective treatment is available. \n \n* Is this my last resort? Trials can study everything from prevention to early- and late-stage treatment, and may be an option at any point after your diagnosis. \n \n* Will I receive quality care? Many procedures are in place to help you receive quality care throughout your experience.
f49af9ca-609a-4bdf-baf8-d8ddd6dd4628	, EDT. OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso - Burkina Faso is freezing the assets of the leaders of the coup launched earlier this month, the state prosecutor said Saturday. An investigation will determine who will stand trial for the short-lived rebellion, the prime minister announced earlier.\n\nAssets will be frozen for three months for 14 individuals, including coup leader Gen. Gilbert Diendere and his wife Fatou Diendere, a parliamentary member of the former ruling party, Laurent Poda said in a statement released Saturday. They will be restricted to withdrawals of 300,000 CFA ($512) each month, he said. The assets of three political parties have also been frozen, he said.\n\nThe elite presidential guard arrested Interim President Michel Kafando and Prime Minister Yacouba Isaac Zida on Sept. 16. Diendere then took power, but stepped down after pressure from the West African regional bloc, Burkina Faso's military and demonstrating citizens. Kafando and Zida were reinstalled as the transitional government on Wednesday.\n\nZida said Friday a 30-day investigation will be launched into the coup. Those found to have played significant roles will go to court, he said. The others will be reintegrated into the army.\n\nKafando on Friday signed a decree to disband the presidential guard. He also fired its commander and the country's security minister, according to the edict announced on national television.\n\nBurkina Faso's armed forces said that they started disarming the presidential guard Friday. The elite force of about 1,300 was formed by former President Blaise Compaore, who was ousted in October. Its members mounted the coup, unhappy that Compaore supporters were barred from running in elections.\n\nThe vote was scheduled for Oct. 11 — but Prime Minister Zida said elections are postponed for several weeks.\n\nAt least 11 people died and 271 were wounded in violence after the coup, the government said.

c7dfcf6e-76ce-477c-ab9c-f2b64c7709c8	By Perry Stein \n   The activists leading a rally in favor of gun control Thursday in front of the Capitol were speaking on behalf of loved ones who no longer could. \n    Richard Martinez’s 20-year-old son, Christopher, was shot and killed in the 2014 Isla Vista, California, shooting. DeAndra Yates’s 13-year-old son was shot in the head by a stray bullet while attending a friend’s birthday party in Indiana, left unable to speak or walk. The Rev. Sharon Risher lost her mother and two cousins in June’s Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting. \n    Most recently, Andy Parker’s daughter, Alison, was one of two people fatally shot outside Roanoke, Virginia, during a live television newscast. \n \n    “I come here in a state of raw and consuming grief,” said Parker, who has become a prominent gun-control activist in the weeks since his 24-year-old daughter’s death. “I’m not here because I want to be here; I am here because I have to be here.” \n    The hundreds of activists at Thursday’s “Whatever it Takes” rally — named after Parker’s mantra proclaiming that he will do “whatever it takes” to stop gun violence — did not call on Congress to pass sweeping gun reform laws, but narrowly lobbied for legislation that would mandate stricter background checks. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., unsuccessfully pushed for such legislation in 2013 in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting. After high-profile shootings this past summer, there is renewed interest among gun-control advocates to revive that legislation. \n \n    Virginia Democratic Sens. Timothy Kaine and Mark Warner and Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe spoke at the rally, which was organized by Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization working to end gun violence formerly known as Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Most in attendance wore red shirts with the words “whatever it takes,” some donning ribbons honoring the victims of shootings at Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook. \n \n    “There’s nothing contradictory between background checks and the Second Amendment,” Warner said. “We can take the next step on background checks — not next year, but this year.” \n    Kaine, who was governor of Virginia when a gunman fatally shot 32 people at Virginia Tech, introduced legislation Tuesday that would hold gun dealers accountable for selling weapons to people who are barred from owning them. \n    “That’s why we’re here,” Kaine said. “We have got to act. The way you don’t let grief turn into despair is to act.” \n    The gun-control movement might have Virginia’s top Democrats on its side, but pushing gun-related legislation through Congress won’t be easy. When the Manchin-Toomey legislation failed, Democrats controlled the Senate. Republicans now have control of both chambers, making the odds of legislative success that much slimmer. \n \n    On Thursday, activists called out Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., whose district includes the Roanoke area where Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward were shot, for not giving more attention to gun-violence measures. Goodlatte chairs the House Judiciary Committee, which controls legislation pertaining to guns. \n \n    “I will meet with anyone, anytime, any place,” Parker said. “So Rep. Goodlatte, I am waiting for your call. But I am here to say, if you are not in favor of background checks, we’ll find someone who is.” \n    Goodlatte’s office said Thursday afternoon that the two are scheduled to meet Friday. Goodlatte wouldn’t say whether he is in favor of expanded background checks, adding that there are laws in place that aren’t being enforced. \n    “I look forward to speaking again tomorrow with Mr. Parker and looking for additional ways to reduce gun violence, while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens,” Goodlatte wrote in an email. “At the same time, as I have previously pointed out to the administration, many of our nation’s gun laws are not enforced, and the Obama administration should take immediate steps to fully enforce the gun laws already on the books.” \n \n    Colin Goddard, who survived four gunshot wounds at Virginia Tech and is now a senior policy advocate for Everytown for Gun Safety, said he wishes people like Richard Martinez and Andy Parker never had to bury their children to become spokesmen for the cause. He said he hopes a shift in popular opinion can lead to incremental changes in the law. \n    “I wish none of these people were here. I wish I didn’t know Andy Parker,” he said. “But now that I do, let’s do something about it.” \n    
6f61a7ed-7a37-446f-b577-f6fd5b81dc81	 \nAn official release issued here this evening read "the government has ordered the disengagement of Additional Advocate General, Jammu, Vishal Sharma and Deputy Advocate General, Parimoksh Seth with immediate effect. \n\nAs the beef ban controversy continues to polarize the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the Mufti Sayeed-led PDP-BJP government on Tuesday disengaged its Jammu-based Additional Advocate General Vishal Sharma and Deputy Advocate General Parimoksh Seth, apparently for their role in the matter. \n\nAn official release issued here this evening read “the government has ordered the disengagement of Additional Advocate General, Jammu, Vishal Sharma and Deputy Advocate General, Parimoksh Seth with immediate effect. Orders to this effect were issued today \n\n’’. \n\nGiving four weeks time to the government to file its response in a PIL seeking enforcement of already existing law prohibiting the slaughter of a bovine animal and its subsequent sale by anyone in the state, a division bench comprising Justice Dhiraj Singh Thakur and Justice Janak Raj Kotwal had on September 9 directed the Director General of Police to order all the district police heads and SHOs to ensure strict compliance of the RPC provisions, which provide for imprisonment and fine to anyone slaughtering a bovine animal or selling such slaughtered animal. \n\nThe Public Interest Litigation was filed in 2014 by Parimoksh Seth who later this year was engaged as Deputy Advocate General by the state government. \n\nThe high court order, however, drew angry protests from Valley with local politicians, religious and social leaders threatening to defy ban on coming Eid. Reacting to it, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders at Jammu have threatened economic blockade of Valley in case bovine animals were slaughtered on Eid. \n\nWith traders in Valley announcing to snap trade ties with their counterpart in Jammu in case VHP went ahead with its threat, the controversy is threatening to divide Jammu and Kashmir state on regional and religious lines as was the case during 2008 Amarnath land row agitation. To cool down tempers in the Valley, the state government had earlier shifted Vishal Sharma from Home to a comparatively less sensitive Education Department and asked Parimoksh Seth to withdraw the PIL. \n\nHowever, while Sharma had conveyed his displ…

Photo CC-BY JaneA Kelley \n \nI let my 6-month-old cat leave the safe room when she felt comfortable. She has has a hell of a time exploring the kitty proofed apartment. However, she retreats underneath couch (which I left unblocked, so she has somewhere to hide) when she is seemingly tired or skittish. I need to leave the apartment and go to sleep, so I desperately need to get her back in the safe room. How do I do this without scaring her or forcing her? \n \n~ Kathryn \n \nThomas: Well, Kathryn, we’re not sure from your letter why you need to keep your new cat in her safe room whenever you’re asleep or not home. Do you have another cat you’re concerned about? \n \nBella: If your 6-month-old is the only cat in the house, she actually needs to have the chance to explore the whole place on her terms. The safe room is a great idea for when you first bring her home, but if she’s the only kitty, it’s good to let her out to check out her new home after a couple of days. \n \nThomas: If you’re concerned that she may not know where her litter box and food are, you can always put another litter box in one of the common areas so she doesn’t have to go too far in order to do her business. \n \nBella: Since you’ve said your apartment has been carefully cat-proofed, we don’t think you need to worry too much about her getting in trouble or getting hurt while you’re away. \n \nThomas: But if you do need to coax her out, the best way to do so is with a toy. \n \nBella: Few cats can resist the allure of a “thing on a string,” so that’s what we recommend. \n \nThomas: If you use a toy like Da Bird or Neko Flies (both of which we love) or even a little toy mouse on the end of a shoelace, and you make it move like an object of prey, your kitten will come out of hiding to check it out. \n \nBella: It’s just feline nature! \n \nThomas: Playing with her using one of these toys is also a great way to build her confidence and get her out from under the furniture when you’re home, too. \n \nBella: In this video, a little British Blue kitten is playing with a thing-on-a-string toy, and you can see how it gets him excited and wanting to explore! \n \n\n \nThomas: So, Kathryn, coax your cat out of hiding and build her confidence by playing with her, and you’ll soon see that she settles happily into her new home. \n \nBella: And make sure you play with her every day so she can get her crazies out in a healthy way that doesn’t involve knocking things over. Also, give her plenty of toys she can play with on her own. \n \nThomas: You should see Bella playing kitty soccer with her toys, running all over the house, hurling them up in the air and catching them … it’s so much fun she even gets me going sometimes! \n \nBella: Don’t forget to put the thing-on-a-string toy away in a closet when you’re done using it. You don’t want her to get into trouble and eat the string or anything. \n \nThomas: That’s right. Eating string and ribbon can be very bad for your cat because it can get stuck in her intestines and cause a blockage. \n \nBella: So, Kathryn, we hope that helps. \n \nThomas: What about you other readers? Do you have tips on coaxing a shy kitty out from under or behind the furniture? Please share your ideas in the comments.
c976e1b5-0635-42be-8512-021a5953fca9	The first womb transplant in the UK will take place within months after doctors were given the go-ahead for the procedure. \n \n\t\t \nTen British women without wombs will get the chance to carry their own babies after approval was granted by a special committee at Imperial College London. \n  Around one in 5,000 women in the UK are born without a womb.   \nA clinical trial will launch in the spring and more than 100 women have been identified as potential recipients of donor wombs. \n\n\t\t\t \nAround one in 5,000 women is born without a womb, while others lose their womb to cancer. \n\n\n\n \nRichard Smith will lead the team hoping to perform the UK's first ever womb transplant following the success of the procedure in Sweden. \n\nMr Smith said childlessness could be a "disaster" for couples, but the technique would offer hope to those whose only other option is surrogacy or adoption. \n  Sophie Lewis, pictured with partner Tilden Lamb, hopes to be one of ten British women who will get the chance to carry their own babies after doctors received the go-ahead for the first ever womb transplants in the UK   \nIf the trial is successful, the first British baby born as a result of a womb transplant could arrive in late 2017 or 2018, with more in the future. \n\nMr Smith, 55, a consultant gynaecologist at the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, has been working on the project for 19 years. \n\n\t\t\t \nHe said he was "really, really pleased" to have been granted approval for the move, which follows the birth of a baby boy in Sweden last year. \n\nHe said: "I've met many of the women who want this and it's really important for them and their partners. \n\n"There is no doubting that, for many couples, childlessness is a disaster. \n\n"Infertility is a difficult thing to treat for these women. Surrogacy is an option but it does not answer the deep desire that women have to carry their own baby. \n\n\t\t\t \n"For a woman to carry her own baby - that has to be a wonderful thing." \n\nThe 10 women who will be selected for the trial must all meet strict criteria, which includes being 38 or under, having a long-term partner and being a healthy weight. \n\nMore than 300 women have approached the Womb Transplant UK team, of whom 104 meet the criteria. \n\nBefore the trial starts, embryos will be created and frozen using each woman's eggs and sperm from her partner. \n\nThe women will then undergo a six-hour transplant operation to receive a womb from a donor who is classed as brain dead but whose heart has been kept beating. \n\n\t\t\t \nAfter 12 months on immunosuppressant drugs and close monitoring, each woman will be implanted with one of her embryos, with the hope of achieving a successful pregnancy. \n\nAny baby would be delivered by Caesarean section to prevent the donor womb going through the stresses and strains of labour. \n\nMr Smith said the trial would use deceased donors rather than living ones owing to the complexities of the operation. \n\n"Donor retrieval is a bigger operation than transplanting the uterus into the recipient," he said. "We don't want to subject a live donor to that operation." \n\nSix months after giving birth, each woman will be given the option of trying for one more baby, or the womb will be removed by surgeons. \n\nThis is to minimise the risk of keeping women on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives, which have side-effects, including an increased risk of cancer. \n\nMr Smith needs to raise £500,000 for the trial. \n\n"I've always been an enormous optimist," he said. "The project has run with no money from the start. Somehow or other, somebody has always turned up and given us enough money to keep it going." \n\nOrgan donor co-ordinators have suggested that around five wombs per year could be made available to the surgical team. \n\n\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.
64f6cead-ac39-4ab1-894c-496407ea0081	Emergency services are working to free two teenagers trapped in a school bus which overturned amid torrential rainfall and heavy flooding in north Cork. \n\nA school bus carrying a reported 30 students overturned in north Cork this morning. \n\nFire Brigade units from Fermoy, assisted by gardai, are working to free two trapped youngsters after more than 30 were freed following the accident. \n\nTorrential rainfall and flooding is being blamed for the accident which occurred at Cregg South on the Ballyhooly-Fermoy road in north Cork. \n\nThe accident happened just after 8.15am as the 30 seat coach was bringing students to Fermoy. \n\nIt is understood all the students are teenagers attending secondary schools in the Fermoy area. \n\nThe road remains closed and a special emergency plan has been put in place. \n\nThe coach was left lying partially on its roof. \n\nThere are no reports at this stage of any injuries. \n\nMotorists have been urged to avoid the area while emergency services attend the scene. \n\nSchools are liaising with the Gardai to keep parents informed. \n\nThe accident happened less than 12 hours after a 65-year-old man was killed when his car got caught in floods on Achill Island in Co Mayo. \n\nThe incident happened near Doogort on Achill Island at around 10pm yesterday. \n\nIt is understood that the man was pronounced dead at the scene, and a post mortem is due to be carried out at Mayo General Hospital. \n\nGardaí are investigating the incident. \n\nThe status orange rainfall warning remains in place for Kerry until midday, while the status yellow warning for Galway, Mayo and Clare, Cork and Limerick will also remain in place until the same time. Forecasters have warned that up to 70mm of rain will fall over Kerry before noon. \n\nThe worst driving conditions last night were in Clifden, Co Galway and Achill, Co Mayo, according to AA Roadwatch spokesperson Arwen Foley. \n\nLate last night, gardaí in Clifden warned motorists to travel only in exceptional circumstances due to extremely heavy rainfall. \n\nOvernight rainfall hampered driving conditions, and Sky road in Clifden was closed due to a small landslide onto the road, while Beach road was closed due to flooding. Road closures were also enforced in the Cleggan area. \n\nLast night, a part of the Ring of Kerry – between Kells and Caherciven – was impassable, but this road has since reopened. \n\n“In Kerry it stopped raining at around 11pm last night. There was flooding in a few places and parts of west Kerry seem to have been worst affected.” \n\nRoad conditions are described as slippery due to surface water. \n\nMs Foley said a few roads around Tralee were flooded and rendered impassable last night, and though these roads have reopened care is still needed. \n\nThe road between Mulranny and Achill in Mayo is now passable again, AA Roadwatch says. \n\nThe latest warnings came after flooding incidents in the south-west over the weekend. \n\nTwenty homes were flooded in Miltown Malbay in Co Clare. Fire crews rescued a couple trapped in their car in the coastal village of Liscannor, also in Clare, with the county council forced to issue a travel warning to other motorists. \n\n"It is like someone picked up our house and dropped it into the path of a river, I've never seen the like of it," said Liscannor resident Grainne Flannery. \n\n"We're used to water coming in from the sea but not down from the hills. It was so strange to see. Sandbags would have been useless because the water was coming from everywhere." \n\nIn Ballyvourney, Co Cork, gardai closed roads as flood waters turned to rivers. \n\nIn Cork city last night, residents of areas hit by flood waters were taking no chances as they deployed sandbags to protect their homes. \n\nThe rainfall at the weekend was exceptional, said Irish Weather Online's Fergal Tierney. \n\n"At least two trillion litres of rain fell on Ireland on Friday and Saturday," he said. \n\n"I took the average rainfall over the 26 synoptic stations - 23.6 mm. However, mountainous regions will have received several times this value, except there are no stations up there to record it. \n\n"It's a lot of water, whichever way you look at it. It's enough to fill almost 800,000 Olympic swimming pools." \n\nBut the same counties which were pounded by heavy rain on Friday and Saturday were at the centre of the new alerts last night, as more heavy rain hit the west and south-west. \n\n"We can expect heavy rain and thundery downpours with the possibility of localised flooding, particularly in the west and south-west," said Met Eireann forecaster Evelyn Cusack. \n\n"While the south-west and west will receive the brunt of the bad weather, the north and north-west will be mainly dry and bright, with just a few scattered showers." \n\nThe weather is expected to settle later today and remain mainly bright and dry tomorrow. But a new low-pressure front could bring very heavy rain to the east and south-east of the country on Wednesday. \n\n"There is a risk of another spell of heavy rain in parts of the south and east as another frontal depression tracks near Ireland," said Cusack. \n\n"It will be cool and breezy, with highest temperatures of only 12C to 15C in fresh to strong north-easterly winds." \n\nThursday and Friday will be bright, blustery days with sunny spells and good drying, alongside passing heavy showers. \n\nOnline Editors \n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Livefyre. \n\nGrieving Irish mum keeps promise to dying son (26) with Australian trip in his honour \n\nStephanie Bell A grieving Irish mum has flown thousands of miles on a poignant pilgrimage to keep a promise to her dying son to mark his 26th birthday in the spot where he had dreamt of starting a new life. \n\nMum of feared criminal Alan Wilson found dead at home \n\nKen Foy The 63-year-old mother of one of Ireland's most feared gangland criminals has been found dead in her home in Dublin's south inner city. \n\nDonations flood in to cover funeral expenses of Temple Bar one-punch attack victim Gareth... \n\nLaura Larkin Donations have flooded in for the family of a Dublin man killed in a one-punch attack, following a fundraising appeal to help pay for his funeral.
8914672b-8d38-49f2-8fd4-e2eeb04ef31a	SHERIDAN — The Sheridan College rodeo team had mixed results over the weekend at the Chadron State College rodeo in Chadron, Nebraska. \n \nThe Sheridan women placed fourth at the rodeo with 190 points. \n \nCallie Robinson made it to the short round in both breakaway roping and barrel racing. \n \nRobinson split fourth and fifth with a 2.5-second score in breakaway roping’s long go. Her 4.0-second short round earned her third place and put her second in the average for a toal of 115 points. In barrel racing, Robinson finished with a time of 17.05 seconds but hit a barrel in the short round. \n \nCalby Hanson scored a 7.6 in goat tying to split fifth and sixth and earn a trip to the short round. She matched her long-go time with another 7.6-second run, earning her a fourth-place finish in the short round and fourth in the average. \n \nThe Lady Generals competed well and had a few other athletes just miss out on making the short round. \n Kaylee Reimler guides her horse around a barrel during last season’s Sheridan College Rodeo at the Sheridan County Fairgrounds. The Sheridan College rodeo team will host the Pat Hamilton Memorial Rodeo this weekend at the fairgrounds. \nFile Photo | The Sheridan Press \nBreanna Reimler missed the short round in breakaway roping by a tenth of a second, and Savanna Bolich and Kaylee Reimler just missed the short round in breakaway, as well. \n \nThe Sheridan men couldn’t string together as many successful rides over the weekend, but there were a couple bright spots for head coach Marc Gilkerson. \n \nFreshman Sam Thurston, who just started riding broncs this past summer, won the long round in saddle bronc riding with a 66-point score. He wasn’t able to score in the short round. \n \n“He is doing quite well considering he just started riding broncs this past summer,” Gilkerson said. “What he lacks in experience he makes up for with try.” \n \nKash Deal also made the short round in saddle bronc riding with a 52-point ride, but he wasn’t able to score in the short round, placing him fifth in the average. \n \nWeston Hartman brought the crowd to its feet in the bull riding. After being bucked from the bull three times, he managed to pull off a 72-point ride to place fourth and fifth in the long round. \n \nHe too, though, was unable to score in the short round. \n \nThe Sheridan College Rodeo team members will look to get on the right track this weekend when they host the Pat Hamilton Memorial Rodeo at the Sheridan County Fairgrounds. \n The following two tabs change content below.

04c84f3f-4c1e-43d2-a7e4-7cfd1833f148	WASHINGTON -- With a presidential debate and a contentious appearance in Congress coming, Hillary Rodham Clinton faces an October full of opportunity and risk for her presidential campaign. \n \nThe former secretary of state has spent months watching her poll numbers sink in crucial early voting states and faced endless questions about her email practices at the State Department. \n \nThe first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas and her congressional testimony before a Republican-led panel investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will give Clinton a big platform to make the case for her candidacy and challenge her Republican critics. \n \nThese events, of course, are equally a platform for opponents to try to weaken her. \n \nAlso in October, Clinton's campaign will disclose details about its fundraising and expenditures. The full Democratic field will appear at the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, which was a turning point for Barack Obama in his upstart bid against Clinton in the fall of 2007. \n \nThe most pivotal development could come from Vice President Joe Biden. His potential entry into the Democratic field could shake up the race and offer the party another alternative to Clinton, along with her chief rival now, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \n \nA preview of Clinton's October: \n \n__ \n \nBIDEN \n \nWill he or won't he? \n \nBiden's decision could have major ramifications for Clinton's standing in the primaries. If the vice president runs, he would give wary Democrats an excuse to abandon Clinton, even though she has locked up lots of congressional endorsements and financial donors. If Biden stays out, Clinton would campaign from a stronger position and could further make the case that she is the most electable Democrat against Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and others. Biden has said he is unsure whether he and his family will have the "emotional energy" for a campaign so soon after the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden. But his appearances around the country have turned into a parlor game for political insiders, creating a distraction for Clinton as she tries to consolidate support. \n \n__ \n \nFUNDRAISING \n \nClinton raised $47.5 million after launching her campaign in April. Her next fundraising report will show how she fared during the typical summer lull and give insiders a look into how efficiently her campaign is running. Clinton's team has built a massive operation at its Brooklyn, New York, headquarters and has hired dozens of field organizers in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where it has been spending about $400,000 a week on television advertising. Sanders is running a much leaner operation, and most of his $15.2 million haul in his first report came from donors giving $200 or less. Any signs that Clinton's fundraising edge is dwindling or she is burning through cash would set off more alarm bells in the party. \n \n__ \n \nFIRST DEBATE \n \nThe Oct. 13 debate in Nevada will give voters their first opportunity to measure Clinton on stage against Sanders and the rest of the field. Clinton has avoided directly criticizing Sanders' policy positions or his role in the primaries but her campaign has indicated voters may soon see a contrast between the two candidates. Clinton needs to tread carefully because she will need Sanders' supporters to help her campaign if she wins the nomination. Millions of people have tuned into the first two Republican debates, raising the potential stakes for Democrats. \n \nThere could be an element of surprise: CNN will allow Biden to participate even if he decides to become a candidate in the hours before the debate. Clinton's team sees debates as a strong suit for her. But observers remember her struggles, in an October 2007 debate, to answer a question about whether immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be issued driver's licenses. \n \n__ \n \nBENGHAZI TESTIMONY \n \nFor months, Clinton has tried to provide public testimony before the panel investigating her response to the Benghazi attack while she was President Obama's top diplomat. She will get that opportunity Oct. 22.  Supporters hope for a reprise of her fiery January 2013 appearance before lawmakers. Clinton's advisers view the October testimony as a chance for her to take on her Republican critics and predict some GOP lawmakers will overreach to the point of bullying her - imagery that could make the inquiry look like a political vendetta and boost her campaign. Still, the appearance could bring more attention to her use of a private email address and server and to questions about whether she exchanged classified information at the time. \n \n__ \n \nTHE J-J \n \nIf Clinton hopes to project strength in Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner is the place to do it. The Oct. 24 dinner typically draws thousands of hardcore Democratic activists. It's where eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry took on Howard Dean in the fall of 2003, and where Obama electrified Democrats in 2007. Some of Clinton's stronger moments during this campaign have come at large party events such as her speech before the New Hampshire state party convention, her address to the Democratic National Committee in Minneapolis and her "Wing Ding" speech in Iowa, when she railed against Republicans playing "partisan games." Clinton's 2007 appearance at the dinner fell flat next to Obama's. How she stacks up in the hall against Sanders and potentially Biden could set the tone for the remainder of the Iowa campaign. \n \n__ \n \nFollow Ken Thomas and Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/kthomasdc and http://twitter.com/llerer \n \n__ \n \nThis story has been corrected to show that Beau Biden was 46, not 47, when he died.

3ed0333e-f2ae-48bf-82ac-78def824674c	I am increasingly finding myself far more disinterested in the current reforms of the beer distribution system in Ontario than I am annoyed by them - but last week there were a couple of hints as to what is going on behind the closed process of government and industry negotiations that are worth noting if only for their entertainment value: = First, last Thursday Ben Johnson posted a great interview with the provincial Finance Minister in which he learned "the LCBO will roll out “craft beer zones” to 25 other LCBO locations across Ontario. Similar to the LCBO vintages section, these craft beer zones will feature and highlight craft beer made in Ontario." It would be similar if there weren't more than 300 Vintages locations in Ontario. Oddly, 20 years ago, the vintages section carried good beer, mainly imports but some local micros, too.\n= Second, Toronto's Metro confirmed that there will be annual limits to the works out to the equivalent of 279 six-packs — or about 70 cases of beer — sold daily per store... and also "unspecified penalties for retailers who try to sell more than their allocation"!! I think I mentioned this before but it's nice to see that it was not just my bad math. So... what does this mean? On a hot Friday in late July does the grocer cut off sales at 2 pm because the daily, weekly or monthly quota was reached?\nThese weird revelations are in addition to the numbers we have so far that indicate my city of 122,000 people will be lucky to get two of the new grocery store permits. More weirdness that remind me of something I came across some years ago now. Amongst my cult classic publications, I contributed the chapter "Beer and Autonomy" to the book Beer & Philosophy published in 2007. I opened the chapter with a quote from Pete Brown: "more than climate or genetics or anything else, drinking behaviours is governed by culture. And that culture is created by the laws that govern it." Looking at that now I that quibble with one word. Created. I would think now that the culture is expressed by the laws that govern it. I concluded the chapter with the thought that the beer laws of Canada ought to lead one to question the vision the state has of its own citizenry.\nThe more I write about Ontario in particular I now might question the vision the citizenry has of itself. These "reforms" are, yes, a bit more than shuffling the deck chairs but are so restricted that they must be messaging something related to cultural identity. Jordan has expressed measured optimism but I can't shake the feeling that we are dealing with a set of business and political interests that, in the words of one economic development officer spoken years ago in another province, is based on the principle "we pick the winners." Because the marketplace can't be trusted to pick the right winners. Because Ontarians can't be trusted and may not even trust themselves.
