33066a53-a0a7-416e-af6b-ee5fd2196370	PHILIP BROWN/ REUTERS    \nFast bowler Shahadat Hossain has played 38 tests and 51 ODIs for Bangladesh. \n             \nBangladesh police say national cricketer Shahadat Hossain and his wife Nritto Shahadat have gone into hiding over claims they beat their 11-year-old maid. \n \nPolice have stepped up the hunt for the 29-year-old bowler and say his phone is now being tracked amid an investigation into the alleged torture and abuse of the young maid. \n \n"We've mobilised ten mobile teams [of officers] to arrest him," Inspector Shafiqur Rahman told news agency AFP, adding that police were hopeful of arresting the couple soon. \n \n"We're making raids almost every day and are now tracking mobile phones." \n \nThey could face charges of child repression and employing a minor. \n \nAFP reports that the maid, Mahfuza Akter Happy, was found injured on the streets of Dhaka, and told police and local media that the couple beat her. Television footage showed her looking frail and thin, being taken to hospital with swollen black eyes. \n \n"She told us that the couple beat her very often. Her hand was charred with a hot cooking paddle. She had injury marks all over her body," Rahman has said. \n \nShe is being treated at a hospital in Dhaka. \n \nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has suspended Hossain from all forms of cricket until the case is resolved. \n \n"Unless the investigation ends or there is a decision on the matter, BCB doesn't want to keep any attachment with him," ESPNcricinfo quoted BCB president Nazmul Hassan as saying. \n \n"We are quiet, and we will remain quiet. He is more than likely to stay outside cricket. \n \n"There is no reason to give Shahadat Hossain any leeway, it is quite clear. I don't know whether you know this, but he came to see me. I didn't meet him. What would I have told him? I don't have anything to do. It is totally up to the law of the land." \n \nThis effectively rules him out of next month's two tests against Australia, though he had injured his ankle in a test match in May and may not have played anyway. \n \nHossain has played 38 tests and 51 one-day internationals for Bangladesh. \n    \n- Sydney Morning Herald
7265e155-7e1e-4bcb-939f-0fe6d56a42d4	News Release — Old Stone House Museum \nSept. 22, 2015 \n \nContact: \nPeggy Day Gibson, Executive Director \nOld Stone House Museum \n director@oldstonehousemuseum.org \n802-754-2022 \n \nAlexander Twilight Revealed Through His Sermons \nProfessor Lawrence Hundersmarck Speaks \nAt the Old Stone House Museum, Brownington \nSunday, September 27 at 3 pm \n \nBrownington, VT—The Old Stone House Museum is pleased to announce that Lawrence Hundersmarck, professor of religion and philosophy at Pace University in New York and seasonal resident of Barton, Vermont, will speak on the mind and values of Alexander Twilight as revealed through his sermons on Sunday, September 27 at 3 pm in the Brownington Church, Brownington, Vermont. His talk immediately follows the Museum’s popular Apple and Cheese Tasting and is free and open to the public. All are welcome to attend. \n \nAbout the Talk: Alexander Twilight Revealed will focus on the ideas and values of Alexander Twilight as revealed in an important primary source now preserved in Old Stone House Museum’s archival vault—a collection of 20 sermons in manuscript, hand-written ink by Twilight and hand-sewn into small booklets. Composed toward the end of Twilight’s life, these manuscripts are notes for sermons preached throughout Northern Vermont: in Brownington, Barton Orleans (called then Barton Landing), and Derby. Until 2003, these texts were unknown, but emerged from the archives of the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul, as part of their holdings on Dr. James Woodward Strong (1833-1913), former president of Carlton College, who was born in Brownington and studied under Twilight at the Grammar School in 1841. The Old Stone House Museum now holds these documents and makes them available for scholarly study. \n \nAbout Alexander Twilight: Alexander Lucius Twilight (1795-1857) was principal of the Orleans County Grammar School and preached in the Brownington Church, beginning in 1829. Historical records portray Twilight as a devoted, strong willed, talented educator and preacher, whose skills earned him both the respect and esteem of his students. One of his main accomplishments was construction of the 4-story, granite school dormitory between 1834-36, known as the “Old Stone House.” Twilight was the first African American attendee of any college in the United States, graduating from Middlebury College in 1823. He was also the first American of mixed race to serve as a representative to Vermont’s State Legislature in Montpelier in 1836. Twilight is buried along with his wife Mercy Ladd Twilight in the church yard next to the Brownington Church where the talk will be held. \n \nAbout Laurence Hundersmarck: Professor Lawrence F. Hundersmarck teaches religion and philosophy at Pace University in New York and is also a seasonal resident in Barton, Vermont. He is author of numerous articles on the Renaissance and the Middle Ages, Eastern literature, and great thinkers of the Eastern and Western worlds. \n \nAbout the Old Stone House Museum: Established and run by the Orleans County Historical Society, the Old Stone House Museum is an historic neighborhood and museum whose mission is to educate the public through exhibitions, programs and classes that bring history to life. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, it encompasses six restored buildings and three neighboring structures dating from the first half of the 19th century. These include the Federalist homes of Reverend Alexander Twilight, first African American graduate of Middlebury College, progressive educator, and state legislator; and the first teacher educator Samuel Read Hall, who invented the chalkboard. It is also the site of the “Old Stone House,” a four-story granite dormitory built by Twilight in 1836 to house students attending the Orleans County Grammar School. \n \nGeneral Information: For more information about Orleans County Historical Society’s Old Stone House Museum please visit www.oldstonehousemuseum.org  or call 802-754-2022. The Old Stone House Museum is located at 109 Old Stone House Road, Brownington, Vermont 05860. The Old Stone House Museum is open from May 15-October 15.

441c233d-7dcd-47cd-bcd1-bef777497fce	NEW YORK  — The West Indian Day Parade is underway in New York City, but it's already been marred by violence. \n\nOne man was stabbed to death early Monday in Brooklyn, and others were wounded by gunfire. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says a man critically injured by a random bullet to the head is a Harvard-educated lawyer who works for the Empire State Development Corporation. \n\nThe raucous parade celebrating Caribbean culture features outlandish costumes, indigenous foods, loud music and scores of dancers. \n\nIt's also a significant political moment. Elected officials from across the city attended a breakfast before marching. \n\nThe festivities are expected to be the first time since July that Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio attend the same public event. The two have been engaged in a monthslong feud.
6f06243e-cc4f-4627-b6b9-cccccf33213e	© . David Jordan, a member of Chirst Fellowship in North Carolina, preaches in support of the prayer rally at the Carter County Detention Center for Rowan County clerk Kim Davis in Grayson \n\n(Reuters) - The lawyer for a Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses said on Sunday he filed a notice of appeal over a contempt ruling that landed her in jail. \n\nRowan County Clerk Kim Davis was jailed last week for refusing to follow the orders of U.S. District Judge David Bunning. Davis had refused to issue the licenses, saying doing so would run counter to her deeply held Christian beliefs. \n\n"The contempt order itself was unlawful," Roger Gannam, a lawyer for Davis, told Reuters. Gannam is an attorney with Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based Christian religious advocacy organization that said it would back her legally. \n\nThe notice of appeal was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and lays a path for an appeal. \n\nIn Davis's absence, on Friday, deputy clerks issued marriage licenses to at least four same-sex couples at the offices in Morehead, Kentucky, where rival groups of demonstrators supporting Davis and the applicants protested outside. \n\nBunning had ordered Davis in August to issue the licenses. Her request for a stay of his order was denied by a U.S. appeals court and by the U.S. Supreme Court.

75c070fd-e315-4e78-a922-cdff0c330eff	(CNN) -  \nA presidential debate in 2015 is only half the battle. The reaction on social media can also tell the tale of who did great and who flopped the debate. \n\nCNN's Republican presidential debate on Wednesday night was no different. \n\nHere are six of the biggest social media moments: \n\nCarly Fiorina takes on Donald Trump's remarks \n\nCarly Fiorina once again showed herself willing and able to go toe to toe with the leading candidates, taking Donald Trump to task for earlier comments he made about her. \n\nA Rolling Stone article quoted Trump as saying, "Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?" \n\nFiorina confronted him about those remarks on the debate stage in Simi Valley, California. \n\nIt was the most tweeted moment from the debate. \n\nBush admits to smoking marijuana \n\nIt wasn't exactly an "I didn't inhale" moment, but still quite the admission from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. And he had an apology that his team tweeted right after. \n\nThe many faces of "The Donald" \n\nDonald Trump, per usual, said a lot during the debate, but the faces he made throughout told the tale. \n\nBush demands Trump apologize \n\nBush and Trump had several moments going head-to-head, most notably when the former governor wanted Trump to apologize for remarks he made about his wife, Columba Bush, in a deleted tweet: "#JebBush has to like the Mexican Illegals because of his wife." Trump wasn't about to apologize, and Columba responded. \n\nCarly Fiorina's Planned Parenthood moment \n\nThe audience erupted in applause after Carly Fiorina made mention of the recent hidden camera videos targeting Planned Parenthood. \n\nThis moment ranked 2nd on Facebook for the night. \n\nBush vs. Trump on the most recent Bush president \n\nTrump laid into former president George W. Bush, and the younger Bush defended his brother's record. \n\nSomething that didn't take place on the debate stage \n\nA few people on social media were distracted from the actual debate, wondering who the young man was sitting behind Jake Tapper. \n\nEven Buzzfeed got into the act, posting a story about him. \n\nWell, CNN got in touch with him and his name is Greg Caruso of Los Angeles, an aspiring filmmaker who is not on Facebook or Twitter (and sorry, he declined to disclose his relationship status). \n\nHe first found out about the attention he was getting via texts from his friends and finds the whole thing to be funny. \n\n"It's pretty hilarious," he said. "Social media can focus on some guy at the debate instead of the debate."

I'm not one of these guys who wants to go colonise mars in the first wave of people. \n \n\n                            \n"I think we have to get off the planet so we can protect the species from one extinction level event." \n \n\n                            \nIn 'The Martian', the 44-year-old actor - who raises daughters Alexia, 16, Isabella, nine, Gia, seven, and Stella, four, with wife Luciana - plays an astronaut who gets left behind on Mars alone, and he had to spend five weeks shooting with no other actors on set. \n \n\n                            \nAnd Matt admitted he would love to get a little bit more alone time in his personal life. \n \n\n                            \nHe laughed to 'Entertainment Tonight Canada': "I love being with my kids but you can attest to the fact that you would take a day alone now or then if you could get it. \n \n\n                            \n"I wouldn't want to be alone for more than a day or two..I think a day would be good. You kind of re-set , re-charge."
7c4b0e4b-e481-4902-a6d8-979193ccede0	Single mother and businesswoman Sussanne Khan criticized the gossip mongers and denied the reports of her wedding with actor Arjun Rampal. The former wife of Hrithik Roshan added that such a gossip can hurt as it involves families and human emotions. \nSussanne released a statement which said, “Persistent speculation in the media has made me realise that idle Bollywood gossip mongers, who are influential, are insistent on spreading rumours and lies about me.” The statement added that stories were fabricated about her upcoming wedding with Rampal and meetings at the coffee shop. \nThe interior designer slammed the press for posting such irresponsible and stories and added, “I am a single working mother and take tremendous pride in the way I live.” Recent rumours had claimed that close friend Arjun Rampal had come close to Sussanne and that they were soon going to tie the knot. \nKhan has earlier clarified that Arjun was not the reason behind her split with Hrithik and that nobody was to be blamed for it. Hrithik and Sussanne got married in 2000 and have two sons Hrehaan and Hridaan. The couple put an end to their relationship in December 2013 just a few days before their wedding anniversary. \n \nPhoto Credits: Viral Bhayani \n \nThe post Sussanne Khan irked by media spreading false rumours appeared first on Bollywood Garam .
20c6734e-339d-4ac1-a608-ab6d590060af	Lr Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, of the Fox Lake, Illinois police, was shot dead Tuesday morning The suspects in the shooting have been described as three men - two white and one black  Law enforcement scoured the area where the officer's body was found on Tuesday, but did not find the men The search for the suspects continued overnight Tuesday into early Wednesday morning    \nAs a small northern Illinois community mourned a popular veteran police officer who was fatally shot while on duty, authorities scoured the area overnight in search of three men wanted in his slaying. \n\nHelicopters were to aid about 100 officers early Wednesday as the manhunt in and around the village of Fox Lake for the suspects the fatal shooting of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz stretched toward a second day, a sheriff's office spokesman said. \n\nAuthorities from across the state and region poured into the village about 60 miles north of Chicago after the shooting Tuesday morning, some wearing tactical gear and toting high-powered rifles. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the search for the suspects, Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said.  \n\n   \n   \nThe search for three men who allegedly shot dead a police officer in Fox Lake, Illinois on Tuesday continued over night.

''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.' \n\nThe area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. \n\nAuthorities urged residents throughout the area to stay home while they conducted the search for three men, two of them white and the other black, aided by the canines and helicopters. \n\nThe service of a local commuter train was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay in their homes — with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. \n   \nA manhunt is underway in a Chicago suburb after a police officer was reportedly shot dead while on a routine patrol.

And on Wednesday, seven area schools canceled classes, Covelli said. \n\nGliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. \n\nAround Fox Lake, residents expressed their own sorrow over the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. \n\n'This particular officer is a pillar in my community and definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,' said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher who lives in the community. \n\nDozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. \n\nThirty-year-old Dan Raminick held a sign that said 'Police Lives Matter.'

0fd8887d-9134-427b-8594-0b0be0e17c97	7:27 p.m. EDT \n \nCANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian prime minister elect Malcolm Turnbull promised to focus on improving the country's faltering economy as the public woke up on Tuesday to its fourth leader in two years. \n \nThe ruling Liberal Party voted to oust Tony Abbott as prime minister in favor of Turnbull, a multi-millionaire former tech entrepreneur who is hugely popular with the electorate, in a secret ballot late on Monday. \n \n"I'm filled with optimism and we will be setting out in the weeks ahead ... more of those foundations that will ensure our prosperity in the years ahead," Turnbull told reporters as he headed to parliament on Tuesday. \n \nAbbott was deposed following months of opinion polls that showed his popularity with the public near rock bottom as Australia's $1.5 trillion economy struggles to cope with the end of a once-in-a-century mining boom. \n \nTurnbull, toppled as leader of the conservative Liberal Party by Abbott in 2009, has consistently been seen as a preferred prime minister. However, his support for a carbon trading scheme, gay marriage and an Australian republic have made him unpopular with his party's right wing. \n \nTurnbull is widely expected to overhaul the cabinet, with current Treasurer Joe Hockey, who has been battling a backlash against a deeply unpopular budget, likely to be replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison. \n \nDefense Minister Kevin Andrews, who is overseeing a A$50 billion ($35.70 billion) submarine tender, is also expected to be replaced when Turnbull unveils his ministry later this week. \n \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop, who won the party room vote to retain her additional position as deputy prime minister, said she had spoken with international leaders overnight about the leadership change. \n \nThe opposition Labor Party was quick to label Turnbull a "multi-millionaire who lives in a pink mansion on Sydney Harbour" who was out of touch with everyday Australians. \n \nThe change of leaders is the latest sign of political instability in Australia, which has in recent years been convulsed by backroom machinations and party coups that have shaken public and business confidence in government. \n \nLabor's Kevin Rudd, elected prime minister with a strong mandate in 2007, was deposed by his deputy, Julia Gillard, in 2010 amid the same sort of poll numbers that Abbott faced. Gillard was in turn deposed by Rudd ahead of elections won by Abbott in 2013. \n \n($1 = 1.4006 Australian dollars) \n \n(Reporting by Jane Wardell; Editing by Dean Yates)
d8ed88e3-d9a7-46be-9dc0-28cbf84667b4	An arthritis diagnosis increases the risk of falling into poverty, according to an Australian study. \n \nArthritis is a very debilitating disease and likely impacts labor force participation, either forcing people to retire early due to the pain or physical restriction of arthritis, reducing the hours they can work or changing to a lower-paid job, said lead author Emily Callander, a research fellow at the University of Sydney. \n \n"For those who are already in retirement it may be that the costs of treatment or costs of accessing aids or career services have required them to draw down some of their assets, which would lower the income they derive from their assets," Callander told Reuters Health by email. \n \nThe researchers studied more than 4,000 Australian adults between 2007 and 2012. \n \nAt the start of the study, the participants were not in poverty and did not have arthritis. By 2009, 300 of the participants had developed arthritis, half of whom were men. Over the study, 18 percent of women and 16 percent of men fell into poverty based on income, and the proportion in poverty increased with age. \n \nWomen who developed arthritis were 51 percent more likely to fall into income poverty than nonarthritic women. For men, arthritis increased the risk by 22 percent. \n \nWomen were also more likely to fall into poverty by a definition encompassing income, health and education attainment, or "multidimensional poverty," according to the results in Arthritis and Rheumatology. \n \n"It is known that people with lower incomes are more likely to develop arthritis, but this is the first study to show the inverse relationship - that arthritis could also lead to income poverty," Callander said. \n \nWomen are more likely than men to have severe arthritis, which may make it harder for them to work, but that dimension was not included in this study, she noted. \n \n"In our analysis we did take into consideration other factors, such as age, being married or in a de facto relationship as opposed to being single, being a home owner as opposed to renting or having a mortgage, and whether the person lived in a major city, an inner regional area or a rural area," she said. "However, even after considering all these other factors, being diagnosed with arthritis still leads to an increased risk of poverty." \n \nBut the study did not account for other health issues, including obesity, which increases the risk for arthritis and is more common among people with lower socioeconomic status, said Dr. Gillian Hawker, chair of Medicine at the University of Toronto, who was not involved in the research. \n \n"Poverty is associated with poor diet and less opportunity for physical activity which increases the risk for obesity and in turn for osteoarthritis," Hawker told Reuters Health by email. \n \nWe should first address the common risk factors, particularly obesity, and ensure that all people with arthritis have access to surgical and non-surgical treatment, she said. \n \nPreventing arthritis would reduce the health burden as well as the economic burden, but as the population ages in many countries, arthritis will continue to become more common, so it will also be important to help those with the condition remain in the workforce, Callander said. \n \n"We know, for example, that workplace modifications may help people remain in employment, so encouraging employees and employers to look at these options would be a great start," she said. \n \n"One of the most important considerations should be that any arthritis interventions - be it treatment or prevention - should be equally effective in both low and high income patients, this will ensure that our health interventions do not widen inequality gaps," she said. "Furthermore, when treating arthritis patients, health professionals should be aware of this greater risk of income poverty, and consider a patient's ability to pay for any out of pocket costs when determining considering treatment options and devising treatment plans." \n \nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1USRI6C Arthritis and Rheumatology, online September 8, 2
c60c7a34-173f-4ab1-9d66-0abdc667ff9b	IMDb\nA football player and his friends travel to the planet Mongo and find themselves fighting the tyranny of Ming the Merciless to save Earth.\nRogerEbert\nNot since "Infra-Man" has a movie opened with a development more ominous than the crisis facing Earth at the beginning of "Flash Gordon." But Earth scientists are playing it cool: A NASA spokesman denies that there's anything unusual about an unexpected total eclipse of the sun. Unusual? That the moon is out of its orbit? Ha! It takes a mad scientist like Dr. Hans Zarkov to realize that the Earth is under attack, and speed to the rescue in his private space ship-with Flash Gordon and Dale Arden aboard as unwilling passengers.\nIf memory serves, this is more or less the same beginning as in the original movie serialization of "Flash Gordon," back in 1936. Even if it's not, this new Dino De Laurentiis production is true to the tacky pop origins of the Flash Gordon comic strip and the serials starring Buster Crabbe. At a time when "Star Wars" and its spin-offs have inspired special effects men to bust a gut making their interplanetary adventures look real, "Flash Gordon" is cheerfully willing to look as phony as it is. I DON'T mean that as a criticism. You can make a city float in the clouds and look marginally realistic (as in "The Empire Strikes Back"), but there's something sort of fun about the "Flash Gordon" city that floats in the clouds and looks like a large miniature model floating in fake clouds. And as the spaceships lumber past on the screen, I really wouldn't have minded if they'd left a tube of model airplane glue lying in the lower left-hand corner. "Flash Gordon" is played for laughs, and wisely so. It is no more sophisticated than the comic strip it's based on, and that takes the curse off of material that was old before it was born. This is space opera, a genre invented by Edgar Rice Burroughs and Hugo Gernsback and other men of unlimited imagination harnessed to definitely limited skills. It's fun to see it done with energy and love and without the pseudo-meaningful apparatus of the Force and Trekkie Power. The plot is simple: The Emperor Ming (Max von Sydow), bored with life in the universe, decides to pick on Earth. After warming up with a few hurricanes and earthquakes, he sends the moon spinning down toward the planet. Meanwhile, Zarkov, Flash (Sam J. Jones, last seen as Bo Derek's husband in "10") and Dale (Melody Anderson) crash-land in Ming's imperial space city. There are intrigues afoot, but meanwhile Dale catches Ming's eye, he determines to marry her, and Flash finds himself fighting for his life with a gladiator. Mike Hodges, the British director hired by De Laurentiis to orchestrate this comic space opera, is true to the visual tradition Of the, original serials: Everyone is dressed in capes and ridiculous boots and headdresses, and stand, around on the command decks of ornate space ships. There's an imperial court to applaud and boo at the appropriate times. And there's a cliff-hanging showdown when the Hawk Men, looking amazingly like the winged angels in De Laurentiis' production as "Barbarella" (1968), engage the crew of a space ship in hand-to-hand battle (you know there's something lacking with the Ming technology when the commander of the rocket ship shouts "Stand by to the repel invaders!"). Is all of this ridiculous? Of course. Is it fun? Yeah, sort of, it is. Rotten Tomatoes MOVIE INFO In this campy adventure movie, Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) of comic strip fame, struggles to save the world from the dastardly scheme of Emperor Ming the Merciless (Max vonSydow). The movie soundtrack was created by superstar rock group Queen Full Movie on Zumvo
d662b796-9e7d-4cdc-b02b-51f2b6b030e9	The series finale of "Key & Peele" took a trip to the magical land of "Negrotown." \n\nA musical spoof with a tune so catchy you'll want to sing it all day long at work -- but really, really shouldn't -- the "Negrotown" sketch was an apt way to send off a series that, in sketches like " Auction Block " and " Gun-Crazy Cop, " has provided scathingly funny and sadly relevant commentary on race relations in America. \n\nSIGN UP for the free Essential Arts & Culture newsletter >> \n\nIn the sketch (which was actually released online well ahead of its network airing Wednesday night), a character played by Keegan-Michael Key is about to be arrested by a white police officer for no apparent reason, when suddenly he is whisked away to Negrotown. \n\n"Negrotown? What? Like Atlanta?" Key asks his guide, played by Peele. \n \nNot exactly. Negrotown is a candy-colored Utopia for black people, where "you can walk the street without getting stopped harassed or beat" and "wear your hoodie and not get shot."  \n\nAlas, the place "where the strong black men are raining down" and "there's no disease, no sickle cell" is but a fantasy. Key's character wakes up from the beautifully choreographed dream to find himself being shoved into a police car.  \n\n"I thought I was going to Negrotown?" he says, bewildered. \n\n"Oh, you are," replies the police officer ominously. \n\n(You can watch the whole sketch here , but be warned: It includes lots of potentially offensive language.)  \n\nElsewhere in the series finale, we found out just why Key and Peele have been on the road for the last two seasons: They've been trying to get far enough away from their wives to safely use the word "bitch." It's a nice way to touch on another of this show's recurring themes, macho posturing, and is also, of course, a callback to a classic sketch from the pilot , which starred Key and Peele as married men trading tales of dominating their spouses -- but only when said wives were out of earshot. \n  \nRelations between the sexes figured prominently in the hour-long episode, which also featured the almost-breakup of Meegan and Andre, the world's most poisonous relationship. Meegan, she of the creaky voice and pancake makeup, once again proved herself to be a master of passive-aggressive manipulation, luring dim-witted Andre back into the relationship against his will. \n \nThere was also room in the finale for some of the pop culture-inspired silliness that "Key & Peele" does every bit as well as the hot-button subjects.  Peele starred in a spoof ad for a compilation of would-be "major motion picture themes" by Ray Parker Jr., of "Ghostbusters" fame. The album includes songs for movies as "12 Years a Slave" (sample lyrics: "Who's a slave? I'm not a slave!") but not, it should be noted, "Ghostbusters." You've been warned. \n\nThere was even a bit reflecting on the legacy of "Key & Peele," which Peele claimed, somewhat facetiously, was “the greatest comedy or otherwise show ever made," and ranked alongside "Dallas" and "The Twilight Zone" as one of the all-time greats (what, no "Breaking Bad"?). \n\n"I think that it’s very possible, like, we’ll go down like the Wright Brothers," he said, catching himself. "Am I going too far? Am I overblowing it?” \n\nMaybe a skosh, but it's certainly been nooice  having them around. \n\nFollow @MeredithBlake on Twitter. \n\nMORE: \n\nStephen Colbert gets raw with 'supervillain' Tesla founder Elon Musk \n\nMarvel gives 'Jessica Jones' a release date and her first teaser trailer \n\nHere's why the outrageously important 'Key & Peele' is comedy's jam \n  \n Copyright © 2015, Orlando Sentinel
ce864f86-6410-47eb-9453-460f7397e382	  Statement by the President Commemorating the Twentieth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women I am proud to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.  Today we recommit ourselves to the basic principle affirmed there, namely that “[w]omen's empowerment and their full participation on the basis of equality in all spheres of society, including participation in the decision-making process and access to power, are fundamental for the achievement of equality, development and peace.”  The United States understands that women's rights are human rights, and that empowered women and educated girls are critical to achieving lasting peace, security, and prosperity.  Over the last 20 years we have made tremendous strides toward gender equality:  We have worked with Congress to reauthorize the groundbreaking Violence Against Women Act--enacting new protections and strengthening existing protections, including for LGBT individuals and Native American survivors of domestic violence.   Through the Affordable Care Act, we have dramatically increased access to quality, affordable health care for women and girls across the United States and put an end to women being charged more for healthcare than men. With our National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security and by chairing the Equal Futures Partnership, we are encouraging and supporting women’s economic and political empowerment both at home and abroad.   Within the United States, we are taking steps to support working families, encourage women and girls to pursue careers in the STEM fields, and provide additional opportunities for women entrepreneurs. But we know that much work remains.  Women and girls continue to face violence and discrimination at home, at work, in school, and in their communities.  Women continue to be paid less than men for equal work.  In too many places around the world, girls do not have the same educational opportunities as boys.  Too often, women’s contributions are undervalued, under-utilized, and suppressed.  And in too many places -- from China to Egypt, from Russia to Venezuela -- women have been swept up in repressive crackdowns on civil society, and deprived of their universal rights and fundamental freedoms.  That’s why my administration continues to work to advance the empowerment and education of women and girls here and abroad.  It's why we are dedicating additional resources to address violence against women and girls.  It's why we are investing in job training and apprenticeships to help women earn better-paying jobs.  It is why we launched Let Girls Learn, to address the challenges adolescent girls around the world face in enrolling, completing and succeeding in school.  And it is why my Administration's Stand With Civil Society initiative is supporting the right of women and all people around the world to work peacefully for the betterment of their societies without fear that their rights and freedoms will be unjustly abridged. Today, we renew our resolve to work tirelessly toward a world where every woman and girl can enjoy the rights and freedoms that are her birthright. We pledge to continue this work in partnership with the independent civil society advocates and experts who have led the fight for women's empowerment, as envisioned when the international community convened 20 years ago.  And we remind ourselves of all of the noble promises of that conference, and rededicate ourselves to making them a reality.   Source: The White House, Office of the Press Secretary  
4936741d-3ad2-45e1-9384-80475ee03e1c	Set in the 1970s for no good reason except to showcase a few sideburns and groovy shirts, Cut Snake is a not-quite thriller, not-quite drama about a man with a past Merv (Alex Russell) whose idyllic new life engaged to Paula (Jessica DeGouw) is threatened by the sudden appearance of Jim “Pommie” Stuart (Sullivan Stapleton), a tough ex-con who wants to tempt Merv back into his old ways. The new film from Tony Ayres (Walking on Water, The Home Song Stories) has an impressively cracked and volatile star in Stapleton, who looks like he’d head butt you as soon as look at you, but low stakes, an anaemic storyline, and poorly drawn supporting characters. The film threatens to become interesting during a scene set in a drag club but backs shyly away from queer issues every time it raises them. Its title suggests a hint of madness: instead, it’s utterly conventional and lacking in fangs.

[PHOTO: WILLIS AWANDU/STANDARD] \n\nTeachers have until September 18 to return to work or risk being struck off the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) payroll. \n\nTSC Chairperson Lydia Nzomo said only teachers who have been performing their duties will be paid in full. Ms Nzomo said those who will regard the call before the deadline will also be paid but only for the days worked. \n\n"Teachers who will not have heeded the call will be removed from the payroll. Consequently, their salaries will be stopped and their names struck out of the TSC payroll," threatened Nzomo, who had earlier sounded a warning to teachers who have absconded duty that they will not earn their salaries. \n\nShe added that TSC county directors have submitted details of teachers who have been on duty since August 31. \n\nNzomo said at least 22 per cent of primary and 54 per cent of secondary schools are currently operational. "Most of these are school administrators who include principals, deputy principals and heads of departments in the case of secondary schools and head teachers, their deputies and senior teachers for primary schools," she said. \n\nThe commission still maintains that it does not have the resources to pay a monthly figure of Sh1.6 billion, saying they were only allocated Sh174 billion for the financial year 2015-2016 for teachers' salaries and allowances. \n\nSee also: Use CDF to pay teachers, Duale tells MPs \n\nThe Court of Appeal last month ordered the commission to pay the teachers a salary increase of between 50 and 60 per cent spread over four years. \n\nAs the teachers strike entered its third week yesterday, teachers unions maintained their stand saying they will only call it off once the Government implements the increment. \n\nFollowing President Uhuru Kenyatta's remarks that there is no money to pay the award, Kenya National Union of Teachers called on Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi and Nzomo to stop "giving the wrong advice to the President". \n\nDeputy President William Ruto also recently called on teachers to respect the position taken by the commission and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission's that there was no money to pay them. \n\nClick to Download full copy \n\nJudge dissolves sexless marriage after wife proves her virginity in court proceedings Impotence is perhaps one of the least spoken about challenges in marriage.

dd99c9cf-75f5-45de-b114-b45eb90305a2	As I announced a couple of days ago, today I’ll present a workflow that further increases the High-ISO range of Merrill and Quattro Foveon sensors when taking color pictures. In contrast to the blue channel workflow, which is able to improve noise performance in black-and-white images almost without any side-effects, this particular workflow is a compromise between resolution and noise. My aim is to reduce luminance and colored cloud noise that is typical of Foveon sensors as much as possible, without making the images look softer than those taken with comparable Bayer sensor cameras. However, I haven’t yet found a magical way to make noise in color images disappear completely. ;)

Krishnan \n\nTOPICS \n\n‘Swades’ versus ‘Srimanthudu’. And the idea of the socially relevant ‘mass’ movie. \n\nA few weeks ago, Mahesh Babu’s Srimanthudu had a subtitled release in Chennai. I must say it was a brave move. Not because it was a Telugu film — these Telugu ‘mass’ films (or wide-appeal masala movies) are practically identical to the ones in Tamil — but because it referred to Mahesh Babu as ‘Super Star.’ As we all know, there’s just one of those in these parts. But back to that ‘mass’ film business. Srimanthudu has all the expected formula elements. The hero introduction scene (during Ram Navami celebrations, where there’s pleasant confusion about who exactly is being deified)... The heroine entry scene (she’s in a salwar kameez, drawing a kolam/rangoli on the porch; in other words, she’s non-threatening desi arm candy)... The villain establishing shot (he brings down a log of wood on some poor man’s skull, and he’s so evil, he doesn’t stop there; he orders his men to throw this man on the road, so he can get crushed by a passing truck)... \n\nBut Srimanthudu is a little different from the usual mass movie, in that it has what the industry would call a ‘soft’ subject. It’s about a billionaire who doesn’t care for money, who’s not interested in taking over his father’s business. He keeps associating with the lower classes — at one point, he hands over lakhs of rupees for the wedding of an employee’s daughter. (We’re not meant to ask things like: Wouldn’t it be better if he said something against dowry and found the girl a groom who accepted her for what she is? This is about the hero’s heart, his big, golden heart.) And later, goaded by his girlfriend’s taunts, he adopts a village — he uses his wealth to build roads, schools, hospitals, and so on. So the film is a bit of Rudraveena (Unnal Mudiyum Thambi in Tamil), a bit of the Buddha’s life, a bit of Swades... \n\nIt’s the latter, mostly, that keeps coming to mind. This isn’t an exact comparison. You might say that there isn’t a single moment in Srimanthudu as powerful, as intimate as the one in Swades where the NRI protagonist buys non-bottled water from a little boy at a nondescript railway station. But then, that was a different kind of movie, the equivalent of a close-up — Srimanthudu, on the other hand, is a wide-angle shot. Swades devoted a lot of its running time to detail how this man changes this village, while in Srimanthudu, it all happens over the course of one song. But this isn’t about which is the better film. This is about how the same premise is treated in two modes of popular Indian filmmaking — a relatively ‘realistic’ mode (Swades) and an unapologetically larger-than-life mode (Srimanthudu). So Swades has a protagonist, while Srimanthudu has a hero — one who has to perform periodic goon-bashing duties in order to remind the mass audience that despite his do-gooding impulses he can be a badass. \n\nIs there another country where there’s such tonal variety in mainstream cinema? Elsewhere, you have popular cinema (released in large numbers of theatres all at once, and aiming to make tons of money from all audiences) and art cinema (released in a few theatres, for a select audience) — but here, even the popular cinema can go the way of a Srimanthudu or a Swades. What’s more interesting, the line between art cinema and popular cinema has begun to blur in at least one respect. Once upon a time, the mass films were mainly about power struggles — so you had the village-based films where the hero was a lowly farmer and the villain a zamindar, or the city-based films where the hero was a lowly clerk and the villain a politician or gangster. But in the past few years, mass films (at least the ones in Tamil and Telugu) have begun to look at the kind of ‘socially relevant’ issues usually relegated to documentaries and art-house cinema. \n\nSrimanthudu hints at how private enterprise can play a part in the rehabilitation of underdeveloped villages. The Vijay blockbuster Kaththi brought into focus farmer suicides and the role played by multinationals in depleting water resources. Ajith’s Yennai Arindhaal had a subplot about organ trafficking and Sivakarthikeyan’s Kakki Sattai talked about migrant workers. Seen one way, this is just lip service. These films are not really about any of these issues — complex realities are often dismissed with simplistic solutions, like taking an aspirin for cancer. \n\nOftentimes, it’s just that the directors are trying to avoid cliché, thinking up out-of-the-box villains for the hero to go up against. But look at it another way. Should we be happy that a medium that reaches millions is at least throwing these topical subjects into the conversation around a movie? \n\nOn a tangential note, I was happy Srimanthudu was released here. The point isn’t about the quality of the film, the “is it worth watching?” question. The point is that the regional films that end up in cities outside the ‘region’ of the film’s making are almost always pedigreed films — like the impressive Court (Marathi). But watching Court does not translate into watching ‘Marathi cinema’ — just like you’re not going to get an idea about French cinema in general by watching Godard. That’s not what the average French moviegoer sees, the commercial, mainstream stuff. These regular films are important too. What are we like as audience? What do we find socially or culturally acceptable enough to drag our families to? What kind of film do we open up our wallets for? These are important questions, and the best answers come from our mainstream movies. \n\nBaradwaj Rangan is The Hindu’s cinema critic. \n\nKeywords: Baradwaj Rangan, Screening Room column, 'mass' cinema, Swades, Srimanthudu

Let some American women take on the roles that you're getting, because Americans are watching your movies and lining your pockets!" \n \nBlunt has since responded to the controversy, insisting she meant no harm when she made the innocent remark. \n \nAddressing Kooiman's demands for her to leave Hollywood on Thursday, Blunt told Today, "It was so not the intention to hurt anybody or cause any offence so I really apologize to those that I caused offence (to). It was just an offhand joke."

62b18dbb-6fae-46e8-b720-046d1bf9371c	) - Bluewolf , a global consulting agency, has released its fourth annual The State of Salesforce Report that evaluates how companies use and capitalize on the promise of the world's #1 CRM platform. Based on insights from more than 1,500 Salesforce customers worldwide, the 2015-2016 report explores companies' focus on employee engagement and innovation as they position themselves for growth. \n\nDownload the full report here . \n   \nA third of companies cite employee-facing initiatives as one of their top objectives for 2016. In past years, companies have primarily focused on improving the customer experience to increase their bottom line. However, a focus only on the customer experience is an incomplete engagement approach. As customer expectations rise, so do employee expectations. Today's modern-day employee was raised in a digital environment, where constant connectivity and mobile access are an inherent part of their lives. Every day, they are exposed to apps and products that make their lives easier, and are less tolerant of business processes and technology that don't follow suit. \n\nAccording to the report, companies are three times more likely to attribute measureable business outcomes to the use of Salesforce when employees believe that Salesforce makes their jobs easier. The more engaged employees become, the more value they can provide to customers. \n\n"In today's customer-driven market, it's easy to overlook the employee experience. However, it is the very force that enables customer success," said Eric Berridge, CEO, Bluewolf. " The State of Salesforce Report shows that while innovation is essential to improving employee experiences, companies must combine it with data, design, and an employee culture willing to adopt it to see improvements across the entire organization." \n\nBluewolf's 2015-2016 The State of Salesforce Report uncovers several key trends tied to prioritizing employee engagement, including: \nKnow the customer, one cloud at a time - 64 percent of Salesforce customers plan to increase their Salesforce budgets in the coming year; 11 percent plan to increase spending by more than 50 percent. Additionally, 49 percent of customers are currently invested in two or more Salesforce clouds, and 22 percent of customers are invested in three or more Salesforce clouds. Turn Salesforce from chore to choice - 90 percent of companies say improving the user experience of sales apps is key to their sales strategy in the coming year. Furthermore, employees state that they are two times more likely to say Salesforce makes it easier to do their jobs when they can access it from a mobile device. Mobile-optimized tools and applications are critical to selling smarter and faster with Sales Cloud, and supporting intelligent, relevant, and streamlined workflows to maximize productivity. The customer executive is now the empowered agent - 59 percent of service professionals believe it's easier to use their company's Salesforce instance today than it was a year ago. Additionally, one in three companies have already invested in agent productivity apps; one in five are planning to invest. The best companies are leveraging Service Cloud to consolidate service channels and support a more informed and productive agent experience. For marketers, data is their customer - 60 percent of marketers cite poor or inconsistent data quality and lack of data access as their biggest challenge. As a result, only one in five companies believe their marketing messages are extremely personalized. Data-driven decisions separate a leading marketer from the competition. This year, leading marketers need to focus on partnering with IT to support a mature data governance strategy. Analytics is top of mind - 68 percent of companies will increase their investments in analytics in the coming year. In the past year, six percent of companies surveyed have adopted the new Analytics Cloud -- and 14 percent plan to invest in the coming year. The best companies are moving up the analytics maturity scale by investing in predictive and prescriptive intelligence tools to lead data-driven insights and take the best next action. Invest in ongoing innovation - Companies have realized the importance of investing in ongoing innovation and are embracing governance and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) to produce high quality releases with increasing speed. Companies that have both a governance board and an ALM solution are three times more likely to attribute revenue growth to their Salesforce usage. This year, there was a 20 percent jump in companies releasing at least monthly and three times as many companies releasing at least weekly. \nBluewolf's annual report surveyed more than 1,500 Salesforce customers. The respondents were employees of very large enterprises (more than 1,000 employees), large enterprises (up to 1,000 employees), and medium to small enterprises (fewer than 500 employees). The study was conducted via online survey in the second and third quarters of 2015. \n\nSalesforce and others are among the trademarks of salesforce.com , inc. \n\nAbout Bluewolf \nBluewolf is a global consulting agency that builds digital solutions designed to create results.

072d4574-0685-4d05-a784-7ed02b1da5f9	Verint ® Systems Inc. ( NASDAQ: VRNT ) today announced enhancements to its Verint \n      Situational Awareness Platform ™ , including the \n      incorporation of advanced solutions to help organizations gain \n      comprehensive situational awareness while driving rapid incident \n      response and enhanced field communications. This evolutionary \n      situational awareness platform is designed to provide security \n      executives and operators actionable intelligence and better insight by \n      incorporating unified situation monitoring, dispatch and incident \n      response, live field communications and real-time citizen input. \n\nThe Verint Situational Awareness Platform enables command-and-control \n      operators to play a valued and active role in incident management and \n      response by notifying users of emergency situations based on their \n      location. Additionally, data from mobile devices can be sent to the \n      command center, enabling the general public to report security concerns \n      and issues in real-time in support of the overall well-being of the \n      communities they live and work in. Using the Verint solution, first \n      responders and security personnel can leverage the Actionable \n      Intelligence ® it provides to gain a better understanding and \n      clearer picture of incidents through immediate information sharing in \n      the field. \n   \nThe extension of the Verint Situational Awareness Platform is \n      transforming the way users engage with responders, field resources, \n      other public safety stakeholders and the general public. It combines \n      situational awareness with built-in dispatch and bi-directional \n      information flow for continuous communication between citizens, intake \n      operators, field resources and command center personnel, and allows \n      responders to provide mobile reporting through video streaming and live \n      images. This correlates information from multiple sources into a single \n      platform for a unified view, enabling faster, more intelligent \n      decision-making in routine and emergency events. Additionally, the \n      solution can alert command-and-control operators from sensors and \n      provide Geographical Information Science (GIS) mapping, live \n      surveillance and other location information to help identify the closest \n      resources to dispatch for more rapid, efficient response. Comprehensive \n      incident reporting with multimedia options offers a further set of \n      enhancements to support post-incident investigations. \n\nAmong the latest enhancements to the Verint Situational Awareness \n      Platform are Dispatch Manager, Mobile Reporter, and Mobile Responder. \n      These capabilities, along with Verint Situation Manager, work in \n      conjunction to provide information through integration with intelligent \n      sensors and data sources, including big data analysis, video \n      surveillance and crowdsourcing. \nDispatch Manager functionality incorporates emergency dispatch \n        into the Situational Awareness Platform, helping reduce emergency \n        response time, while enhancing end-to-end communications throughout an \n        incident, creating safer environments and optimizing incident \n        management. Mobile Reporter capabilities allow businesses, agencies and \n        local citizens to share information directly from their smart devices, \n        allowing multi-dimensional response and communication. Mobile Reporter \n        also can send emergency notifications based on the location of the \n        user. Mobile Responder functionality relays critical information and \n        multimedia data from an incident, providing field personnel with more \n        real-time, accurate intelligence about an incident before arriving \n        on-site. \n“Verint continues as a pioneering force in the area of situational \n      awareness, advancing capabilities to help organizations prepare for and \n      address their most critical monitoring, dispatch and incident response, \n      and field communications requirements,” says Steve Weller, senior vice \n      president and general manager, Verint Video and Situation Intelligence \n      Solutions ™ . \n\nAdds Weller, “With the Verint Situational Awareness Platform, \n      organizations can gain a unified view and stronger, more accurate \n      insights to drive real-time communication, multi-agency collaboration \n      and multi-directional response—and employ a more proactive approach to \n      security, safety and citizen engagement.” \n\nAbout Verint Systems Inc. \n\nVerint ® is a global leader in Actionable Intelligence ® , \n      which has become a necessity in a dynamic world of massive information \n      growth.

40b907a8-d0cf-40e1-838d-61e10fcd1bbf	 \nJennifer Berson is the President & Founder of Jeneration PR, a Public Relations & Social Media Marketing firm specializing in promoting beauty, baby & lifestyle brands. Prior to founding Jeneration PR in 2005, Jennifer was a civil litigation attorney in Los Angeles. \n\nJennifer has been featured in the New York Times, Business Insider, Yahoo!, Entrepreneur Magazine, PR Week, Huffington Post, Fox 11 News, TV Guide Network's "Hollywood 411," PR Web and was profiled on Apple.com. Jennifer was also selected by Babble.com as one of the 10 "Mompreneur's Who Made it Big!" She lives in Sherman Oaks, California with her husband Kevin, a business broker and consultant, and their two boys, ages 3 and 5. \n\nHow has your life experience made you the leader you are today? \n\nI have always been very independent with the ability to entertain myself or work alone very efficiently--I think I get that from my mother who always manages to find something to do with her time. In high school, I won a leadership award in my senior year, not because I was student body president or in an obvious role as a leader, but because I was the class historian, and I worked independently, making sure to photograph every event. I ultimately created a scrapbook on my own without anyone telling me what had to be done. While that's not a leader in the "traditional" sense, having the drive to achieve a goal without being managed or guided by someone else does require leadership skills and encompasses the way I work today. My former career as a lawyer also taught me how to manage my time well, work efficiently, and handle all kinds of client personalities--these skills have all come in handy while leading my PR team and running my own business. \n\nHow has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Jeneration PR? \n\nPrior to starting my PR & social media marketing firm, I was a civil litigation attorney. While that career transition could be viewed as a complete 180, my background in law provided me with valuable skills that continue to serve me well in my PR career and as a business owner. In litigation, it's all about taking facts and crafting a story to best tell your side of the argument. In PR, we are essentially telling a brand's story, highlighting various facts & elements to best match our audience. Thanks to my law background, I developed sharp attention to detail and became an excellent writer. I can now see the bigger picture of how our PR services fit in to the overall growth strategy of a business. And if we're being completely honest, I know how to pursue clients who haven't paid their fees, so I have an excellent track record of collecting! Fortunately, this is a skill that I don't need to use too often. \n\nWhat have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Jeneration PR? \n\nThere have certainly been a few challenges--having to fire an account executive that was underperforming, managing & resetting clients' expectations when they are unrealistic, and accepting responsibility to our client when a member of my team makes a mistake. A specific challenge we overcame is that during the slow economy, I lost a few clients who couldn't afford our services. In order to prevent a catastrophic loss to our business, we were willing to work with clients, modifying rates to retain them and their business, cutting non-essential services to save them money. We focused on providing excellent service and value in order to help their businesses survive the slow economic climate, and when things bounced back, we were able to ramp up again to our regular level of engagement. \n\nIt's certainly more fun to reflect on the highlights than the challenges! I've had so many amazing experiences and career highlights during the last decade of running my business: I was profiled by Apple and featured on their website as an entrepreneur on-the-go using my Apple devices to stay connected and productive; I was selected by Babble.com as one of their "Top 10 Mompreneurs Who Made it Big!" and my home office received a gorgeous dream makeover, courtesy of HGTV. One day in particular that stands out as an absolutely incredible day was having TWO clients appear on the Ellen Degeneres Show and one of the TODAY Show, all on the same day! I was so incredibly proud and happy for my clients. \n\nHow are you marking the achievements of being in business for a decade? \n\nIt's been a ball celebrating our 10th year in business. I really can't believe how quickly a decade has flown by. I still enjoy what I do as much as I did when I first started, so I feel very fortunate about that. We've been sharing more tips and insider info through our newsletter and on Instagram, and we've stepped-up our marketing efforts around the #JENERAT10N hashtag, taking a look back at all of the best milestones and fun moments over the last decade. \n\nI am also working on developing comprehensive PR courses to help small brands learn all of the tricks of the trade so they can promote their businesses themselves. I am so excited to help many more business owners who are unable to afford a PR firm but who really deserve to have access to the media to share their great brands & products. \n\nWhat advice can you offer to women who are looking to follow a similar career path? \n\nMy path was certainly untraditional, but I learned some great lessons along the way. Before pursuing your own business, save up enough money in order to give yourself a long runway to make it happen. Also, consider trying to work in your new field for free--or for a very reduced rate--in order to gain experience, to see if you enjoy the work and to build up a body of work that you can use to showcase your talents. Finally, if you establish a company vs. putting yourself out there as a freelancer, you can ultimately charge more for your services. From the very beginning, I established Jeneration PR as an agency, even when it was just me. I always referred to the business as "we": "We can help you get great results," "We are excited about the opportunity to work together," "We have expertise in your industry...." This helps to build your reputation faster, and give you more credibility--and yes, charge higher rates--than if you are just an independent freelancer. \n\nHow do you maintain a work/life balance? \n\nThis is the $1Million question, isn't it? When I made the switch from my career in law to my own PR agency a decade ago, I was hoping to ultimately have more balance in my life and more time with my kids when I became a mom. While it's never easy to get everything done, and I still find myself working hard all of the time, I do feel that I have found more of the balance I was seeking and am very lucky to have a career where I'm still able to be part of my young children's lives--not because I've found the secret to attaining "work/life balance," but because I'm gentle with myself, accept my limitations, and give my sole attention to whatever (work) or whomever (my husband & my kids) needs it at any given moment. \n\nAs working moms (and dads), it's all too easy to get caught up in the idea that you don't have enough--or, more often, that you aren't giving enough--to every area of your life. I try to cut myself some slack. \n\nInstead of beating yourself up over everything you're not doing, try to remember that you're doing the best you can with what you have. Just changing your mental script can be so powerful. Replace the negative messages you are sending yourself with positive affirmations, and you'll likely accomplish more in work and life than you thought was possible. \n\nMaybe some people truly feel balanced in their work and their personal lives all the time--but I don't know any of those people. Even those who seem like they have it all together will tell you they have their own struggles. Nothing or nobody is perfect, myself included--and I try my best daily to be ok with that. \n\nInstead of constantly seeking a perfect 50/50 balance between the work that I do and the life that I lead, instead I make a commitment to stay present and focused on wherever I am and whatever needs my attention in a…
780ec73a-9edc-49c0-8d8b-0815e38e30ef	Whenever we do a Real Housewives “Where Are They Now?” story it’s usually not a happy ending, and it often involves a mug shot photo, foreclosure, and/or bankruptcy. But, for The Real Housewives of New York City OGs Alex McCord and Simon van Kempen, their post-Bravo fairy tale is one that is both a happy ending and wtf-worthily interesting! Just to get you caught up, Simon and Alex left RHONY in 2011 after four seasons. They were part of Bravo’s complete overhaul of the cast that also saw the departure of Jill Zarin, Kelly Bensimon, and Cindy Barshop. “Alex and I are sad that it’s come to this,” Simon said in a statement after the firings were confirmed by Bravo. “We had a great four years. We don’t intend for this to be the final time you’ll see us on television.” And it wasn’t the final time fans got to see Alex and Simon on television. In July of 2012 it was announced that they would appear on the second season of VH1’s Couples Therapy with Dr. Jenn. Since their appearance on Couples Therapy, Alex and Simon stayed away from the small screen for the most part, and the absence helped them gain a little perspective on their experience. “Although they’re reality shows, they swallow up your life and they become your reality,” Alex said in an interview with ABC North Coast NSW in June, “and then all of a sudden you don’t want to walk away from it because it’s such a big part of your life.” Simon added, “One thing a lot of people don’t realize is how much the show can take over one’s life and it defines you and there’s a struggle to break free from that.” So, late last year, the couple made a very bold decision to return to Simon’s home of New South Wales, Australia! The couple sold their 2.6 million dollar, six-bedroom, five bathroom townhouse in Brooklyn’s Cobble Hill and, in January, the family of four moved into their beautiful new home in the Ballina Shire village of Newrybar. Here’s a photo of their new digs (at least for one year) courtesy of Alex: Presenting….our new home! She's a beautiful old Queenslander and ours for the next year. A photo posted by Alex McCord (@mccordalex) on Jan 15, 2015 at 4:20pm PST And how about that view?! First order of business in the new house? Testing out the pool. Of course! Last day of summer; school starts tomorrow! A photo posted by Alex McCord (@mccordalex) on Jan 26, 2015 at 4:58pm PST Alex explained their decision to relocate to Australia in a letter to The Dish in September of last year: After 18 years in New York for Alex, and 28 years outside Australia for Simon, we’ve made the decision to move to Australia to be with family. Over the last few years, all of Simon’s family have reconvened from as far as Europe to all live within 20 minutes of each other on a collection of beautiful beaches on the north coast of New South Wales. We are the last of the family to move back, and it’s time. Our children have never had the opportunity to live within walking distance of grandparents and cousins, and with our two boys aged 8 and 10 it’s the perfect time for the extended family to enjoy each other. We both love New York City, and Brooklyn specifically, almost as much as each other; however, we’ve been there, done that and written the book—literally—on raising Little Kids in the Big City. It’s now time for a new adventure. We both firmly believe that change is necessary in order to grow, and to do that, we need to get out of our comfort zone. When we realized that we’d quit traveling because New York was so comfortable and had everything we need, when we realized our 8 year old had only ever lived in one house—we realized it was time. So what are Simon, 51, and Alex, 42, planning on doing to make ends meet? That is perhaps my favorite part of the story! Simon has traded in his reality show stardom and has opened a law firm with his brother! WHUH?!? The firm, called van Kempen & Associates, opened in July and focuses on property law and conveyancing. (Conveyancing is the transfer of legal title of property from one person to another, or the granting of an encumbrance such as a mortgage or a lien.) Here is a photo of the firm’s storefront followed by a description of the firm from their website: Van Kempen & Associates Conveyancing and Property Law combines the experience of brothers Adam van Kempen, principal of long established Byron Bay law firm BvK Pty Ltd, and Simon van Kempen harnessing their legal expertise and business acumen to Tweed Shire. Operating out of the Tweed Heads CBD, van Kempen & Associates provides expert Conveyancing Servicing and Property Law advice to the Tweed Coast, Gold Coast and surrounding hinterland. Here’s an ad for van Kempen & Associates from the Tweed Daily news in August, 2015: Alex and Simon’s two sons, Francois, 11, and Johan, 9, appear to be handling the international transition well. Here they are in their school uniforms: “We’re really enjoying our time here and have made lovely friends, and the boys are close to their cousins and grandparents which is what we wanted for them,” Alex told the Gold Coast Bulletin this week. And speaking of Alex, she’s not resting on her laurels. She is reportedly studying psychology with plans to write a thesis on reality television. Congratulations to both Simon and Alex! I’m guessing it goes against everything they are trying to do, but I would sure tune in if Bravo had a Simon & Alex Down Under reality series. Or maybe The Real Housewives of Byron Bay?

f0ab14d7-e5fb-446a-b382-661956f5c156	It's the coffee issue that has plagued baristas the world over – how to make a soy or almond milk latte without having the milk split and curdle into an unpalatable mess. \n\nHow to make almond milk It's the coffee issue that has plagued hipsters and baristas the world over – how to make a soy or almond milk latte without having the milk split and curdle into an unpalatable mess.\n\nAn Australian company has now solved the scientific puzzle, and is about to release a range of milks that have been designed and blended to work specifically with black coffee.\n\nSome of the nation's leading baristas have worked on the MILKLAB with Freedom Foods, which has been making gluten-free and allergen-free products since 1990, to create the new range of milks.\n\n"Australians drink nearly 4 billion cups of coffee year, and the majority of those are made with cheap $1 a litre milk bought straight off the supermarket shelf," said Angelo De Blasio, brand manager for Freedom Foods.\n\n"Australians love great coffee. We have most likely the best coffee culture in the world, but there was nothing in terms of milk designed to go with it. So we decided to invent it."\n\nThe key factors that cause soy and almond milk to curdle are the high acidity of black coffee and temperature. The coffee acts as a coagulant, causing the milk to split and curdle in a cup.\n\nFreedom will not reveal the secrets of some its blends. "I can tell you, getting almond milk not to split, or getting soy milk not to split and curdle when you add very hot coffee, is no easy task," De Blasio said. "It has taken us over a year. We have adjusted calcium levels, added some natural vegetable gums. The end result is we have range of milks that are perfectly matched to the acidity of high-quality espresso coffee."\n\nTo get the blends right, the MILKLAB project engaged the help of baristas in Australia and around the world, including Melbourne's Gem Fusca from Percy's Aeroplane Cafe in Kew, China's Andy Lu and Instagram's @latteartporn barista Matthew Lakejev from Sydney, whose displays of latte art have garnered him a social media following of more than 14,000.\n\n"They will not split no matter what kind of coffee or roast you throw at them," said Fusca. "I have never encountered non-dairy milks like it."\n\nThe new range of products includes milks made from soy, almond and coconut milk, as well as a lactose-free dairy milk.\n\nMILKLAB was launched at a party for 1000 latte lovers in Sydney on Friday. The story first appeared on Good Food.
7b29861d-746b-450e-b9e5-52db4d17b15e	When Ilma Lopez decided to organize a fundraiser for the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital , she didn’t set out to ask only female chefs to participate. \n \n“These women, I think they’re amazing,” she said. “They’re people who it’s a no-brainer for me to work with. I’m serious. It just so happens that they’re all female.” \n \nLopez and at least one of the other chefs have had family members hospitalized during the past year, an experience that opened their eyes to the importance of having quality healthcare in the community, and resources for families trying to cope with serious illness or injury. In Lopez’s case, it was her husband and business partner Damian Sansonetti. \n \n“You’re just like what the heck happened? And everything stopped,” she said. “You keep doing your day to day, but you don’t realize how hard it is until you’re the person at 3 a.m. in the hallway, waiting for someone to tell you what’s going on.” \n \nIn Krista Desjarlais’ case, it was her daughter Cortland, who had an unexpected seizure and was diagnosed with benign partial epilepsy, a condition that is expected to last into her teenage years. Desjarlais and her husband, Erik, spent three months visiting doctors and hospitals. \n \n“We saw so many children who were far worse off than Cortland,” Desjarlais said. “You realize how important funding is.” \n \nLopez’s daughter Isabella was also part of the inspiration for choosing the Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital to be the recipient of the Fabulous Femmes fundraiser . Lopez, a native of Venezuela, can’t show her daughter her home country because of political unrest, \n \n“I want to create a better community where Isabella can always come back home,” Lopez said. “I want Isabella to always have that. The only way I can create that is if it’s me doing something.” \n \nAlex Wight, creator of the Flanagan’s Table dinners in Buxton, donated the venue. Tabitha Perry of Crush Distributors will provide the wine, and Briana Volk of Portland Hunt & Alpine Club will be mixing cocktails. Lopez is hoping this $150-per-plate dinner will be the first of many; she hopes to start a nonprofit organization that will run future culinary fundraisers for the children’s hospital. She’d like to include in those events former patients and their families who can speak to diners about their experiences at the hospital. \n \n“We’re so lucky to have a place like that in Maine for our kids,” Lopez said. “I don’t want to use it, but how lucky are we?”

d5d7cd17-a82b-4b9e-b94a-68d2598435e9	MAPPING THE ISRAELI NETWORK BEHIND THE JFK ASSASSINATION By Michael Collins Piper The State of Israel had integral llinks with all of  the major power groups that wanted John F. Kennedy removed from the American presidency. Israel’s global network had the power to orchestrate not only the assassination of Kennedy, but also the subsequent cover-up. Israel was indeed a key player in the JFK assassination conspiracy and, the evidence suggests, a primary instigator of the crime.\nAll of Israel’s co-conspirators—and those who had an interest in seeing Kennedy dead—had good reason to assist in the cover-up. They were protecting their own interests. By 1963, John F. Kennedy had made many enemies. His brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s prosecutions of Mafia and Meyer Lansky-bossed Organized Crime figures had many in the crime syndicate very angry, to say the least. The early stages for the prosecution of Meyer Lansky himself were already underway. A case had already been made against Lansky’s New Orleans front man Carlos Marcello.Lansky’s West Coast henchman Mickey Cohen had been targeted as well\nTHE ISRAELI-CONNECTED LANSKY SYNDICATE Lansky was the ultimate target: the enmity between the Kennedy family and Meyer Lansky went back decades. Not only was the President’s father, Joseph P. Kennedy considered an enemy of the Jewish people, but he was also believed by Lansky to hold a grudge against him (Lansky) because of a Lansky-orchestrated hijacking of one of Kennedy Sr.’s illicit whiskey running deals. Considering John F. Kennedy’s secret alliance with the mob during the 1960 campaign, his war against Lansky’s underworld syndicate was a double-cross that could not be tolerated.\nLyndon johnson The president was also planning to drop his Vice President, Lyndon Johnson, from the 1964 ticket. It was possible that Johnson—long financed politically by Lansky and his New Orleans Mafia henchman, Carlos Marcello—could end up spending the remainder of his years in prison. The Kennedy brothers were interested in Johnson’s deals conducted through his front man, Bobby Baker, who later did end up in prison. Baker, of course, conducted several of his major deals with Lansky associates, including Ed Levinson, a director of the Mossad-linked Banque de Credit International, founded by former Mossad official Tibor Rosenbaum.\nTHE ANTI-CASTRO CUBANS What’s more, Kennedy was preparing for a rapprochement with Castro’s Cuba and therefore the Lansky syndicate would not be able to re-invigorate its massive gambling interests there as a consequence. The change in Cuban policy was also distressing to the anti-Castro Cuban community in Miami, New Orleans and elsewhere. \nThe anti-Castro Cubans had, of course, been cooperating closely with the Lansky syndicate in anti-Castro activities. Likewise, the new Cuban policy enraged the CIA which was the primary sponsor of the anti-Castro forces. As we have also seen, the Mossad played a major (although little-known) part in the intrigue involving the anti-Castro Cubans through its base in Miami.\nTHE CIA JFK had other problems with the CIA. He was making moves to dismantle the CIA and was engaged in a secret war with that agency stemming from his clear intent to withdraw U.S. forces from Vietnam. This would have been a major blow to the so-called “military-industrial complex” (of which the Israeli lobby was a major component) that stood to make immense profits from a continuing U.S. presence in Southeast Asia.\nHOOVER above – John Kennedy and his brother Rob. Both were kicking ass and taking names – they paid the price for trying to take on the Illuminati Jewish Central Banking Cartel and their myriad of lackeys infested in government. Ultimately, Kennedy planned to merge all of the American intelligence agencies—the FBI included—into a single entity under his brother Robert’s direction. This plan, of course, was not greeted enthusiastically by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover whom Kennedy also planned to dethrone following the 1964 election. Hoover, as we have seen, had his own secret arrangements with Lansky, individually, and with organized crime in general. Hoover also had a foundation established in his name with funding from Lansky-linked liquor industries and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) of B’nai B’rith, which functions as a de facto U.S. propaganda and intelligence arm of Israel’s Mossad. If Hoover himself did not actively conspire against the life of John F. Kennedy, he certainly looked the other way if he knew a conspiracy to assassinate JFK had been hatched.\nVIETNAM & DRUGS Kennedy’s intended change in Vietnam policy—his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the imbroglio—infuriated not only the CIA but elements in the Pentagon and their allies in the military-industrial complex. By thistime, of course, the Lansky syndicate had already set up international heroinrunning from Southeast Asia through the CIA-linked Corsican Mafia in the  Mediterranean. The joint Lansky-CIA operations in the international drug racket were a lucrative venture that thrived as a consequence of deep U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia as cover for the drug smuggling activities. We know today that the Mossad has emerged as a major player as a “middleman” in much of this drug-smuggling activity.\nISRAEL, THE CIA & THE LANSKY SYNDICATE John F. Kennedy’s bitter behind-the-scenes conflict with Israel brought him into combat with an ally of not only the CIA but also the Lansky syndicate, both of which entities also maintained intimate connections to the anti-Castro Cubans. Vice President Lyndon Johnson’s Lansky-Mafia and defense industry ties, coupled with his close relationship to the Israeli lobby, and his long-standing friendly dealings with both the CIA and Hoover’s FBI made Johnson an acceptable alternative (among these diverse special interests) to a Kennedy dynasty. Kennedy himself had long been suspect in the eyes of Israel and its allies as we saw in Chapter 4.\nWe also now know that even the famed “Chicago Mafia” under Sam Giancana was heavily immersed in wide-ranging international dealings with Israel’s Mossad—largely through the good offices of the real boss of the Chicago syndicate, Meyer Lansky’s partner-in-crime, Hyman Lamer. So the theory that even “the Chicago Mafia killed JFK”—we find—has a very distinct “Mossad connection” beyond any doubt.\nMICKEY COHEN As early as 1960 (as we documented in Chapter 13), Meyer Lansky’s West Coast henchman, Mickey Cohen, was using Kennedy’s filmland bedpartner, actress Marilyn Monroe, as a conduit for attempting to learn Kennedy’s intentions toward Israel. Kennedy’s introduction to Miss Monroe by one of Cohen’s associates, we have learned, was for this very purpose, and also, perhaps, for ultimately blackmailing JFK. Although “official” history acknowledges the president’s stormy affair with Miss Monroe, its real origins—and the intent for which it was orchestrated—have been covered up and forgotten.\nabove – poor marilyn was used and abused by the jews in the hollywood and the mossad connected Meyer Lansky crime syndicate – she was killed so she would never be able to spill the beans on how the jews used her to pump info out of JFK regarding his stance towards ISrael (“Official” history would have us remember—instead—Kennedy’s other widely-publicized illicit relationship with Judith Campbell, mistress of Chicago Mafia boss Sam Giancana.) Cohen, a long-standing disciple of Israel and one of its earliest adherents, had more than a passing interest in the Middle East state. According to one account, we have discovered, Cohen was less than happy with Kennedy’s stance toward Israel.\nBEN-GURION AND THE ISRAELI NUCLEAR BOMB By April 1963, Kennedy’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and the state of Israel was at a dangerous impasse, particularly over Israel’s determination to develop a nuclear bomb. At Kennedy’s last official press conference, he bemoaned the Israeli lobby’s deliberate sabotage of his own efforts to build bridges to the Arab world. Little did JFK know that the seeds of his own destruction had been sown as a consequence of his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East Israeli leader David Ben-Gurion had developed an intense personal distrust—even hatred and contempt—for Kennedy.\nHe believed that Kennedy’s presidency was a danger to the very survival of the state of Israel—the nation that Ben-Gurion had helped create. Ben-Gurion, by this time, was consumed with paranoia. He believed that Israel might be destroyed. It was because of his contempt for Kennedy and the American president’s stance toward Israel that Ben-Gurion left his post as prime minister. It is likely that his last act as prime minister was to order Mossad orchestration of a hit on John F. Kennedy. We have learned that it was then-Mossad assassination team chief Yitzhak Shamir who took care of the arrangements necessary to set the conspiracy in motion. Shamir knew, of course, that a diverse array of interests—domestic and international—would like to see Kennedy removed from the White House.\nThere were a variety of components that could be put together to ensure a successful assassination conspiracy: specifically the Mossad-linked Meyer Lansky Organized Crime Syndicate as well as the CIA, and the elements in their spheres of influence. Was there a code name for the conspiracy against President Kennedy? More than likely. But we, of course, will surely never know its name. Did the Mossad, perhaps, call it “Operation Haman”—naming the conspiracy to kill the American president after Haman, the ancient Amalekite conspirator who desired the destruction of the Jewish people? That code name would be as reasonable as any, considering Ben-Gurion’s hatred for Kennedy—a modern-day Haman in his eyes.\nTHE CONSPIRACY IS SET IN MOTION A network of assassin recruitment and planning was set in motion through the aegis of the Mossad-CIA-Lansky combine, with the shadowy Permindex entity at the very center of the operation. All stood to benefit from John F. Kennedy’s removal from office. Many people on the periphery of the conspiracy—indeed, perhaps even many of those at the center—did not know how or why they were being directed to undertake many of the actions that they did that advanced the ultimate aim of removing JFK from the White House.\n(G.P.J.''\n(G.P.J.''''.J.P.G)\nMichael Collins Piper: FINAL JUDGEMENT lecture [Mossad connection to JFK Conspir

67e8bfc6-da54-4b83-ad87-120c45c1115d	(Photo: Contributed) \n\nJudaism’s holiest time of the year begins Sunday night, but something special will be held Saturday afternoon in Montgomery with a program focusing on two men named Abraham who figured prominently in Alabama history. \n\nAbraham Mordecai is believed to have been one of the first white residents in the territory from which Alabama was carved while Abraham Joshua Heschel took part in the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge after “Bloody Sunday” in 1965. \n\nThe event, which is called “Redigging the Wells of Two Modern Jewish Patriarchs,” begins at 1 p.m. and continues through the afternoon at River City Church at 301 Dexter Ave. where attendees will have an opportunity to learn more about the two historic figures and their contributions to the state. \n\nTemple Beth Or Rabbi Elliot Stevens has described Heschel as “one of the great philosophers and theologians of the 20th century, someone who “transcended denominational boundaries.” \n\n“His books are universally admired and he was considered a great spiritual leader during his lifetime,” Stevens said. \n\nSusannah Heschel, the late rabbi’s daughter, is a noted Dartmouth College scholar where she is professor of Jewish Studies. She will speak at the church at 2 p.m. \n\nPaul Hughes of Birmingham, who helped organize “Redigging The Wells Selma,” a 22-day prayer initiative culminating with an event last April linked to Passover, said Saturday’s program is a free educational event. \n\n“It is for the general public honoring two modern Jewish “Abrahams” who made profound historical and spiritual contributions to Alabama,” said Hughes. \n\nBorn in 1755 in Philadelphia, Pa., Abraham Mordecai was a Jewish pioneer and Indian trader believed to have been the first of his religion to become involved in events that shaped the Southeast including Alabama before statehood. \n\nHe maintained a good relationship with Indian tribes in the region and married a Creek woman. He and his family moved to an area known as Holy Ground along the banks of the Alabama River around 1819—the year Alabama was admitted to the Union. He died in 1850. \n\nWhen Alabama State Troopers and Dallas County sheriff’s deputies routed hundreds of peaceful black protesters on the Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. issued a call for ministers to come to Selma to take part in a march to Montgomery two weeks later to seek equal voting rights for blacks. \n\nHeschel, born in Poland in 1907, was descended from a prominent European family of rabbis and quickly established himself as one of Europe’s leading Jewish theologians. He had help in leaving Poland and coming to America as the Nazis overran the country but most members of his family died in the Holocaust. \n\nHe authored several widely read books on Jewish Philosophy and became involved in the civil rights movement, establishing a close friendship with King who placed him in the front row of prominent of marchers crossing the bridge on March 21, 1965. \n\nWant to go? \n\nWHAT: Redigging The Wells \n\nWHERE: River City Church, 301 Dexter Ave. in Montgomery \n\nWHEN: Saturday \n\n• 1 p.m. Remembering Rabbi Abraham Heschel (1907-1972) \n\nTheologian, philosopher, author and friend of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \n\n• 2-2:30 p.m. Reception \n\nPresented by Dartmouth College Jewish Studies professor Susannah Heschel \n\n• 2:30 p.m. Remembering Abraham Mordecai (1755-1849) \n\nPresented by Robert Somerville, author, historian and pastor \n\nJudaism’s major holidays. \n\nROSH HASHANAH: The Jewish New Year is the first of two High Holy Days also known as the Days of Awe. It usually occurs in the early autumn and is a two-day celebration for traditional Jews. Reform Jews usually observe it for one day. \n\nThe first major Jewish holiday of the year is 5776. It is said to be the anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman and their first actions toward the realization of humanity’s role in God’s world. Customs include sounding the shofar, a hollowed-out ram’s horn and eating symbolic foods such as apples dipped in honey to evoke a “sweet new year.” \n\nYOM KIPPUR: Regarded as the “Sabbath of Sabbaths,” Yom Kippur is the most solemn day in Judaism, a day in which Jews seek forgiveness of their sins from God. According to Jewish tradition, God inscribes each person’s fate during Rosh Hashanah for the coming year into the “Book of Life.” \n\nJews try to amend their behavior and seek forgiveness for wrongs done against God and those they may have harmed. The day is filled with private petitions and confessions of guilt. At the end of the day, they hope that they have been forgiven by God. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1EZxTsf
b1ccb02d-a55d-4eb0-aa75-53aa63955167	As we continue to celebrate Dine Out for No Kid Hungry Month , Share Our Strength supporter chef Jason Alley, co-owner of Comfort , which just marked its 13 th year in business, and Pasture restaurants in Richmond, Virginia, discusses his experiences with childhood hunger, why school breakfast and lunch should be available to all students, and the worst thing you can donate to a food bank. \n \nYou faced food insecurity regularly as a child. How did that affect your everyday life? \n \nIt creates massive stress. I grew up in southwest Virginia around the Appalachian Mountains, and we were certainly not alone in being poor in that area. There’s a lot of poverty. Food was always scarce. Growing up rural was nice because we had plenty of friends that hunted, and my grandmother had a garden, but that didn’t always make the cut. So food was always first and foremost on our minds all the time, like, how are we gonna make this happen? How are we going to get everybody fed? \n \nCan you remember some of the toughest periods? \n \nThere were many times when I moved to Florida with my mom when there were weeks and weeks in which it was literally school lunch and white rice at home. That would just be it for extended periods of time. \n \nAs a child, how did you sit through school and succeed when you’re so undernourished? \n \nI didn’t really succeed. I was unmotivated to be at school. Think about if you’re sitting at your desk and you had to skip breakfast, and now it’s lunchtime. You bottom out. You find yourself dozing off at your desk. You get hangry and cranky. Now, imagine that being a habitual thing. To think anyone is going to be successful under those circumstances is just unreasonable. \n \nThe free breakfast and lunch programs that a lot of schools have gone to are crucial in setting the stage for success for these kids. Our kids are starting public middle school for the first time this year, and their school has free breakfast and free lunch for every kid in the school. \n \nWhen it’s available to everyone, I would imagine there is less of a stigma. \n \nWhen I was a kid I had my little free lunch card. You’re going through puberty, kids are already starting to get bullied, you don’t have the cool clothes, and now, oh yeah, here’s your poor kid card. Have a great day! That’s just an added stressor. I think it is really progressive for a school to alleviate that stress. You know what? It’s free for everybody. Nobody pays, nobody gets singled out. \n \n\n \nWere there other resources to help you and your family? \n \nWe benefited from local food banks and a lot of church food closets. There were plenty of days where we would have been even hungrier had that not been available. \n \nI feel like it’s hard for some people to take that step and go to food pantries, as if there were shame in it. \n \nWe’re a shaming culture. We’re really good at it. If you’re hungry and you need help, there’s nothing wrong with that. It sucks to feel as though you have to ask for charity, but it’s more important to look at the positives it brings. It makes everybody feel good. I don’t think there’s anybody who’s working at or going to a food pantry or food bank that is going to be looking down their nose at you. It’s a shared experience. If you can accept the help for what it is, which is help and generosity, and you can use that to get yourself moving forward, then everything is working how it’s supposed to work. \n \nBeing surrounded by the bounty of food you are able to serve, are you ever conflicted? \n \nSometimes there’s a little bit of an esoteric dilemma because I know about hunger, and I know that there are tons and tons of people in that situation. I provide for my family by providing what is really a luxury service. On our best days, though, we also provide a place for people to get together and enjoy one another and have these special occasions. And it’s fantastic, but there are those days where you’re like, man, here I am selling $25 entrees and there’s a kid who’s not eating today aside from a free lunch at school. It’s a constant concern, and we are firm believers in utilizing everything we possibly can, out of respect for the animal that gave its life to the farmer that grew produce, and then obviously to be respectful to people who don’t have the opportunity to come in and drop fifty bucks on dinner. But, what we do has given us the opportunity give back a bit, which I think is super important. \n \nChefs and restaurateurs are always being approached for charitable endeavors, and it seems they usually find a way to say yes. \n \nThe restaurant industry as a whole is a very charity conscious industry. People definitely give until it hurts. It’s interesting because it’s not an industry that’s known for super-high profit margins, but we still always find a way to do these little things to help out when we can. \n \nI know that for me, a lot of that is a sense of responsibility. And, it just feels good that through all your hard work you are able to contribute something. \n \nHow did you come to be involved with Share Our Strength and No Kid Hungry? \n \nWhen I was in Atlanta, we did work with Share Our Strength – that was about fifteen years ago – and I was really blown away. It is such a great charity. And then when we moved to Virginia, they didn’t yet have a huge presence. So when we started to focus our charity efforts on anti-hunger campaigns, we started doing it locally and very grassroots. In Richmond, we have an anti-hunger umbrella company called Feedmore that does backpack programs, community kitchens, food banks, and meals on wheels and they are very efficient. \n \nAnd, when our current governor, Terry McAuliffe, was elected, his wife, Dorothy, really took up the mantle of childhood hunger and food insecurity as her push. So, that’s created a lot of opportunities to get more of these Share Our Strength events here. We’re in constant talks with them to try to get more events set up. They’re an amazing organization. \n \nIn addition to participating in Dine Out for No Kid Hungry Month, what can people do to join the fight against childhood hunger? \n \nTake time and go to your local food bank and drop some money there. Not just a can of crappy creamed corn that you don’t want that’s been in your cabinet for the last three years. Give them some loot or take three hours and go and volunteer and do some work. It’s great to donate food to pantries, but the impact that time and money provides is important. If you volunteer, it gives you a more tangible sense of what that is. And I think that most people who get involved in a program like that stay involved. \n \nIf you do donate food, we encourage people to go buy things that are easy and self-contained. Don’t give boxes of dried macaroni and cheese because I remember as a kid getting that, but then we didn’t have any milk and we didn’t have any butter. So now you’ve got crappy noodles and water and cheese powder. Buy the one with the squeeze pack, and you can feed two to three people out of that box and it’s there and it’s done. The local food banks here are also really pushing produce and fresh produce. And, that’s hard for an individual to donate, so that’s where those cash donations really come into play. \n \nSpeaking of mac and cheese, there can be a tendency for people of privilege to look down on food choices being made by those for whom hunger is an issue. \n \nYou might see poor people buying crappy food. And some of that is time, and some of it is education. What people don’t think about are the far-reaching implications. If you’re so impoverished that you can’t afford food for your family, you’re not on the internet looking up recipes on how to use kale. You don’t have a computer. You don’t have the Internet. People who are sitting in judgment aren’t thinking about how devastating that overall level of poverty is. And that’s why these education programs are key. Creating recipes for fresh food so that when people do get it they know what to do with it; it doesn’t sit on the counter and rot. \n \nWhat people don’t realize is that you can still get a $5 fast-food combo meal and it’s just done and you’re full. Can you buy some pork and pinto beans and cucumbers for that same amount and still have a great meal? Sure. But do you have those three hours to cook a pot of pinto beans? \n \nWe sit in our towers and judge them. Like, oh, we feel great about ourselves because look at what we’re using from our CSA boxes and these poor people are still eating McDonalds. Don’t they know? And they don’t. Or they know and they don’t see another option that works for them. They’re doing the best they can. We have to change the way we look at that. \n \nThere’s a lot of talk about the death of the family dinner in our society, and it feels like hunger likely plays a role in that. \n \nWhen you’re sitting down as a parent and you realize that you don’t have enough food to go around for everybody, it’ s just a crushing sense of defeat and failure. And it’s hard to be loving around the table when all you’re seeing is your inability to provide. \n \nThat’s part of the thing that creates this cycle of failure. When you feel like a failure, it’s not motivating. I don’t know how we fix that without some serious income redistribution. I do think that the real base fix is making sure that people aren’t hungry. If you’re hungry, you’re not thinking straight. You’re pissed off. You’re tired. Your health fails. You’re sick. That’s not exactly how you go out and get it together and make it all happen. It’s hard to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when you don’t have the strength to do it. \n \nMake a reservation to support Dine Out for No Kid Hungry Month , and join Team No Kid Hungry to help connect children in need with healthful meals.  \n \nThe post Chef Jason Alley on Growing up with Food Insecurity + Why #NoKidHungry Matters More Than Ever appeared first on OpenTable Blog .
54ce3f1c-7c7f-439d-a30c-58d4bc51e603	Their relationship dates back 20 years, when both Frank Zurek and Larry Scott were work colleagues at Amoco Corporation and began going to lunch together, sometimes as often as four times per week. That friendship developed into something deeper and they then began having drinks and dinners after work. \n\nNeither was out at work, so they didn't come out to each other for months. \n\n\nThen one day, while having drinks together after work at The North End in Lakeview, each admitted he was gay. \n\n\n"I don't recall where the first real dinner date was, but it was downtown after work and Frank ordered calamari," Scott said. "That fact alone guaranteed I wanted a second date because I'm an adventurous eater. This was in January 1996; by Valentine's Day, we considered ourselves a couple." \n\n\nFast-forward to Sept. 12, 2015, to a short walk to the lakefront from North End, or Cell Block, where they also frequented in the mid-1990s. More importantly, there was also the famous totem pole near Addison Street. \n\n\n"The primary significance is that [the totem pole] is where we meet with the Frontrunners/Frontwalkers each week. Second as native Chicagoans, the lakefront is symbolic of the city and certainly a beautiful place to have a wedding ceremony. And, the totem pole is in Boystown, and we gay men, [so] it symbolizes the social aspect of our living in Chicago," Scott said. \n\n\nCheers followed the short morning ceremony, officiated by Judge James E. Snyder, who also is a runner in training for a marathon. \n\n\n"Although we thought about having the ceremony in Florida, [where we now are living, except for the summers in Chicago, but] we have family and friends in Chicago where we had lived our entire lives before we moved to Florida in 2009," Scott said. "We decided that we would get married in Chicago and only wanted to have a small civil ceremony, but we wanted to include our family and friends from the Chicago area." \n\n\nZurek added, "Although we did not want to do anything very elaborate, we were certainly not averse to something different and unique. The one idea that seemed to grab us was the thought of holding the ceremony at the totem pole, where we walk [from] twice a week with the Chicago Frontrunners/Frontwalkers while we are in Chicago during the summer. We thought about the best time for the ceremony, [be it] before or after the run, and decided that before would be best since everyone would be there and fresh before the run." \n\n\nThey ran the idea past David Reithoffer, president of Chicago Frontrunners, so he could check with the Board and make sure the idea would be acceptable. "When he gave us the approval, we had a week to throw the event together," Scott said. \n\n\nZurek, 66, originally retired in 2008 and then formally retired in 2014 from Acro Staffing as a consultant, IT procurement. Scott, 61, retired as an IT manager from INEOS Corporation in 2009. \n\n\nThey live in Wilton Manors, Florida, when not in Chicago. \n\n\nThe couple went on a traditional walk after their vows, photos and more celebratory cheers. \n\n\nScott and Zurek had matching shirts and shorts, with their Frontrunners/Frontwalkers running shirts underneath that went on display after they were pronounced husband and husband. \n\n\nBoth noted that the predominantly gay Frontrunners/Frontwalkers provides an opportunity to meet other LGBT on a social level, as well as providing regular exercise. "The group is quite diverse and we enjoy conversing with the members during social events and dinners and breakfast," Scott said. "We have developed great friendships with some of the members who have come down to visit us in Florida during the winter. And some of our Florida Frontrunners have visited us in Chicago during the summer as well." \n\n\nZurek added, "Certainly when I was coming-out as a young man in Chicago, I never envisioned that one day we would actually be able to get married. I feel that I was fortunate living in Chicago where an active GLBT community was evolving. Although Larry and I have now been together almost 20 years, it seems only right to formalize our relationship and call each other 'husband.'"

838defd8-c053-4f9b-9e33-b11b2ba899e0	(CNN) -  \nA Chinese military jet performed an "unsafe" maneuver in front of a U.S. reconnaissance plane last week, the Pentagon said Tuesday. \n \nThe announcement came the same day that China's President, promoting peace and downplaying differences, arrived in Seattle to start a potentially pivotal U.S. visit. \n\nA U.S. RC-135 aircraft operating above the Yellow Sea, approximately 80 miles east of the Shandong Peninsula, reported the September 15 incident after the Chinese jet passed in front of the RC-135, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters. \n\n"One of the maneuvers conducted by the Chinese aircraft during this intercept was perceived as unsafe by the RC-135 air crew and at this point, right now, there's no indication this was a near collision, but the report that came back was that the plane operated in an unsafe fashion," Cook said. \n\nThe intercept follows a more dangerous maneuver last year when an armed Chinese fighter jet came within approximately 20 feet of a U.S. Navy P-8 aircraft, at one point rolling to its side to show the U.S. plane its weapons load, Pentagon officials said at the time. \n\nWhile last week's incident was not seen of as provocative, Cook said the incident was still under review. \n\nIt's already rankled some in Washington. Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the "dangerous Chinese intercept of a U.S. aircraft last week shows that China feels emboldened to continue its pattern of aggressive behavior in the Asia-Pacific region." \n\nThe tables have turned before: In May China's navy issued warnings eight times as a U.S. surveillance plane swooped over islands that Beijing has claimed over its neighbors' opposition. And two years ago, two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers flew through air space claimed by China. \n\nFrom Beijing's perspective, the timing of Tuesday's announcement from the Pentagon certainly could have been better. President Xi Jinping is in the United States and will have an official state visit Friday with his American counterpart, Barack Obama. \n\nIn a written interview with the Wall Street Journal, Xi downplayed differences between the two countries, saying "even family members don't always see eye to eye with each other." \n\nAs to China possibly flexing its military muscles, the President insisted his country's approach is "defensive in nature." \n\n"In strengthening our defense and military,... we are not going after some kind of military adventure," Xi said. "It never crosses my mind."

3187a4e9-0163-4411-9650-43ef00129884	By Wednesday, September 2nd, 2015 \n    \nBy Mohammed Fahad Al-Harthi \n \nThe first official visit of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman to Washington beginning on Thursday comes at a crucial time in the history of Saudi-US relations. \n \nMuch anticipation surrounds the visit which will see a number of sensitive issues being brought to the table. It is no secret that Saudi-US differences have affected the region. The American mistake in Iraq and Washington’s pointless and naive withdrawal pushing the country into the Iranian swamp is one example. \n \nOther issues such as the Saudi-US disagreement regarding the June 30, 2013, events in Egypt, the shameful retraction of President Obama’s red line on the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the settlement afterward have also led to the two countries drifting apart. The situation has been worsened by the Iranian nuclear agreement that poses more questions than answers. \n \nProbably the most important question is whether our problem with Iran is limited to the nuclear deal. Many feel that the problem has its roots in Iran’s political policies in the region. Tehran seems to insist on intervening in internal Arab affairs and inciting sectarianism in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Yemen. \n \nWhile Riyadh and other Gulf capitals voice reservations, Washington is busy working for the agreement. Internally, the deal must be approved by Congress and externally, the Americans must keep other countries convinced of the deal’s importance. The Gulf states have made their position and desires clear: A region free of nuclear weapon and free of political conflicts, wars and militias — all of which are linked to Iran. \n \nSaudis recognize the strategic value and importance of the bilateral relations between Riyadh and Washington. As relations have stretched over a long history of ups and downs, the foundation and shared interests of the two countries have met all challenges. This has been particularly true when, on numerous occasions, Saudi-US relations have served as the region’s safety valve. \n \nSaudis stress the importance of the strategic relationship for both countries, acknowledging that disagreements arise from time to time. Washington has sought Saudi wisdom and experience many times since it knows that the Kingdom is a country with balanced and credible political thought which rejects extremism. This translates into both countries needing each other. \n \nThe claims that the declining US interest in Saudi oil negatively affects the alliance are short-sighted. Saudi Arabia is not a barrel of oil but an influential country, a great economic power and member of the G-20. Shared interests thus override the points of dispute. \n \nKing Salman, a veteran decision-maker and the experienced consultant of previous Saudi rulers, understands the importance of bilateral relations. Just as we saw in Operation Decisive Storm, he can be firm and take the initiative, knowing that Arabs can protect their interests in the region and will not acquiesce in the face of expansionist powers. \n \nIn diplomatic relations between countries, respect is for the powerful. And power means not only military force but also the ability to influence and build political alliances. In this context, the Gulf system remains one of the most influential forces in the region, led by the highest-level coordination between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. \n \nThe two countries filled the vacuum in the Arab political system and, with their alliance with Egypt, can save the region and prevent chaos. Once they share a political position, they have an influence on major powers. \n \nWashington knows that Saudi Arabia has launched a war on terror and the Saudi security forces’ success confirm Riyadh’s role. Only a few days ago, it arrested Ahmad Al-Mughassil, the mastermind behind the 1996 Alkhobar attacks. \n \nThe Kingdom also provided important information to the US that foiled a possible suicide attack in a plane flying over Detroit in 2009. It also uncovered the presence of a bomb hidden in an ink container on a plane bound for Chicago in October 2010. Apart from intelligence and security cooperation, the US knows that Saudi Arabia has paid the price for its own safety and security in its fight against terror. \n \nThe interlinked interests of the two countries make it difficult to put Saudi-US relations at risk. Economically, American companies have enormous investments in the Kingdom while Riyadh has huge deposits and investments in the US. Many senior Saudi officials graduated from American universities and there are currently 120,000 Saudi students studying in the US. \n \nIn the context of what I have outlined, certain disagreements between the two countries are expected but their shared interests are stronger and dwarf the differences. It is important to concentrate on, and develop, this relationship for the benefit of both Saudi Arabia and the entire region with all its issues.
7e859c86-8e2a-4e8f-9e57-f90c725487ce	Shaker Aamer, the last British resident held at Guantanamo Bay, is to be released, a British Government spokesman said. \n \nThe US government has notified the UK authorities that it now intends to return Mr Aamer to Britain. \n \n"The Government has regularly raised Mr Aamer's case with the US authorities and we support President (Barack) Obama's commitment to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay," the spokesman said. \n \n"In terms of next steps, we understand that the US Government has notified Congress of this decision and once that notice period has been concluded, Mr Aamer will be returned to the UK." \n \nMr Aamer, 46, a Saudi national, was originally detained in Afghanistan in 2001. \n \nHe was subsequently transferred to Guantanamo Bay where he has been held without charge. \n \nHis release is expected to take place once the 30 day notice period set by the US authorities has expired \n \nMr Aamer has been the subject of a long campaign to secure his release. Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said the news of his return was a "huge relief". \n \n"In the past Mr Aamer has reportedly been at death's door during a hunger strike and his return to his family in Britain won't come a moment too soon," she said. \n \n"The immediate focus should now be on providing medical and other support for Mr Aamer on his return to the UK, but let's not forget that his 13-year ordeal at Guantanamo has been an absolute travesty of justice." \n \nConservative MP David Davis, who has repeatedly called for Mr Aamer's release, said it was "great news". \n \nHe told the Press Association: "It is long overdue. It should have happened years ago - 13 years without having been charged with or indeed accused of any crime. \n \n"It is brilliant news for his family, who are British citizens, very good news for him and good news for justice. \n   Promoted stories   \n"I would like to give my commendation to the large number of people who have campaigned year in and year out for Shaker Aamer's release. For them this is a very great vindication." \n \nMr Davis said the process of releasing those held in the facility has been "pretty painful for the American government". \n \nHe said: "Let's hope (Mr Aamer's release) is implemented as quickly as humanly possible." \n \nSuccessive British governments have pursued a policy of pressing for the release of UK nationals and residents held by the US at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility on Cuba. \n \nDavid Cameron raised Mr Aamer's case with Mr Obama when they met in January and the decision to return him to the UK him was discussed by the two leaders again in a phone call on Thursday. \n \nOfficials would not discuss under what conditions he was being released. \n \nHowever, it is thought Mr Aamer - who described as a "close associate of Osama Bin Laden" who fought in the battle of Tora Bora in US files obtained by the WikiLeaks website - will be subject to monitoring by the security services on his return. \n \nThe Government spokesman said: "As the US has said, we have one of the most robust and effective systems in the world to deal with suspected terrorists and those suspected of engaging in terrorist related activity and we will continue to do all we can to protect people in Britain and around the world from the threat of terrorism." \n   \n Share article  \n   \nA senior US defence official said the final decision to return Mr Aamer to the UK had been approved by US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter. \n \nThe move was said to have followed a "thorough review of his case and taking into consideration the robust security assurances that will be provided by the British government, one of our strongest allies who has supported our efforts to close the detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay".
d4e350f6-680e-47e9-b929-3c7ed766267b	OAKLAND, Calif -- Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala revealed Monday that he received knee injections in Germany over the offseason. \n\nIguodala, 31, engaged in a treatment meant to ease joint soreness, but he did not elaborate on whether the treatment was the same as the orthokine shots that Kobe Bryant received annually in Germany. \n\n"My knees feel really good," Iguodala said Monday at Warriors Media Day of the procedure's effects. "I've been dunking a lot lately, which I normally don't do in the offseason." \n\nIguodala also joked that Warriors coach Steve Kerr "looked dead" after undergoing back surgery and said of his teammate Harrison Barnes' upcoming contract, "Harrison's number is so large, it doesn't matter. Rich is rich."
22b8e3aa-9046-437c-9cb4-ad3a10c5b144	Principal Jerry Mayes with a group of students. Photo courtesy of Erin Woggon. \n \nThe principal’s office at duPont Manual High School is a place of distinction. It’s no secret the school is among the nation’s best. \n \nIn that office, Jerry Mayes effuses a palpable ambition. But in an apparent paradox, his most salient quality is humility. \n \n“I take what we do seriously,” he says, “but I don’t take myself very seriously.” \n \nWhen Mayes recounts his journey to the prestigious post, he makes scant mention of the attainments that landed him there. The principal himself seems mystified, being loath to own that his merits indeed commended him for the job. \n \n“What’re the chances of me, out of a nationwide search, becoming the principal of Manual High School? I just feel like for some reason I’m supposed to be here. I don’t know.” \n \nGrowing up in Louisville, Mayes wasn’t into sports – which is ironic, considering that he’d go on to become a football coach. His mother, who’d been among the second co-ed class to graduate from Manual, gave him a compulsory introduction to the sport. \n \n“When we went to the Manual-Male football games, I really didn’t know what was going on,” he recalls. “But I knew every Thanksgiving, I had to go to this game or we weren’t eating Thanksgiving dinner.” \n \nWhen Mayes was in the seventh grade, his parents divorced. “This guy by the name of Milon Perpich became my surrogate father, basically, and all I wanted to do was spend time with him,” he remembers. “And in order to spend time with him, I had to learn how to play sports.” \n \nMayes graduated from Butler Traditional High School then earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Morehead and UofL, respectively. \n \nHe took his first teaching job at Paul Blazer High School in Ashland, Ky., where he worked for two years. Then, he moved to St. Xavier High School, where he taught and coached football for about four years. \n \nAfter that, he accepted a coaching position at Morehead. A few years later, he was back in Louisville at Doss High School, and after that, he returned to St. Xavier as athletic director. \n \n“Then, I had the itch to get back into coaching,” he says. So he took a job as head football coach and advanced biology teacher at Manual. He subsequently became an assistant principal at Pleasure Ridge Park High School, where he spent 10 years. And in fall 2013, he became principal at duPont Manual High School. \n \nWithout question, it’s a station of honor. U.S. News and World Report ranked Manual No. 205 in its most current list of America’s best high schools and the second best high school in Kentucky. Niche.com placed it at No. 112 nationally and best in the state. And on TheBestSchools.org, the school came in at No. 45 in the U.S. \n \n“We have great schools all over Jefferson County,” Mayes says, “and each one of them serves a certain purpose. Ours just happens to be this unique set of kids who want to be in a very rigorous setting. I have the hardest working kids in town – no question.” \n \nLast year, Manual’s students earned $63 million in scholarships. The school offers 30 advanced placement courses, meaning students can graduate with as much as two years of college credit. \n \n“We take ownership of every kid in this building,” Mayes says. \n \nManual boasts exceptionally gifted teachers who regularly meet to discuss their students’ development. “I’m the smallest cog in this wheel,” Mayes says. “I really am. And that’s not some false humility. My biggest thing is to stay out of the way and let these guys do their job.” \n \nManual has a rich tradition of success, and Mayes preaches it to the freshmen: “When you come in here, understand this is a different cat.” As Mayes speaks, he taps the table repeatedly for emphasis. “… You have to accept carrying the torch for the hundreds of alumni that have gone before you.” \n \nManual is also rich in socioeconomic diversity. Minorities make up more than a third of its student body. The environment feels a lot like home to Mayes, whose daughters – 23, 20, 17 and 10 – are all adopted. \n \nHis wife, Marla Mayes, is a real estate agent with Breland Group Realtors. “My wife is phenomenal,” he says. “… She actually pushed me to go for this position and to do this.” \n \nThe statement is illustrative of Mayes’ career, even his personal life – he’s an unassuming man with a record of responding with mastery to a good push. \n \nMayes turns around the yellow notepad where he’s prepared his comments. Across the top he’s written: “May this be to your glory.” \n \nMayes doesn’t typically grant interviews, but he’s welcomed this one in the spirit that perhaps his story will inspire someone. “I really lean on my faith,” he says. “… That’s my base. That’s where everything comes from.” \n \nIt’s a faith that God makes everything happen for a reason, which is the only way Mayes feels comfortable accounting for his success. \n \n“Out of the blue, after a nationwide search, how do you explain that I end up being at one of the greatest places on earth?” VT \n      About the Author  Wesley Kerrick  Read more articles by this author >
7651091d-e1a3-43c7-a103-e086ee664a33	(CNN) – Following the tradition of previous presidential spouses, first lady Michelle Obama is prepared to share her advice with the next first lady or first gentleman. \n\nObama dropped in on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on Monday night, taking a break from the action at the United Nations to promote her “Let Girls Learn” campaign and joke with the host about state dinners and the next first family who could occupy the White House. \n\nColbert highlighted a letter to Obama by former first lady Laura Bush upon leaving the White House, asking, “Without naming names, if we have a female president next, would you leave a letter for her husband? What would you say? What’s the thing he needs to know more than anything else about the job?” \n\nObama replied, “I would say, follow your passion, just be you.” \n\nWithout missing a beat, Colbert made an apparent jab at Bill Clinton, saying “I think he does,” prompting a big laugh from the audience. \n\nWhile Obama protested, “That wasn’t me! I didn’t say it,” Colbert added, “I have never met Carly Fiorina’s husband, but I imagine he’s a lovely man.” \n\nWith the White House recently wrapping up a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping, Colbert took the opportunity to prod Obama about not getting an invitation to the high-profile state dinner held last Friday. Colbert, who attended a previous state dinner for French President Francois Hollande, quipped, “Haven’t heard from you much since then. You just had one with the Chinese president, didn’t get the call.” \n\nColbert also turned the conversation to Obama’s international campaign for education equality, which the White House touts as “a government-wide effort that will leverage the investments we have made and success we have achieved in global primary school and expand them to help adolescent girls complete their education.” \n\nColbert highlighted his own advocacy on the issue at the Global Citizens Festival in New York, cracking, “My issue for that weekend was girls’ education around the world, and I’m not saying you’re kind of jumping on my thing, but you are here to talk about ‘Let Girls learn.’ OK.”
9e37c76e-f90a-4670-a914-99517c376783	Posted:  Monday, September 28, 2015, 1:24 PM    \n \nBy Emily Flitter \n \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday unveiled sweeping proposals to simplify the tax code, slash the corporate tax rate and impose a one-time levy on the overseas earnings of U.S. companies. \n \nIn a news conference at Trump Tower in Manhattan, he also vowed to eliminate deductions and loopholes for special interest groups if he becomes president at the November 2016 election. \n \n"It's a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again," Trump said, promising "major tax relief for middle income and most other Americans." \n   \nAlthough himself a billionaire entrepreneur, Trump is more willing than other Republicans to use anti-corporate rhetoric. \n \nThe real estate mogul said he would solve a longstanding problem with offshore profits that U.S. companies park abroad, estimated by experts to be worth at least $2.3 trillion. \n \nTrump suggested a one-off 10 percent tax on U.S. companies' profits held abroad whether they are repatriated or not. \n \n"Everybody agrees it should come back, Republicans, Democrats," he said. "The reason companies aren't bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn't make sense to bring it back," he said. The current tax rate for repatriated profits is 35 percent. \n \nTrump's plan on taxing overseas profits resembles proposals put forward by President Barack Obama and two senior senators, Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York and Republican Rob Portman of Ohio. \n \nTrump also said he would cap the tax rate for all businesses at 15 percent, compared to the present 35-percent top corporate rate. He vowed to eliminate the so-called death tax, formally known as the estate tax, and get rid of the "carried interest" loophole that lets private equity and hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than other people. \n \nHe also promised to simplify voters' tax returns by reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals to four from seven. \n \n(Writing by Alistair Bell; Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Bill Rigby)
225b7339-cfa8-4801-be39-bc1631ecf7de	When your child is sick and needs a prescription medication , you need to know the correct dosage, how often to give it, if it should be taken with a meal and of course, the side effects .   \n \nYet, you probably never give much thought to what is actually in the medication and how it’s prepared. What may surprise you is that prescriptions can actually be customized for your child with a technology known as compounding. \n \nFind out what compound pharmaceuticals are, how they can help your child get well and what you need to do to make sure they’re safe. \n \nWhat are compound pharmaceuticals? \nUnlike medications from pharmaceutical manufacturers which are formulated only one way, compound pharmaceuticals use the same pure, active chemicals that are in FDA-approved medications and customize them so they are specifically suited for the patient. \n \nFifty years ago, most prescription medications in the U.S. were compounded but as drug manufacturers started to make more medications that could help the general population, compounding became less common. \n \nYet since the 1980s, studies have shown that about 5 percent of patients of all ages were not having their needs met by commercial medications. Since most pharmacies fill 400 prescriptions per day, on average, there has been a growing need. \n  More on this...   \n“That’s 20 patients a day per pharmacy where their needs are not being met or they’re not being met the way they could be because the medication isn’t customized for them,” said Scott Karolchyk, vice president of formulations for QmedRx in Maitland, Flo. \n \nToday, the majority of medications for kids are compounded, especially those given to children in cardiology and neonatal departments in hospitals, Karolchyk said.   \n \nA compound pharmacy can change the concentration or dosage, make a suspension liquid or add a flavor to make it more palatable. It can also help a child who needs a specific medication that is currently unavailable or off the market. \n \nFor example, a compound pharmacy can work with the doctor to ensure that infants who are sensitive to a medication that contain several drugs  are treated with a medication that has minimal side effects, Karolchyk said. \n \nLikewise, a compound pharmacy can create a unique concoction by mixing two types of creams together for a skin condition, for example. A medication can also be reformulated to exclude an ingredient like gluten or a dye that a child is allergic or that a child can’t tolerate because of side effects. \n \nIs compounding safe? \nThere have been concerns in recent years about the safety of compounding pharmacies after a 2012 incident where 750 people developed fungal meningitis or other infections and 64 died from contaminated steroids dispensed by the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. \n \n“They were essentially acting as a manufacturer under the disguise of a compounder so it was total neglect and certainly not a fair representation of the average compounder who genuinely cares about the patients,” said Blake Powers, chief operating officer for QmedRx. \n\nUnlike drug manufacturers who are regulated by the FDA, the compound pharmaceutical industry is regulated by individual states. Nevertheless, there are strict guidelines including two key standards that compounding pharmacies must follow. One is the United States Pharmacopeia for both sterile and non-sterile preparations and the other is “good compounding practices,” or rules and regulations that all states follow. \n \nIn 2013, President Obama signed the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) into law. Under the law, compounding pharmacies are encouraged to register with the FDA. Once they do, they are classified as outsourcing facilities so they can sell bulk drugs to hospitals and healthcare centers for what’s known as “office use.” These pharmacies will also be subject to the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations and inspections by the FDA. \n \nYet since the registration is voluntary, not all pharmacies will be regulated by the FDA. \n \n“The medical community’s hope is that it will become more and more safe as compounding pharmacies are treated like manufacturers,” Dr. Carlo Reyes, an emergency medicine physician and pediatrician at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, Calif. \n \nWhat you need to know \nIf your child is prescribed a medication, ask your pediatrician if the medicine is necessary in that particular formulation. Also, if the only thing that is being changed is the flavor, find out if there is a way to make the medication more palatable without using a compound pharmacy. \n \nIt’s also a good idea to check with your insurance company because some may not cover the medication or have stipulations about the specific formulation. \n \nYour doctor may have a relationship with a compounding pharmacy or may hand you the prescription and let you find one yourself. Either way, ask your pharmacist if they have had problems with the compounding pharmacy. You can also check the FDA’s website for inspections and recalls. \n \nTo find a reputable compounding pharmacy in your area, search the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists and look for a pharmacy that holds accreditation from the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB), which only 2 percent do. \n \n“It proves that they are meeting or exceeding all the compounding standards and regulations to ensure that their products are quality and that they’re safe,” Karolchyk said. \n\nJulie Revelant is a health journalist and a consultant who provides content marketing and copywriting services for the healthcare industry.

3754f5d1-4e7c-4f58-a426-14a1ddee3775	Outgoing House Speaker John A. Boehner, in his first one-on-one interview since announcing his resignation last week, compared conservative hard-liners in his party to biblical "false prophets" who promise more than they can deliver. \n \nBoehner announced Friday that he would step down Oct. 30 after nearly five years as speaker amid constant pressure from his party's right flank. Asked Sunday by host John Dickerson on a live broadcast of CBS's "Face the Nation" whether those hard-liners are "unrealistic about what can be done in government," Boehner exploded. \n \n"Absolutely, they're unrealistic!" he said. "But, you know, the Bible says beware of false prophets, and there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done." \n \nBoehner referred, as he has in the past, to the ill-fated 2013 shutdown over funding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare: "This plan never had a chance," he said, but he blamed outside forces for leading Republicans down an ill-advised path: "We got groups here in town, members of the House and Senate here in town, who whip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know — they know! — are never going to happen." \n \nDickerson followed up by asking whether Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), the leading proponent of the 2013 shutdown, was a "false prophet." \n \n"Listen, you can pick a lot of names out; I'll let you choose 'em," Boehner said as he sipped from a coffee mug. He added: "I refer you to my remark at a fundraiser I made in August in Steamboat Springs, Colo." — a reference to a report, published in the Daily Caller , that he had called Cruz a "jackass" behind closed doors. \n \nEarlier Sunday, the leader of one of those outside groups who have pushed for greater confrontation cheered Boehner's departure. Michael Needham, chief executive of Heritage Action for America, said on Fox News Sunday that Boehner and his allies treated conservatives as "crazies" to be marginalized, not as central players in developing the party agenda. \n \n"[Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi does not talk about her base that way; Barack Obama doesn't think about his base that way," Needham said. "We need a Republican leadership that is showing conservative values. ... That's not what we've had. We've had to fight our own speaker." \n \nBoehner addressed the remaining five weeks of his speakership, in which he pledged to "get as much finished as possible." Pressing matters include striking a deal with President Obama to keep the government open through the coming fiscal year, raising the federal borrowing limit, passing a long-term transportation bill and extending popular tax breaks. \n \n[ Congressional agenda thrown into disorder with Boehner's departure ] \n \n"I don't want to leave my successor a dirty barn," Boehner said. "So I want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets here." \n \nOn Friday, he offered words of support for Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as a successor. He did not mention McCarthy on Sunday but offered advice to whoever follows him in the speaker's chair: "Have the courage to do what you can do. ... Just go do it." \n \n"In our system of government, it's not about Hail Mary passes; it's the Woody Hayes school of football," he said, referring to the legendary Ohio State University coach. "Three years and a cloud of dust. It's a slow, methodical process." \n \nMike DeBonis covers Congress and national politics for The Washington Post. He previously covered D.C. politics and government from 2007 to 2

Make safety in your workplace a priority. You should have a fire extinguisher and smoke detector in there. \n \nYou should think about what you use in your own life when you decide on a product that your work from home business will market and sell. Figuring out what consumers need is the most important step in choosing a product to sell. If you have noticed a specific need for a certain product, you can be sure that others have experienced that need as well. \n \nTIP! Set up a place in your home that you can designate as your work space. Make sure that your work space has room to organize the supplies you need. \n \nThe first thing you need to do when starting up your home business enterprise is to sign-up for a new PO Box. Don’t put your home address on the Internet if you don’t have to. You’ll be protected from people who might not have proper intentions. \n \nTIP! Promoting your business is the only way to get it out in the open. If you’re speaking with someone and they say something related to your business, start talking about it. \n \nTry to find the average market price before you sell something. This clues you in on what customers are willing to pay for your product or service. Look at your competitors’ prices so you can offer your product at a slightly cheaper cost.

If you are including a web site, research how your target audience likes to interact with online options, and design the site accordingly. \n \nTIP! In business, spend 20% of your time learning, and the other 80% of your time doing. Doing means making money, so whatever your business might be, you need to be actually creating, calling, emailing, whatever actions you must take to bring in income. \n \nTalk to a lawyer before starting your work at work from home business. Many states have laws pertaining to home businesses. By contacting a business lawyer, you will be able to find out what your state laws are and make sure that you are following them so that you do not get into trouble with the state. \n \nTIP! Advertising by word of mouth is cheap and can be one of the best ways to advertise a business. People are more likely to try businesses their friends recommend rather than those advertised by strangers. \n \nMake sure your website it memorable and eye catching. Choosing a domain name that is very long or too hard to recall can make potential customers forget it. Keep it simple — and keep it catchy — when making a domain name. \n \nTIP!

Make sure you stay on top of record keeping so you can get the most out of your tax deductions and also to help if you are audited. \n \nTIP! Manage time effectively. Businesses from home need much of your time, because you lack a staff to handle small tasks. \n \nHome businesses need to have a website in today’s world. If not, this is a grave oversight in today’s digital world! Be certain to have a relevant domain name and quality content. \n \nTIP! Entertaining your clients could allow you to write off more money on your taxes. You can deduct expenses, like taking clients out to eat, on your taxes. \n \nOne tip for you is to ensure that your site can take sales. This is significant because many like to shop on the Internet; if you cannot accommodate this, you will lose many sales. \n \nTIP! Continue to maintain a regular schedule when working from home.

You can write this off, which is good considering how many miles can add up. This can be a pretty large write off. \n \nTIP! Don’t try running an home-based business without out-of-pocket expenditures. While many home business resources are available at no cost, there are also services you may need occasionally that you will be required to pay for. \n \nStart a business about something you are experienced in. Many people make the mistake of thinking they can learn what to do as they’re working on their business. This is possible in rare cases, but most people fail by doing that.
