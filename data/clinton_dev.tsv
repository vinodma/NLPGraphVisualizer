C05770166	Top 2 Civilians Face Rockiness in Afghan Shift By MARK LANDLER The New York Times Thu, July 1, 2010 WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together. Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career- ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine. But privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support, these people said. In recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement. Prior to General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one said, \There are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\ But the White House believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said. \You cant have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,\ said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign. Be General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together. \Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,\ General Petraeus said in an interview. \We have had, and do have, a very good relationship.\ That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry. Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagons proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the true architect of the plan. The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has Masters degrees from Harvard and Stanford. While they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces. General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of endless Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrookes current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an economy. These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan governments campaign to reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society. Mr. Karzais longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrookes negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeuss influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad. On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrookes past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistans ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistans concerns. \Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who may not like him,\ Mr. Haqqani said. Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target. Mr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.

C05768731	I have asked Jose to get you a more detailed report but I.must tell you the opening of the USA Pavilion has been a great success so far - at least among the expo-goers. A few vignettes. - while we dont want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles). Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit. -the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion. Fair-goers stand in line to have their photos taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message. - the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin is met w howls of laughter and Act ll called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photos when you and President come on the screen. - we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and the bison stuffed animals - who knew? Anyway, thght ud enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted. Smart power works!

C05770115	Lowey to Remove Assistance for Afghanistan From Foreign Aid Bill Chairwoman Announces Oversight Hearings on Corruption in Afghanistan WASHINGTON — In light of two troubling news reports on corruption within the Afghan government, Congresswoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), Chairwoman of the Appropriations State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee, today announced she is removing funding for Afghanistan beyond humanitarian aid from her 2011 bill scheduled for markup this week. \The alleged shipment of billions in donor funds out of Afghanistan and allegations of Afghan government insiders impeding corruption investigations are outrageous,\ said Lowey. \I do not intend to appropriate one more dime for assistance to Afghanistan until I have confidence that U.S. taxpayer money is not being abused to line the pockets of corrupt Afghan government officials, drug lords, and terrorists. Furthermore, the government of Afghanistan must demonstrate that corruption is being aggressively investigated and prosecuted. \Rampant corruption fosters the conditions that threaten the security of our troops and the stability of the Afghan government and economy.\ The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its Fiscal Year 2011 Appropriations Act on Wednesday June 30th. The subcommittee will not consider any bilateral assistance for the Afghan government other than lifesaving humanitarian aid at this time. Lowey also announced the Subcommittee will hold oversight hearings after the July 4th recess to get to the bottom of these allegations. \Too many Americans are suffering in this economy for us to put their hard-earned tax dollars into the hands of criminals overseas,\ said Lowey. \We will not commit billions more in taxpayer money for Afghanistan until there are assurances that such funds will be used for their intended purposes and that the government of Afghanistan is willing and able to root corruption within its ranks. U.S. taxpayers deserve nothing less.\

C05772490	Heres some background: This piece is for a year-ending look-ahead issue of The Economist and we were asked to write about Americas priorities and place in the world in 2011, ten years after 9/11 and twenty years after the end of the Cold War. The team (Jake, Josh, Anne-Marie, Derek) felt that this was a good opportunity to pull together for a wide audience some of the key themes you sounded in Krakow and elsewhere, and build on the Presidents call to action at UNGA. We dont say anything new here, its true, but the idea was to lay down another marker that these are issues that are important to you and to the administration.

C05739704	Here is Susan on this week. She wasn't asked about whether we had any intel. But she did make clear our view that this started spontaneously and then evolved. The only troubling sentence relates to the investigation, specifically: And we'll see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances.\ But she got pushed there. Waiting on other transcripts. For more on what happened and why, lets bring in the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Susan Rice. Dr. Rice, thank you for joining us. RICE: Good to be with you, Jake. TAPPER: So, first of all, what is the latest you can tell us on who these attackers were at the embassy or at the consulate in Benghazi? Were hearing that the Libyans have arrested people. Theyre saying that some people involved were from outside the country, that there might have even been Al Qaida ties. Whats the latest information? RICE: Well, Jake, first of all, its important to know that theres an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed. That will tell us with certainty what transpired. But our current best assessment, based on the information that we have at present, is that, in fact, what this began as, it was a spontaneous -- not a premeditated -- response to what had transpired in Cairo. In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate, rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that as you know in -- in the wake of the revolution in Libya are -- are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739704 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Well wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but thats the best information we have at present. TAPPER: Why was there such a security breakdown? Why was there not better security at the compound in Benghazi? Why were there not U.S. Marines at the embassy in Tripoli? RICE: Well, first of all, we had a substantial security presence with our personnel... TAPPER: Not substantial enough, though, right? RICE: ... with our personnel and the consulate in Benghazi. Tragically, two of the four Americans who were killed were there providing security. That was their function. And indeed, there were many other colleagues who were doing the same with them. It obviously didnt prove sufficient to the -- the nature of the attack and sufficient in that -- in that moment. And thats why, obviously, we have reinforced our remaining presence in Tripoli and why the president has very -- been very clear that in Libya and throughout the region we are going to call on the governments, first of all, to assume their responsibilities to protect our facilities and our personnel, and were reinforcing our facilities and our -- our embassies where possible... TAPPER: But why... RICE: ... and where needed. TAPPER: Why would we not have Marines at the embassy in Tripoli to begin with? It would seem like this -- this is obviously an unstable country. This is a region where U.S. interests have been attacked in previous months. Why were there not Marines there to begin with? RICE: First of all, there are Marines in some places around the world. There are not Marines in every facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements. Our presence in Tripoli, as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. Weve been back post-revolution only for a matter of months. But Ive visited there myself, both to Tripoli and Benghazi. I was very grateful to have a strong security presence with me as part of our -- our embassy detachment there. So we certainly are aware that Libya is a place where there have been increasingly some violent incidents. The security personnel that the State Department thought were required were in place. And well see when the investigation unfolds whether what was -- what transpired in Benghazi might have unfolded differently in different circumstances. But the president has been very clear. The protection of American personnel and facilities is and will remain our top priority. Thats why weve reinforced our presence in Tripoli and elsewhere.

And President Obama pledged to repair Americas relationships with the Muslim world. Why does the U.S. seem so impotent? And why is the U.S. even less popular today in some of these Muslim and Arab countries than it was four years ago? RICE: Jake, were not impotent. Were not even less popular, to challenge that assessment. I dont know on what basis you make that judgment. But let me -- let me point... TAPPER: It just seems that the U.S. government is powerless as this -- as this maelstrom erupts. RICE: Its actually the opposite. First of all, lets be clear about what transpired here. What happened this week in Cairo, in Benghazi, in many other parts of the region... TAPPER: Tunisia, Khartoum... RICE: ... was a result a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated, that the U.S. government had nothing to do with, which we have made clear is reprehensible and disgusting. We have also been very clear in saying that there is no excuse for violence, there is -- that we have condemned it in the strongest possible terms. But lets look at whats happened. Its quite the opposite of being impotent. We have worked with the governments in Egypt. President Obama picked up the phone and talked to President Morsi in Egypt. And as soon as he did that, the security provided to our personnel in our embassies dramatically increased. President Morsi... TAPPER: It took two days for President Morsi to say anything about this. RICE: President Morsi has been out repeatedly and said that he condemns this violence. Hes called off -- and his people have called off any further demonstrations and have made very clear that this has to stop. (CROSSTALK) RICE: Now, and and same, frankly, in Tunisia, in Yemen, and, of course, in Libya, where the government has -- has gone out of its way to try to step up security and express deepest remorse for what has happened. We are quite popular in Libya, as you might expect, having been a major partner in their revolution. What transpired outside of our consulate in Benghazi was not an expression of deep-seated anti-Americanism on the part of the Libyan people. Quite the contrary. The counter-demonstrations, the outpouring of sympathy and support for Ambassador Stevens and for the United States, the government of Libya and -- and the people on the street saying how pained they are by this, is much more a reflection of the sentiment towards the United States than a small handful of heavily armed mobsters.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. TAPPER: That certainly, according to polling, is the case in Libya. Not the case in Egypt. And since you brought up President Morsi, let me try to get some clarification on something. President Obama was asked about the relationship with Egypt on Wednesday, and this is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: I dont think that we would consider them an ally, but we dont consider them an enemy. They are a new government that is trying to find its way. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: The United States has sent billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer money to Egypt over the last few decades. And by definition, as you know, according to the State Department, Egypt is a major non-NATO ally of the United States. Why would President Obama say Egypt is not an ally? RICE: Well, first of all, the president has been very clear and -- and everybody understands that Egypt is a very critical partner of the United States, has long been so. That relationship remains the same, and the president wasnt signaling any change in -- in the nature... TAPPER: Was he trying to nudge Morsi? RICE: The president wasnt signaling any change in the nature of our relationship. Obviously, the president had a conversation with President Morsi and a very productive one, in which he underscored that its, of course, the responsibility of the Egyptian government as host to protect diplomatic personnel and facilities, including our own, and we saw that President Morsi, immediately after that, took dramatic steps to improve the security of our facilities in Cairo and elsewhere, and then went out and repeatedly made a number of very important and powerful statements condemning the violence and conveying the message that, however hateful such a video may be, there is absolutely no justification for violence against the United States or other Western partners. So what weve seen is that the president has been incredibly calm, incredibly steady, and incredibly measured in his approach to this set of developments. And his interventions, his leadership has ensured that in Egypt, in Yemen, in Tunisia, in Libya, and many other parts of the world, that leaders have come out and made very plain that theres no excuse for this violence. We heard Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey say the same, we heard the Grand Mufti in Saudi Arabia say the same, that theres no excuse for violence, that violence is to be condemned, and that governments have a responsibility to protect United States personnel and facilities and those of all foreign diplomats. TAPPER: I know you have to go, but very quickly, was the president in that interview trying to nudge President Morsi, \Get your act together\?

C05739737	The whole thing is worth a read, but a very tough judge gives you and the President credit: By any standard of reason, President Obama and Secretary of State Canton conducted themselves very well amid the confusion and crises Of course they didnt do everything perfectly; for example, some unidentified administration official disowned the embassy statement condemning the video. Such creepiness served only to make it look like Obama was running for cover at the expense of our embattled diplomats. But minor miscues aside, Obama and Clinton nailed the main points, especially Clinton. In her first statement soon after the riots, here s what she said The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\ http://vvvvw.thedailybeast.corniarticles/2012/09/17/leslie-h-eelb-on-the-mvsteries-of-the-middle-east-riots.html U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739737 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

C05739876	Secretary Clinton's leadership on Libya HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings — as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime. February 25— HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington. February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of the embassy. February 26 -- HRC made a series of calls to her counterparts to help secure passage of UNSC 1970, which imposes sanctions on Gaddafi and his family and refers Qadhafi and his cronies to the ICC February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She gives a major address in which she says: \Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go — now, without further violence or delay.\ She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership in the Human Rights Council. Early March — HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi March 14— HRC travels to Paris for the G8 foreign minister's meeting. She meets with INC representative Jibril and consults with her colleagues on further UN Security Council action. She notes that a no-fly zone will not be adequate. B6 B5 March 14-16 — HRC participates in a series of high-level video- and teleconferences She is a leading voice for strong UNSC action and a NATO civilian protection mission. March 17 —HRC secures Russian abstention and Portuguese and African support for UNSC 1973, ensuring that it passes. 1973 authorizes a no-fly zone over Libya and \all necessary measures\ - code for military action - to protect civilians against Gaddafi's army. March 19— HRC travels to Paris to meet with European and Arab leaders to prepare for military action to protect civilians. That night, the first U.S. air strikes halt the advance of Gaddafi's forces on Benghazi and target Libya's air defenses. March 24— HRC engages with allies and secures the transition of command and control of the civilian protection mission to NATO. She announces the transition in a statement.

Over the course of several days, all three devote aircraft to the mission. March 29 — HRC travels to London for a conference on Libya, where she is a driving force behind the creation of a Contact Group comprising 20-plus countries to coordinate efforts to protect civilians and plan for a post-Qadhafi Libya. She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in. April 14 — HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a communiqué that calls for Qadhafi's departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access. May 5— HRC travels to Rome for a Contact Group meeting. The Contact Group establishes a coordination system and a temporary financial mechanism to funnel money to the TNC. June 8 — HRC travels to Abu Dhabi for another Contact Group meeting and holds a series of intense discussions with rebel leaders.

Late June — HRC meets with House Democrats and Senate Republicans to persuade them not to de-fund the Libya operation. July 15 — HRC travels to Istanbul and announces that the U.S. recognizes the TNC as the legitimate government of Libya. She also secures recognition from the other members of the Contact Group. July 16— HRC sends Feltman, Cretz, and Chollet to Tunis to meet with Qadhafi envoys \to deliver a clear and firm message that the only way to move forward, is for Qadhafi to step down\. Early August — HRC works to construct a $1.5 billion assets package to be approved by the Security Council and sent to the TNC. That package is working through its last hurdles. Early August After military chief Abdel Fattah Younes is killed, S sends a personal message to TNC head Jalil to press for a responsible investigation and a careful and inclusive approach to creating a new executive council. Early August HRC secures written pledges from the TNC to an inclusive, pluralistic democratic transition. She continues to consult with European and Arab colleagues on the evolving situation.

Sid Or I could send the endless pieces on Obama and his troubles or Haaretz on the new negotiations. I'll skip the torrent of Obama pieces (see Politico lead piece today, if you want to catch the full updraft of new conventional wisdom), but include Haaretz below from its editorial editor and Teddy Kollek's former spokesman: • Home • Print Edition • News • Published 01:58 23.08.10 • Latest update 01:58 23.08.10 ith a victory like this.. The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have preconditions - dictated by Israel. By At.tiye Elder: Tags: Israel news M:ddist East peace Two years ago, a basketball tournament was held at Tel Aviv University with the participation of student teams from 14 cOuntries, including a Palestinian team from the occupied territories. The games were purportedly held \without preconditions,\ and every team put its best players on the court and aimed to win. But unsurprisingly, the Shin Ben security service permitted only seven Palestinian players, including bench players, to enter Israel. Some of the key players on the team were compelled to stay at home. After several losses (by 30 to 40 points), when it was the Palestinians turn to face a team from one of the Israeli colleges, their coach announced that he had decided to spare his players another humiliation, and requested that the game be canceled. The illuminating movie \Friendship Games,\ to be shown tonight on the Yes Docu channel (directed by Ram Levy, along with Ibtisam IVIara'ana, Duki Dror and Yoav Shamir), documents the tournament, which was the initiative of Ed Peskowitz, an American Jew and co-owner of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team in the NBA. The camera follows the Israeli coach to the Palestinian locker room. After a long while, he tells his players that in order to even out the teams, two of them will join the other side. He tells two of the Israeli bench players, including one known as Fats(); to don the shirts of the Palestinian team. The game ends with a decisive victory for the Israeli team and a strong sense of missed opportunity.. The direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, like the basketball game, have preconditions. Not the conditions demanded by the Palestinians, but conditions dictated by Israel. The refusal to freeze Israeli building in East Jerusalem is a precondition, just like the demand to freeze it. The refusal to resume negotiations from the point where talks between the previous prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas left off after the Annapolis conference is no less a precondition than the demand to resume talks from square one. The head referee, the president of the United States, has twisted the arms of his colleagues in the Quartet and is dragging Abbas to Washington. Barack °barna decided that the negotiations will be held without any commitment regarding building in East Jerusalem, and will be opened without even a declaration of principles stating that the talks will be held on the basis of a general formula, like peace and security for Israel and a state along the 1967 borders for the Palestinians. It's time to jump into the fountain in Rabin Square and cheer: The Palestinians have been shafted! If Benjamin Netanyahu's aim is to play around as much as possible with the ball, and sometimes kick the opponent, then he can really chalk up another victory. But Israel's success in the negotiations, like the success of the student team in the tournament, is not measured by the terms \victory\ or \defeat.\ What is victory over a weak Palestinian team worth, if it was won in friendly games that ended with virtually no interaction between the participants? What is a political process with the Palestinians worth if it erodes Abbas' standing and leads nowhere? What have we to gain from humiliating our partner before his constituency on the way to the negotiating table? If Israel's approach on every one of the core issues is that winning is everything, there's no point in bothering so many VIPs with another unnecessary summit. Let's assume that we'll succeed, with the help of the Jewish power around Obama, to twist Abbas' arm some more and extract, for example, an agreement in which he concedes sovereignty over the Temple Mount. How many hours would such an agreement last? All we need is a few more \victories\ like the invitation to the launch of direct negotiations, \without preconditions,\ and we'll lose our last partners to a settlement that will prevent Israel from turning into an apartheid state or a Palestinian state (the binational model is a nightmare, as far as I'm concerned). What will we do if Abbas announces that he's had enough of losing in purportedly friendly games, and that he's decided the time has come to step down? Will we declare another victory and invite Hamas leader Khaled Meshal and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the party?

C05767821	FYI: Jan 12, 2010 » Mobile Home » Top Stories Inside the Reid eruption By Mike Allen & Glenn Thrush I 1/12/10 @ 12:19 AM EST Harry Reid isn't talkative. But the Senate majority leader chatted freely with the two disarmingly charming book authors who came to his office at the Capitol shortly after the 2008 election. They — and their tape recorder — were soaking in his reminiscences about the wild campaign that had turned a backbencher in his caucus into president of the United States. Reid wasn't on guard — perhaps because he'd been told by his staff that the meeting would be \off the record,\ according to a person with knowledge of the exchange. Although Reid is a master of the Senate's mysterious inside game, he's often botched the outside game because of what one colleague calls a \penchant for saying things without a filter.\ But Jim Manley, Reid's senior communications adviser, wasn't too worried as he and his boss sat down with John Heilemann of New York Magazine and Mark Halperin of Time magazine — two veteran reporters who were working on what their publisher had billed as \a sweeping, novelistic, and ultimately definitive portrait\ of the 2008 race. Like virtually every Washington political insider, Manley had a long and warm relationship with Halperin, the longtime political director for ABC News who once set conventional wisdom in Washington with \The Note.\ Maybe Reid and Manley — thinking back to their many candid exchanges over the years — simply assumed that Halperin wouldn't burn him or his boss. Or maybe he expected that Halperin would check back with him on any quotes he planned to use? Whatever they were thinking, they were wrong. Reid was talking about the reasons why, even though he had publicly professed neutrality in the vicious Democratic primaries of 2008, he had secretly encouraged then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama to challenge another member of his caucus, then-New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. And amid all the talk of Obama's oratorical gifts, he let slip something else: Obama could win the White House because he was a \light-skinned\ African-American \with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\ The authors write in \Game Change,\ published this weekend, that Reid had made the remark \privately.\ They did not say he had said it to them. As a chagrined Reid telephoned political allies in the Senate and civil rights community to shore up his support this weekend, he made it clear that he felt burned by the authors. In the book's\Authors Note,\ they wrote: \All of our interviews — from those with junior staffers to those with the candidates themselves — were conducted on a deep background basis, which means we agreed not to identify the subjects as sources in any way. We believed this was essential to eliciting the level of candor on which a book of this sort depends.\ Heilemann said on MSNBCs \Morning Joe\: \We had a very clear agreement with all those sources that our interviews would be on deep background.... Our ground rules are ... that we won't identify any of our sources as the sources of the material. But we said to them all very clearly that if they put themselves in scenes of the book, if they were uttering dialogue to people in the book in part of a scene, that we would identify them as the utterer of those words.\ Halperin added: \There's no one we talked to for the book who we burned in any way, or violated any agreement with.\ Manley, a Capitol Hill veteran who also had worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, had been responsible for monitoring the interview and dealing with issues arising from it. But he didnt tell anyone else in Reids inner circle about the inflammatory remarks their boss had made; because of his good relationship with the authors, he assumed that the quotes would never be made public — at least not without his knowing about it first. Manley declined comment on this story-- and wouldnt confirm if the interview took place. On Friday at 10 p.m. — half a year after the interview — The Atlantics Marc Ambinder e-mailed Reids staff with questions about a \light-skinned\ candidate without a \Negro dialect.\ In the second-guessing that followed, Capitol Hill veterans said there was no way that such inflammatory words from a Senate majority leader would remain off the record, even if that had been the arrangement. But because Manley had not sounded an internal alarm, he and the rest of the damage-control squad were caught flat- footed by Ambinders e-mail, several people close to the situation told POLITICO. \They could have had weeks to prepare for this or to try to convince Halperin not to run it,\ said a Democrat who participated in some of the damage control. Now the staff had been blindsided with a revelation that, if mishandled, could be politically fatal. Manley and other aides worked until 2 a.m. Saturday to draft Reids carefully written apology, which emphasized his record on African- American issues. \I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,\ the 90-word statement began. Later on Saturday, Manley helped lead a counteroffensive, calling White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, a friend from his days as communications director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to set up an apology call between Reid, at home in Searchlight, Nev., and Obama back in Washington. In a stunning \Statement by the President\ e-mailed to reporters at 3:55 p.m. Saturday, Obama said: \Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today.... As far as Im concerned, the book is closed.\ Relieved to have the president's solid backing, Reid's aides decided that their toughest challenge would be to prevent any prominent African-American Democrats from attacking Reid too harshly — or calling for his resignation. Reid's team correctly anticipated that Republicans would demand his head. Keeping that criticism from becoming a bipartisan drumbeat was the key. The team calculated that as long as the attacks looked like partisan shouting, Reid would benefit. Aides say their boss quickly understood the danger and spent much of Saturday working a call list of about 30 prominent African-Americans across the country. On the calls, he apologized for his words and argued that the book's main takeaway should be that he had quietly supported Obama over Clinton, long before those made his feelings public. Among those he called were the Rev. Al Sharpton; longtime civil rights leader Julian Bond; Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; political consultant and talk-show fixture Donna Brazile; House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.); Wade Henderson, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights; and Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington office. The extent of the damage to his already shaky reelection chances in Nevada won't be known until November. But by Monday, Reid believed the Washington storm was passing. From his home in New York, Sen. Chuck Schumer telephoned Reid in Nevada and offered to organize a letter of support from all the Democratic senators. Reid decided that was unnecessary. He had confidently concluded that for now, at least, he had won the inside game.

C05765277	I'm writing in the hope that when you're in Afghanistan you will be able to demonstrate in some public way your support for the Afghan women. There is much disillusionment over the aftermath of the elections and the ongoing violence. It would be a wonderful signal to the women that we do value the role that they are and must continue to play to move Afghanistan forward. Secondly, it would also be helpful because there is growing concern at home that the women are going to be abandoned. I have to meet with Sen. Casey tom'w, for example. He believes that the women are critical to stability and peace in Afghanistan and wants to discuss our commitment. Lastly, as Pres, Karzai is beginning to plan his cabinet, perhaps you could mention to him the need to bring in some of the talented and experienced women into his government. At our Shura meeting yesterday, we discussed upcoming ministerial positions. We, of course, have no guarantee that Karzai will listen, but his government would be a lot better if he tapped women and so many are highly qualified. Thanks.

C05772088	PVerveer Saturday, December 18, 2010 1:22 PM child marriage defeat The defeat of the Child Marriage bill, I fear, is a harbinger of what's to come. After passing the Senate unanimously, there was every expectation that it would fly through the House on suspension. How this too became an abortion issue is truly distressing. We have our work more than cut out for us. On another note, i ran into Ray and Shaista the other night. They were recently in Pakistan and stayed with Zardari the whole time. It might make sense for someone to brief Ray. Zardari considers him his informal ambassador to the US. z..L ;; ;•=r-i e forc,; e Posted: i7 Dec 2010 03:08 PM PS' Incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman ileana Ros-Lehtinen. (R-FL) defeated a bill Thursday evening that would have committed the United States to combating forced child marriages abroad, by invoking concerns about the legislation's cost and that funds could be uses to finance abortions. The episode highlights the tough road that the °barna administration will face in advancing its women's rights and foreign aid agenda during the next Congressional session. Non-governmental organizations, women's rights advocates, and. lawmakers from both parties spent years developing and lobbying for the \International Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2010,\ which the House failed to pass in a vote Thursday. The bill failed even though 241 Congressmen voted, for it and only 166 voted against, because House Speaker Nancy Petosi (D-CA) brought it up under \suspension of the rules.\ This procedure has the advantage of not allowing any amendments or changes to the bill, but carries the disadvantage of requiring two-thirds of the. votes for passage. ; Even still, supporters in both parties fully expected the bill to garner the 290 votes needed -- right up until the bill. failed. After all, it passed the Senate unanimously Dee. i with the co-sponsorship of several Republicans. including Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Thad Cochran (R-MS), Foreign Relations Committee member Roger ‘Vick-er (P.-MS), and human rights advocate Sam Brownback (R-KS). if passed, the bill would have authorized the president to provide assistance \to prevent the incidence of child marriage in developing countries through the promotion of educational, health, economic, social, and legal empowerment of girls and women.\ It would have also mandated that the administration develop a multi-year strategy on the issue and that the State Department include the incidence of forced child marriage during its annual evaluation of countries' human rights practices. So what happened? Ros-Lehtinen first argued that the bill was simply unaffordable. In a Dec. i6\ she objected to the Post of the bill, which would be Si.08 million over five years, and criticized it for not providing an accounting of how much the U.S. was already spending on this (Alba The  said the bill would authorize $1o8 million, but would only require $67 million in outlays from fiscal years 2011 to 2015. Ros-Lehtinen introduced her own version of the bill, which she said would only cost $1 million. But in a fact sheet gDF.), organizations supporting the original legislation said that Ros-Lehtinens bill removed the implementation procedures that gave the legislation teeth. \Without such activities, the bill becomes merely a strategy with no actual implementation. And without implementation of a strategy, the bill will have an extraordinarily limited impact,\ they wrote. Regardless, the supporters still thought the bill would pass because House Republican leadership had not come out against it. But about one hour before the vote, every Republican House office received a message on the bill from GOP leadership, known as a Whip Alert, saying that leadership Nyould vote \no\ on the bill and encouraging all Republicans do the same. The last line on the alert particularly shocked the supporters. \There are also concerns that funding will be directed to NGOs that promote and perform abortion and efforts to combat child marriage could be usurped as a way to overturn pro-life laws,\ the alert read. The bill doesnt contain any funding for abortion activities and federal funding for abortion activities is already ; prohibited by whats known as the almenè\ which has been boiler plate language in appropriations bills since 1973. Invoking the abortion issue sent the bill's supporters reeling. They believed that it was little more than a stunt, considering that Republican pro-life senators had carefully reviewed the legislation and concluded it would not have an impact on the abortion issue. Rep. Stephen LaTourrette (R-OH) - the Republican leadership for invoking the abortion issue to defeat the forced child marriage act in a floor speech .Friday morning. \Yesterday I was on the floor and I was a co-sponsor with [on] a piece of legislation with [Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN)] that would have moved money, no new money, would have moved money so that societies that are coercing young girls into marriage... we could make sure that they stay in school so theyre not forced into marriage at the age of 12 and 13,\ LaTourette said. \Ail of a sudden there was a fiscal argument. When that didnt work people had to add an abortion element to it. This is a partisan place. Im a Republican. Im glad we beat their butt in the election, but there comes a time when, enough is enough.\ But it was too late for LaTourette and other Republicans who had fought hard for the bill, including Aaron Schoch, (R-11). The bill is even less likely to pass next year, when the GOP will control the House and Ros-Lehtinen will control the Foreign Affairs committee. The main author of the bill was Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was incensed when the bill failed in the House. -The action on the House floor stopping the Child 'Marriage bill tonight will endanger the lives of millions of women. and girls around the world,\ Durbin said in a Thursday statement. \These.voung girls, enslaved in marriage, will be brutalized and many will die when their young bodies are torn apart while giving birth. Those who voted to continue this barbaric practice brought shame to Capitol Hill.\ For the NGO and womens advocacy community, the implications of this defeat extend much further than just this bill. They also saw Republicans invoke the abortion issue when objecting to the International Violence Against Women Act and expect the new Congress to push for reinstatement of the \Mexico City Policy,\ which would prevent federal funding for any organizations that even discuss abortion. \Any time a health bill that has to do with women and girls comes to the House floor, were going to see a debate like the one we just saw,\ said one advocacy leader who supported the bill. \Its hard to imagine how any development bills are going to pass in this environment.\ The protection of women and girls is a major focus of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who promised to elevate the issue Thursday when rolling out the State Departments Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She has said that forced child marriage is \a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights\, and that \the Department of State categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child abuse\. States Ambassador at Large for Global Womens Issues Melanne Verveer has worked hard on the issue behind the scenes. But at the eleventh hour, when the going got tough, the bills supporters said that the administration was nowhere to be found. In October, the White House decided to waive all penalties under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, another Durbin led bill that the NCO community supports. United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 6o million girls in developing countries now between the ages of 20 and 24 were married before they reached 18. The Population Council, reproductive and child health, estimates that the number will increase by too million over the next decade if current trends continue. ! One of the two biggest problems identified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan Strategy Review released Thursday (?• :) is the Pakistani militasys failure to crack down on some of the terrorist groups using Pakistans tribal areas as a safe - haven from which to launch attacks across the border into Afghanistan. Pakistan • a major offensive, involving approximately go,000 troops, against extremists in South Waziristan in October 2009, and its military has also undertaken efforts to stamp out militants in other border areas. However, the military has yet to launch offensive military operations in North Waziristan, where insurgent groups wreaking havoc in Afghanistan reside. Pakistans envoy in Washington, Ambassador Husain Haggai* reacted to the report by saying that Pakistan will engage isla.mist groups in North Waziristan, including the •Hartgani network (no relation), but only when there is sufficient support in all areas of Pakistans government for the effort, and not until they are confident that the mission can be completed effectively. \Pakistan has made it very clear that we are fighting terrorists because they are a threat to our own existence as a modern democratic nation. We will fight all groups in all parts of our country,\ Haqqani said in an exclusive interview with The Cable. \But we will follow timelines that suit our own capabilities and can lead to success.\ Haqqani said that the Pakistani army, which has taken the fight to six out of the seven regions inside Pakistan in which domestic militant groups operate and suffered thousands of casualties in the process, is simply not in a position to expand its war on the extremists now. \Right now, it's only a question of operational capability and readiness. Our armed forces have been engaged in dealing with flood relief work,\ he said. \We have to see what resources we will allocate in which part of the country, and those rather than any political factors are responsible for any waiting period.\ He also noted that \there is a fragile consensus in Pakistan in favor of military action against regional elements,\ and that Pakistans government has no choice but to make the decision to attack North Waziristan groups on a timeline that prioritized Pakistani considerations over American ones. \Sometimes its easy for our allies to tell us what to do and for us to tell our allies what to do. But everyone makes decisions based on their own perceptions and analysis of on ground realities,\ Haqqani said. In several discussions with other Pakistani officials, an even more complicated picture of the Pakistani position on attacking groups in North Waziristan emerges. The Pakistanis largely believe that the U.S. government is being unrealistic in terms of the timelines it wants for cracking down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghanistan- Pakistan border, which have existed for decades. , \There will always be a gap between our two countries because the Americans want things done quickly and done their way,\ another Pakistani government official said. ; A third senior Pakistani official said that many Pakistanis feel that the ()barna administration is placing too much of the blame on Pakistan for the lank of progress in the 'U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. 'The U.S. keeps telling Pakistan to do more, but Pakistan keeps telling the U.S. to do more on certain questions such as speeding up building up of Afghan army, establishing a real process toward reconciliation, and providing Pakistan the means for large scale operations,\ the official said. The United States has provided Pakistan with several billions of dollars in military and economic aid to support its war against domestic insurgents. But many in the Pakistani government have criticized what they say characterize as the slow arrival of these funds, which they say are in any case too small to address Pakistans severe problems. \Its very simplistic to measure success in amount of assistance provided to Pakistan,\ one Pakistani official said. In remarks delivered during the rollout of the strateu review Thursday, President Obama was diplomatic when discussing his administration's ongoing drive to push Pakistan to do more in North Waziristan. \Increasingly, the Pakistani government recognizes that terrorist networks in its border regions are a threat to all our countries, especially Pakistan. Weve welcomed major Pakistani offensives in the tribal regions. We will continue to help strengthen Pakistanis capacity to root out terrorists,\ said Obama. \Nevertheless, progress has not come fast enough. So we will continue to insist to Pakistani leaders that terrorist safe havens within their borders must be dealt with.\ Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged in an interview the same day that there was more work to be done on the relationship before the Pakistanis were willing to fully support the U.S. and NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. \Given the ups and downs of our historical relationship with Pakistan, they fear our abandonment,\ she said. \Their calculus is very much affected by the long-term commitment they feel from us and in working in a strategic partnership.\ The White House recognizes that its efforts have fallen short so far. \The bottom line is that Pakistan is a country where we have little influence, little access and little credibility,\ one of Obama's aides to■..-:), The New York Times. The administration's official line, therefore, is to agree with the Pakistani government and express sensitivity to its claim that they simply can't expand their war against extremists at this time. \We would like them to move tomorrow, we would like them to take out these people tomorrow,\ the new U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter. \But we understand theyre telling us honestly about the capacity of their military, and when they are able, we are convinced they will move in.\ But for many in Washington, the open-ended delay in Pakistan.s promise to expand military operations into North. Waziristan represents a strategic choice, and is not just a result of the militarys operational limitations. But whatever Pakistans reasons, the delay doesnt inspire confidence that the Obama administration can meet its timelines for making progress in Afghanistan. \Pakistan, meanwhile, iS hedging its bets, supporting proxy actors like the Quetta Shura Taliban and Haos iani Network that might counter Indian interests in Kabul after the United States and its allies eventually withdraw,\ Andrew Extnn of the Center for a New American Security. The insurgent sanctuaries in Pakistan are one of the two Achilles heels in the NATO strategy.\ ‘0 tt \ Posted: 17 Dec iOO C 4:42 AM PST In a rare instance of bipartisanship, the House of Representatives moved to pass a resolution Friday honoring the life and work of the recently departed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. The resolution C, was sponsored by outgoing House Appropriations State and Foreign Ops Subcommittee chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), and cosponsored by incoming House Foreign Affairs chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Howard Berman (D-CA), and Mike Turner (R-OH). The bill is \a concurrent resolution honoring the exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and recognizing the significant contributions he has made to United States national security, humanitarian causes and peaceful resolutions of international conflict.\ \The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke on Monday, December 13th, is a great loss for the American people,\ Lowey said in a statement. \One of our nations most talented diplomats, Richard Holbrooke possessed a fierce determination and unsurpassed brilliance in advocating for American security, diplomatic, and development interests around the world - in Southeast Asia and post-Cold War Europe, at the United Nations, and most recently in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His exceptional accomplishments as a peace-maker, diplomat, writer, scholar, manager and mentor will define his legacy as one of the true great foreign policy giants of our time.\ Ros-Lehtinen praised Holbrooke as \one of the most consequential world diplomats of the last half-century,\ and said that \his tireless work in pursuit of United States national interests and international peace have put us all in his debt.\ After praising his career -- which included two stints as assistant secretary of state, peace negotiator in the Balkans, U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and service as U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Ros- Lehtinen called for reform of the United Nations and protection of Israel within its bodies. \In New York at the UN, [Holbrooke] did much of the heavy lifting on Congressionally-led efforts to rein in UN spending, to make more equitable the dues paid by the United States, and to improve the standing of Israel in that multinational body,\ she said. \Sadly, those concerns have returned with a renewed urgency -- with the need for fundamental reform of UN budget and the virulently anti-Israel UN Human Rights Council -- and the Congress can only hope to have such a tenacious, principled partner in the future.\ You are subscribed to email updates from Email delivery Dowered by Google To stop receiving these emaIls, you may .r...hs■- . ; Inc. 20 West Kinzie, Chicago IL USA 60610

Gordon will attempt to overwhelm news coverage of the loss with a cabinet reshuffle, as early as the next day, June 5. The plot (sounds like the Tudors): David is the target, from multiple angles and motives, personal ambition mixed with anti-Blairism. Peter has always wanted to be Foreign Secretary, a job held by his grandfather, Herbert Morrison. (Morrison was also deputy PM, why doesn't Peter want that?) New Labour people regard Peter as more ambitious than New Labour at this point. He supported Gordon's utterly misbegotten and wildly unpopular proposal to raise the top tax rate to 50 percent. The fallout is less resentment of the affluent to paying more or grudging understanding of need for new revenues as it is a sense that Labour under Gordon is abandoning the project for social aspiration and opportunity that is at the heart of the New Labour message. Ed Balls, one of Gordon's closest longtime advisers, is also determined to topple David. Balls is a contemporary of David's, wants to be leader of the party himself, and continues the Gordon v. Tony bitter rivalry into the future. Balls is currently Minister for Children and Schools and was linked to Damian McBride (Gordon's hatchetman, who has trashed Blairites, got caught out on his blogging scheme to smear Cameron). If Gordon names Peter to David's job, Balls would take Peter's and become Business Secretary. David would be pushed into Home Secretary. Once Balls takes Peter's job, Balls will likely reverse Peter's privatization proposal for the Royal Mail to win support from party's left-wing base, beginning of his campaign against David for post-Gordon leadership struggle. Tony sees the situation as terminal. Hope to speak with him soon. He is trying to become President of Europe if and when Lisbon treaty passes. Jonathan made an interesting and ironic comment about Colin Powell, given Tony's deference to him, that Powell's flaw was being too deferential to Bush. From bitter experience, Jonathan is wishing you well, be close to the president, and advance your ideas, too. There's more for when we can talk. Sid At last, a great mobile device for under $50.

C05768460	George Bush to David Cameron: don't derail Northern Ireland peace process Exclusive: Former president urges Cameron to rein in Unionist partners • Nicholas Watt • quardian.co.uk, Monday 8 March 2010 21.20 GMT • Article history Former US president George Bush has called David Cameron over his concerns for the Northern Ireland peace process. Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA The former US president George Bush has made a direct plea to David Cameron to support the Northern Ireland peace process, amid widespread concern in the US about the Tories' new electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists. In his most active intervention since leaving the White House, Bush took the rare step of calling the Conservative leader to ask him to use his influence to press his unionist partners to endorse the final stages of the 15-year search for a settlement. Bush, who took a close interest in the peace process during his years in the White House, telephoned Cameron last Friday to ask him to plead with the UUP leader, Sir Reg Empey, to endorse the deal in a vote tomorrow in the Northern Ireland assembly. Democrats and Republicans fear that the peace process could be undermined if the Ulster Unionist party, formerly Northern Ireland's largest party, which governed the province until direct rule was imposed in 1972, votes against the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers to Belfast. While the UUP does not have enough votes to scupper the deal, the White House fears a no vote from the UUP could undermine support for the settlement within the Democratic Unionist party and among the wider unionist community. Cameron has faced intense pressure in recent months over his decision to form an electoral pact with the UUP, which could provide him with crucial support if the general election leads to a hung parliament. The pact has prompted fears in Washington that Cameron may abandon the even-handed approach to Northern Ireland adopted by John Major in the early years of the peace process. The Guardian understands that the White House is so concerned that the US economic envoy to Northern Ireland, Declan Kelly, persuaded Bush to intervene. The former president telephoned Cameron to ask him to use his influence to persuade Empey to vote for the deal. \There was a feeling that a conservative to conservative conversation was the right way to go about this,\ said one source familiar with the transatlantic negotiations. \This conversation was borne out of the concern that Empey is holding out.\ Another source familiar with the contact said: \This is the most active thing George W Bush has done in his post- presidency period. He has been incredibly restrained and diplomatic since leaving the White House. He has maintained radio silence.\ One source familiar with thinking on Northern Ireland on both sides of the Atlantic added: \The fact that George W Bush has decided to intervene is really significant. He was interested in the peace process as president and appointed an envoy. It is a general sign of how concerned people are in the US about what David Cameron is up to.\ A Tory source said: \George Bush did have a conversation with David Cameron. It was a positive conversation. David underlined his commitment to the agreement and said we are doing all we can to support it. But he said that we cannot force Sir Reg to vote for it. George Bush thanked David and said, I can see you are engaged.\ The disclosure of Bushs intervention came as Empey met the executive of his party tonight to decide whether to endorse the deal brokered last month at Hillsborough Castle between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists that would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month. B6 The UUP leader, who is minister for employment and learning in the four-party power sharing executive, believes it is foolish to devolve the final set of powers while the coalition is struggling to function. In a sign of Empeys unease about endorsing the deal, a meeting between the UUP and the Sinn Fein deputy first minster, Martin McGuinness, broke up after just three minutes tonight. The White House and political leaders across the spectrum in the US have been watching developments with care. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, today pleaded with Empey in a 15-minute telephone call to support the deal. A group of US Congress members wrote to Cameron last month to issue a stark warning that dissident terrorists will be \emboldened\ to intensify their attacks if he fails to persuade the Tories partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process.

C05769491	Are the Mideast Policy Team! by Leslie H. Gelb July 7, 2010 I 2:38pm I ri==IPresident Barack Obama meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office of the White House, July 6, 2010. (Gary Fabiano / Sipa Press) Obamas bow to Netanyahu was just the latest in a series of disastrous missteps in U.S. policy toward Israel. Leslie H. Gelb on whos to blame—and how the White House can get back on course. Whoever advised President Obama to flay Israel publicly until this week should be fired. Only advisers with no experience in dealing with Israel could have believed that Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Netanyahu would bow to public attacks. And whoever advised Mr. Obama to kneel rhetorically to Mr. Netanyahu in public on Tuesday should also be fired. The only thing accomplished by this embarrassing tactic was to put Israel in a position to call the shots on Mideast policy for the rest of Obamas first term. The real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; its failure. Were the culprits the non-foreign policy White House intimates — chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and political honcho David Axelrod? Axelrod knows nothing about this, and worse, Emanuel thinks he does because he lived in Israel. Was George Mitchell, the presidents Mideast negotiator, the brains behind the foolishness? Surely, hes had enough experience working with Israelis to know better. Did General James Jones, the National Security Adviser, remain silent, again? And of course, where was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton? Strangely for someone so adept at pleasing Israels constituents in America, she spent a lot of time this past year publicly beating up on Israeli leaders. Has she been led astray by the pro- Arab contingent of the State Department? •Martin Indyk: New Hope for Mideast Peace •Peter Beinart: Netanyahus Latest Insult Or is the guilty party none other than President Obama himself? The more we find out about who makes decisions in the White House on every subject from nuclear weapons to coloring of Easter eggs, it turns out to be the man in the Oval Office himself. Hes the expert. Hes the decider. He invites everyone to state his or her piece or peace, then he tells them what to do — and seemingly without question, they do his bidding. Mr. Obama started his White House tenure from a near-zero base of foreign policy knowledge and no experience in the Middle East. It was easy enough to guess this blissful state from his earliest decisions. He came out of the box demanding that Israel agree to suspend construction on the West Bank as a precondition for direct negotiations with the Palestinians. Anyone who knew anything about this situation surely would have told the president that the chances of Mr. Netanyahu agreeing to this \proposal\ were zero, or minus zero. No Israeli leader, even a dovish one, would ever dream of beginning negotiations by conceding his major bargaining card. As the teenagers say, what were Obama and his advisers thinking? And yes, after the Israelis publicly humiliated Vice President Biden during his trip to the Holy Land by announcing they would start new construction in East Jerusalem, Washington had to respond vehemently. The Israelis had been arrogant and stupid on this one. They had weakened American power in the region. No U.S. president could let them get away with it. Clinton and others made strong public statements of criticism, and those were fine. But Mr. Obama then allowed Mr. Netanyahu to come ahead with his planned visit to D.C. — and publicly humiliated him. The U.S. president let the Israeli prime minister cool his heels for hours before meeting with him, then wouldnt shake his hand when he departed. Theres no surer way to unite a nation behind its leader, even a controversial one like Netanyahu, than to have a foreign leader humiliate him. This brilliant tactic — thought of by Obamas advisers or the president himself — accomplished two things. It stiffened Israeli backs even further against being conciliatory about starting talks with the Palestinians. The Israeli government was not about to cave to American pressures. It also galvanized Israeli supporters in the United States — in particular within conservative parts of the Jewish community and the Republican Party. There went Mr. Obamas support for pressing Israel even in private. To top this all off with Tuesdays meeting, full of smiles and the adoption of Israeli-desired language on almost every topic, only made matters worse. It made the situation look as if the American president had been cowed by Jewish control of . . American politics. That certainly pleased American and Israeli hawks, but it did not please others who want to see genuine progress in Mideast talks. There is a time and place for Washington to put pressure on Israel. Mr. Obama and his team picked every wrong time and place. The right occasion to squeeze is when the negotiations have reached the point where both sides have given and where both must give more to close the deal. Only at that point does pressure make sense. All parties would get a real shot at peace in return for their concessions. To be sure, many ask at this point — How do you get to that point? The answer is not to browbeat the parties to scurry to the negotiating table. That tactic simply never pays off. The answer is to build conditions beyond the negotiating table, conditions in the political community in both Israel and Palestine, that would support compromises at the table. The British pushed the Catholics and Protestants to make concessions year after year, only to fail time and again, only to further inflame feelings all around and spur greater violence. Finally, London focused on getting Protestant and Catholic women to form common groups to support compromise. London did as much with various business communities that evolved into backers of mutual concessions as well. Only then did parties know that they had support for compromises, their negotiations got somewhere, and they reached agreement. Thats what needs to be done between Israel and the Palestinians. We hear time and again that the enemy of peace in the Middle East is time, and that time is running out. Perhaps that is what has caused Mr. Obama and his team to misstep so badly; they think its a race against the clock. Do something now or fail. But the real enemy of a negotiated settlement in the Mideast is not time; its failure. Neither Israel nor the Palestinians nor the United States can afford to fail again. After yet another failure, it could well result in perpetual violence. To set his Arab-Israeli policy on a sensible course, Mr. Obama needs to search for new advisors who know how to get things done in the Middle East, hire them, and listen to them. Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and use power in the 21st century.

C05767501	POLITICS d,.dby MARC AMBINDER « The Sunday Shows In Five Bullet Points I Main Nov 29 2009, 9:13 pm by Marc Ambinder A Last-Minute Meeting On Afghanistan President Obama convened a last-minute meeting of his national security team tonight to discuss the language that his administration will use to describe its new strategy for Afghanistan. Two administration sources confirmed that the meeting, which began at 5:oo pm, included cabinet officials like Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The officials would not describe the meeting and said that no other news organizations were being given any background briefing. That suggests that the meeting was akin to a pre-game rally session by the commander-in-chief: he wants to gert everyone from Gates to Gen. Stanley McChrystal to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same page before the presidents Tuesday speech. Before young officers at West Point, Obama will announce his decision about Afghanistan to an increasingly skeptical nation and a Democratic Congress that is threatening to condition its budgeting on identifiable off-ramps and timeframes. Obama is expected to announce that hell order several Army combat brigades to Afghanistan -- about 30,00o troops in all, most of them to be tasked with more rapidly standing up Afghanistans indigenous army. His speech, as described in broad terms by advisers last week, will be short and serious. His challenge is to persuade Americans that the war in Afghanistan is winnable, as Americans tend to give their presidents significant leeway so long as they believe that the president is confident in his strategy. Officials said last week that while would outline a clear exit strategy, he would not tie troop withdrawals to any specific political developments in Afghanistan, which might run into opposition from Democrats in Congress, who are demanding benchmarks. Nor is the President likely to impose direct conditions on Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai. An official said that Obama plans to try explain the interconnection between the the stability of Pakistan and the nexus of terror in Afghanistan. An explanation that the American people would accept has proven elusive. Permalink :: Comments (0) TrackBacks (0) :: Share

Security Reform (PNSR), If you did not like what happened in the last 7 or 8 years... youre not going to like whats coming in the future.\ \Momentum for reform is building, but it is largely rhetoric and good intentions,\ reads PNSRs .new report . The congressionally funded group was begun as the result of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \Strategic management of the national security system remains absent and is desperately needed to make it integrated, cohesive, and agile,\ the report continues. Calling reform of the national security infrastructure \the number one national security issue,\ Locher said that Americas ability to operate in international arenas the world over is \crippled\ by the dysfunction within the system. He called the White Houses national security staff \incredibly weak,\ preventing integration and coordination that the National Security Council should be doing. \There's almost no strategic guidance from the president or the executive office of the president,\ Locher said, adding, \We have almost no knowledge management in the national security system.\ Theres also no effective means for delegating the presidents authority, he added. Locher spoke a an event rolling out the latest PNSR report at the New American Foundation; hosted by its foreign policy chief and editor of V/gst1inc.Vgz? N.DtL:9 Steve Clemons. Clemons noted that according to the Goldwater-Nichols act, President Obama was required to submit a national security strategy by June 18, 150 days into his presidency, but he failed to do so. The \Guiding Coalition\ that oversaw the PNSR report included heavyweights such as former Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine, former Amb. Robert Blackwill, retired Gen. Wesley Clark, retired Adm. Ed Giambastiani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, plus Washington players Brent Scowcroft, Thomas Pickering, and Joseph Nye. Last Novembers version of the PNSR report included input from now Obama officials Jim Jones, James Steinberg, Michele Flournoy, and Dennis Blair. It declared that \the national security of the United States of America is fundamentally at risk.\

C05762498	Longtime Clinton confidant Blumenthal to become Clinton advisor Tue, 06/23/2009 - 1:00pm Longtime journalist and former Clinton White House advisor Sidney Blumenthal will become a special advisor without portfolio to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, The Cable has learned. Blumenthal refused to comment. But sources say he is filling out the paperwork and disentangling himself from other obligations as he moves to become a special advisor to the secretary whose presidential campaign he helped advise. The position would not require Senate confirmation. Clinton, who is recovering from surgery to repair a broken elbow, has been building her team at the State Department, while establishing her credentials as a team player supporting and amplifying her former presidential rivals foreign-policy vision. Sources close to her says she will prove indispensable to Obama, a point several Obama aides also made to Politicos Ben Smith in a piece noting the relatively background role she has played in these early months. The planned addition of Blumenthal, a longtime confidant of the Clinton family and a fierce defender of Bill Clintons presidential legacy, could indicate she plans to raise her profile. (Blumenthal is probably Clintons best speechwriter, a friend notes.) In the foreign-policy arena, Blumenthal advised former President Clinton on U.S.-British relations, and first introduced him to future British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has also been active in the Third Way- Progressive Governance process. A former Washington Post reporter, Blumenthal has contributed commentary and editorial advice to Vanity Fair, Tina Browns new online magazine The Daily Beast, the New Yorker, and Salon. Blumenthal has also been a fellow at New York Universitys Center on Law and Security. Laura Rozen I Permalink I fA9ç%1 Comments? Login or register 52

Sid http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jun/12/david-miliband-gordon-brown-labour-leadership/print The Guardian David Miliband: Labour is facing the fight of its life Foreign secretary thought about quitting the government in last weeks turmoil David Miliband expressed his frustration at a lack of vision from the Labour leadership. Photograph: Martin Godwin Voters still dont know what Labour and Gordon Brown stand for, David Miliband admits today, as he reveals how close he came to quitting the government during last weeks turmoil at Westminster. Speaking to the Guardian at the end of 10 extraordinary days, the foreign secretary says the partys high command was given an \electric shock\ by the disastrous European election results, and he urges fellow ministers to get out and prepare for \the fight of our life\. But Miliband also concedes that he considered following his close friend and ally James Purnell, who resigned from the government last week and called for the prime minister to stand down. Miliband said: \Id made my decision on Thursday. Sometimes you can make your decisions with great planning and calculation and sometimes you have to make them rather more quickly. James made his decision in good faith, I made my decision in good faith ... we all have tolive with our decisions.\ The Labour party has a settled view of who should be leader, he said. \This divides people who are close and people feel passionately one way and people feel passionately the other way.\ Describing the task now facing Labour, he says: \It could not be more urgent that there is a maximum of 11 months until the next general election, that we got 15% of the vote nationally [last week], that we came second in Wales and that one in 20 people voted for us. If that does not electric shock us out of our ministerial chairs to think: By God, we have got the fight of our life on our hands because whatever the Tories are they certainly dont deserve a landslide — then nothing will.\ Miliband has not given a domestic policy interview for nearly nine months since he felt dogged by accusations that he was manoeuvring for the premiership. He refuses to acknowledge that his decision to back Brown last week saved the prime minister, saying \it is impossible to tell\. But the foreign secretary feels his loyalty has given him the freedom to speak his mind without his motives being questioned by anyone in Downing Street. Miliband betrays frustration at the absence of a clear Labour vision, saying: \We need the message to go out that we have got the humility to learn about what has gone wrong. \It is not a masochism strategy. It is about saying what we believe in. It is about clarity, priority, adding up to purpose. I know what we stand for, I know what our instincts are, but the voters dont. Actually, I know what Gordon Brown stands for. \We have a responsibility to make sure that, come the election, [voters] know what Labour stands for. We were not being listened to, people felt that they had been forgotten, we neither inspired nor reassured.\ He calls for cabinet colleagues to show stronger leadership in the battle to restore Labours fortunes. \We need to make sure the talents and energies of not just the whole of the cabinet, but the whole of the labour movement are give n free rein because one in 20 people voted for us. The truth is that we are not automatons. We all have to get out there.\ Asked whether he felt voters had stopped listening to Brown, Miliband said: \He himself has said he has to build on his strengths and work on his weaknesses. That is a good maxim for all of us. He is someone who made the right decisions on the biggest issue of the day. We have got a chance to fight with honour and dignity for what we believe in. The stakes are very high because we know that parties can slump into very dangerous positions.\ Providing what he describes as a route map from the disaster, he said: \Labour first needs a period of competent, effective, stable government; secondly, we need to reset our political compass so ministers are no longer locked in their departments, but link their policies to their values; and thirdly, the government has to be at the cutting edge of policy.\ On the issue of political reform, he demands a speeding-up of the pace of political reform, saying it is not a piece of middle-class frippery. For the first time, he reveals that he now backs the Alternative Vote for the Commons, saying MPs legitimacy will be strengthened by being able to say 50% in my constituency voted for me. He says the change cannot be made before the general election. He also backs a fresh push on Lords reform, saying \we have got an agreed blueprint\. He rounded on Tory spending plans, but said Labour would clarify its own intentions before the election. \They will be credible and clear. We will come to that in an open and honest way.\ But he defends delay in setting out these figures, arguing \when you are in the middle of a Tornado it is a bad time take a forecast\. In an oblique reference to the Damian McBride briefings, he also calls on the media to abandon unattributable briefings, saying all politicians spokesmen should be named, or not quoted by media outlets. \The gotcha culture of politics is not in anyones interests,\ he said.

C05771990	Let me try this again. Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong correlation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand strategy of off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version, or at least an academic's version of the elevator version. What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller military due to budget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to apply this proposal to Afghanistan. \An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve Americas core national security objectives through a combination of over-the-horizon (\off-shore\) military power and in-region (\on-shore\) economic and political power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the deployment of large ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic challenges continue and chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly deployable ground forces in combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure Americas interests in combating terrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.\ AM

C05770483	And pasted below is the exchange between Corker and Holbrooke: CORKER: Mr. Chairman, thank you. I want to thank the ambassador for coming. I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country for many years. A number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way. But the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter -- was to provide Congress and the American people with a definition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the civilian mission, and a detailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progress towards achieving those objectives. I have to say, I've been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while I respect the ambassador, I've heard a lot of process. I've heard a lot about meetings. I have no earthly idea -- no earthly idea what our objectives are on the civilian front. And I don't know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time, from the standpoint of -- of hearing, though. And I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we'll have maybe Secretary Clinton and Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed to come. But could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place? HOLBROOKE: I'm sorry. You don't feel that I've told you what our civilian programs are? CORKER: You've told me a lot of process. I'd like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations, the very question we asked when we set this hearing up, is in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the -- for the -- detailed plan for achieving those. I'd like to hear you talk about that. I mean, I'm glad we have a lot of interagency folks here, but I'm not hearing anything that talks about where we're going. I'd also like to know how the withdrawal date that's been set affects that and how it affects those we're working with in the country. HOLBROOKE: First of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the constraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the record and which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs. The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedented effort. Now, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural products until 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of this war. We have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely in a joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs, encouraging alternatives to opium production. HOLBROOKE: Secondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice system which can cut into the Taliban's propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system. Third, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing by eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban. Fourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level. Fifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. Senator Kerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the international presence. The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus' counter- insurgency effort. He and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. We have worked intimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish in private briefings on behalf of me and my team. Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end state and exit strategy. If we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, the consequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction that would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan's west, Iran, as well as the larger region that includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism from that region, just as much as we are. So, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued American economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the military. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for the military campaign. When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won't be on a single day. It will be a gradual process. And that is what the review in December and the president's decision-making will focus on. CORKER: In our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've had some rough times over the last several years -- it's been something that we've been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you're dealing with, that we're dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough. I still don't -- I haven't understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That's not to be critical of them. I just don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It's just incredibly vague to me. And I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don't know what we're doing. They don't know when we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've just had colleagues who have come from there. We've had a -- we've got a president there that's having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because he doesn't know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know what our intentions are, I don't think. And they're making accommodations on both sides. So, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we are in Afghanistan, because we're in Afghanistan, and that we don't have the will to be successful. And we don't have the will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined. But I just don't hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that's what we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship. But I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don't understand. OK? And I have average intelligence, so I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let's have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific. But I don't understand, and I'm very concerned. And I think we're sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there's a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, even within the administration itself, and that has to end. And I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven't done that today. And I would ask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envision Afghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand. We've changed it. Now it's sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it's not out of control. I mean, the bar continues to change. And I'm just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same page as much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined. HOLBROOKE: Senator, I'm sorry that my answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understand your comments and I respect them. First of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I'm asked by everybody -- why are we in Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that while our enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have to strengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can move forward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida. Now, if you do not believe that it's a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I think the Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is. Secondly, on the civilian mission, again, it's in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And we have benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here is always the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States. And we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face out there is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred, and I don't think anything could have proved it more vividly. And to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy's structure -- a different part, but an integral part -- that we face. Now, the Afghan government doesn't yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. How could they after 30 years of war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I've just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law, subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment and a whole series of other major issues -- are part of our civilian programs. And we're happy to come back up to your office -- we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue. Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it's designed to help Afghan institutions establish conditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues, and we're happy to discuss them in detail at any time.

C05761654	Barack Obama may support insurance mandate By CARRIE BUDOFF BROWN I 6/3/09 3:42 PM EDT Updated: 6/3/09 11:22 PM EDT As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama scoffed at Hillary Rodham Clinton's proposal to require people to buy health insurance. \(If) they cant afford it, they just dont get it,\ Obama said during the primary, arguing that a mandate would not work unless insurance costs were lowered first. For the first time, Obama confirmed Wednesday that he plans to stake out a different position as president. In a letter to two leading Democratic senators, Obama said he could support a mandate on individuals to buy coverage, as long as Congress exempted those who could not afford it. This marks a shift from his stance during the campaign, when he tussled repeatedly with Clinton on the issue. She proposed an individual mandate, and he did not. \I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyones costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility,\ Obama wrote. \But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable.\ \If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it,\ Obama wrote. Detailing his positions on various health care proposals for the first time as president, Obama also said Americans should be able to choose between public and private insurance plans in a reformed health care system. \I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance option operating alongside private plans,\ he wrote. \This will give them a better range of choices, make the health care market more competitive, and keep insurance companies honest.\ He offered qualified support for a mandate on employers to provide insurance or pay a fee to the government. Employers \have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees,\ Obama wrote, but small businesses should be exempt. Obamas positions on these issues were not entirely surprising, but his decision to weigh in before congressional Democratic leaders released a single bill was unexpected. Prior to the letter, Obama and his aides had declined to say specifically where he stood on various issues, including the public plan and individual mandate, saying they wanted Congress to lead the way in writing a bill. But Democrats have been anxious for the president to take a more public stance, and the letter provides the guidance that many in Congress had been craving as House and Senate committees move closer to releasing draft bills. \The president says get it done. Get it done right because we only get one chance,\ said Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \The letter essentially synthesizes what the president is saying.\ He outlined the parameters in a letter to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). Obamas endorsement of a public insurance option could boost the controversial proposal and serve as catalyst for the Democratic base as the president kicks off a grassroots campaign Saturday. \Its clear that the Republican resistance to a public plan hasnt softened President Obamas support for one,\ Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \This strengthens the hand of those of us advocating for a public option, which is the only way to keep the private insurers feet to the fire.\ Despite almost uniform opposition from Republicans on the public plan, the president wrote in the letter that he remains \hopeful that many Republicans\ would back an overhaul bill. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, struck an optimistic tone in a statement, saying the letter \doesnt draw lines in the sand,\ and \is helpful because of his statements that reform legislation needs to have bipartisan support.\ However, the letter is likely to incite opponents, who have been frustrated by Obama's lack of specifics. Indeed, on Thursday morning, Conservatives for Patients' Rights will begin airing a new TV ad called \Bulldozer,\ which says a \government-run plan\ will drive private insurers out of business and eliminate consumer choices.

C05770178	I just wanted to make sure you know that the CARE speech is now going to focus on nutrition/health/early childhood, rather than being a major health speech. I still feel that you need to do a health speech as a bookend to food and water — perhaps before UNGA. You could focus on health in the context of the larger Millennium Dev Goals. You have not given a speech yet about maternal and child health. We have a great story to tell with our investment in GHI, and there will be an opportunity to tell it with the ramp-up to UNGA (with the Summit focusing on MDGs). There is a tremendous amount of activity going on elsewhere in the world. And this is a legacy issue for you. (I have already relayed this idea to CDM and Jake).

For your situational awareness: SWO Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the USA Pavilion at the Shanghai Expo around 12:30 p.m. for 15-20 minutes Thursday, April 29 (Shanghai time). USA Pavilion Commissioner General Jose Villarreal and Consul General Beatrice Camp greeted President Hu, who was accompanied by Vice Premier Wang Qishan, Shanghai Expo Bureau officials, and a large contingent of Chinese media. Hu then walked through the pavilions initial section (the \Overture\) where Vice Premier Wang Qishan called attention to all the logos of the pavilions sponsors. The Chinese president also viewed a film clip of President Obama welcoming visitors to the pavilion and shook hands with about 10 of the nearly 80 U.S. \student ambassadors\ staffing the pavilion. Before departing, President Hu thanked Commissioner General Villarreal and wished the USA Pavilion great success.

C05769542	sbwhoeop Sunday, July 11, 2010 10:06 AM H: fyi, leaked Luntz poll on Bibi policies; and many congrats to Huma! Sid Below is a transcript from Israeli TV News Channel Ten on a leaked poll taken last week by Frank Luntz. Heres a summary: 1. 56% of Americans agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza; 2. 43% of Americans agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving; 3. 34% of Americans support the Israeli operation against the Flotilla; 4. 20% of Americans \felt support\ for Israel following announcement of easing of Gaza closure. Frank Luntz analyses Netanyahus media performance in the flotilla affair The figures are troubling and worrisome. If that is the situation with our great friend the US, it is easy to imagine the situation in other, somewhat less sympathetic countries. Channel Ten TV News, July 1 2010 20:38 Yaacov Eilon (host): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered to make an extremely persuasive presentation in the world press. But a professional analysis by a US expert presented yesterday to his senior aides strongly criticizes him. Netanyahus messages on the flotilla caused more harm than good. Our political correspondent Chico Menashe has obtained the report. Chico Menashe: Criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahus current PR messages and Israeli PR in general comes from the international elite of media consultants and pollsters and from the mouth of Frank Luntz, considered one of the leading American political consultants, a Republican pollster, a consultant to many governments throughout the world and to dozens of the biggest corporations in the US. He was asked by the Jewish organization The Israel Project to check the opinions of the American public on the messages Israel issued to the world during and after the flotilla events. The result is a harsh document that primarily criticizes the media strategy of the person considered Israels number one propagandist in the world, Prime Minister Netanyahu. Netanyahu: Once again Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment. Chico Menashe: Every time Israeli speakers begin with accusing the international community, writes Luntz, they lose their audience. For example, Netanyahus comments after the flotilla about the world hypocrisy were rejected by most of the American participants who listened to them. The findings were presented last night to senior members of Netanyahus Bureau. Luntz checked the opinions with focus groups, not a poll. He warns of a dangerous slide in the public opinion of the only country considered pro-Israeli, the U.S. Israel misses simple opportunities to change world public opinion, he writes, and the consequences are significant. The American public increasingly hesitates to accept arguments that support Israeli positions. Ehud Barak: There is no hunger in Gaza and no humanitarian crisis. Netanyahu: Theres no shortage of food, theres no shortage of medicine, theres no shortage of other goods. Chico Menashe: Luntz says Israel must immediately stop using the argument that there is no hunger and no humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says this fatally destroys Israels credibility in light of the images on the television screens. Israel must admit that there is a problem, he says, to gain the listeners sympathy [emphasis mine]. Luntz finds the troubling figure that 56% of participants agree with the claim that there is a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and no less astonishing is that 43% of participants from the American public agree with the claim that people in Gaza are starving. But even lifting the closure that was supposed to improve Israels image missed the opportunity, according to Luntz. Netanyahu: Yesterday an important decision was made by the security cabinet. Its meaning is clear. On the one hand, allowing civilian goods into Gaza, and on the other hand maintaining the military blockade of Hamas. Chico Menashe: The statement by Netanyahus bureau of lifting the closure missed the opportunity to gain support in international public opinion [emphasis mine]. Only 20% of the Americans polled felt support of Israel following the statement. According to Lunt, this is the summary of the flotilla damage in American public opinion: Only 34% of the American public support the Israeli operation against the flotilla, and he says that is a dangerously low percentage.

C05770304	Madam Secretary, As requested, below is a brief bio (compiled by DK, INR, and AF) of Kenyan Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Richard Momoima Onyonka, who you met in Krakow at the Community of Democracies. Please let me know if you would like any further information or follow up on this. Thanks, Mike Richard Momoima Onyonka is a Kenyan politician and belongs to the Peoples Democratic Party. Born in 1962 and hailing from the Bogeka clan, VM Momoima has lived in Otamba, Nyamataro, Mosocho and Nairobi. In 1982, following the failed Kenyan coup detat attempt to overthrow President Daniel Arap Mois government, VM Momoima was among the 900 people that were jailed. However, in 1984, he returned to the University of Nairobi and graduated with a Bachelors degree in commerce a year later. After graduation, VM Momoima attended North Carolina State University where he graduated with a Masters degree in management. He returned to Kenya in 1992 during the first multi party elections to help his father (then incumbent MP for Kitutu Chache and Minister for Planning and National Development) who was seeking re-election on a KANU (Kenya African National Union) ticket. VM Momoimas first political opportunity arose when his father passed away in 1996, which prompted an election in which he lost to a new corner during the party (KANU) nominations. Since the Kenyan parliamentary election in 2007, VM Momoima has represented the Kitutu Chache Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya. A financial economist by profession, VM Momoima currently runs personal businesses in Nairobi and Kisii and has held positions in the Kisii KANU branch. His priorities include economic empowerment, particularly for youth and women, education, and poverty reduction. Michael H. Fuchs U.S. Department of State (202) 647-1709 B6

C05766357	H: Of interest, Hague latest briefing, hostile to Tony. Tories desperately do not want Blair there, want to run their own European policy, mostly anti-EU, and indeed break with past and continuity on Europe. Tory Party split, with anti-EU faction dominant, its base virulent, and Cameron straddling as best he can. Hague leans anti-Europe. S London Times October 22, 2009 `Appointing Blair as EU president will have consequences, warns Hague William Hagues strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the EU ambassadors baffled Francis Elliott, David Charter and Tom Baldwin William Hague has been conducting a behind-the-scenes campaign to convince European ambassadors that Tony Blair would be a bad choice for European Union president, The Times has learnt. The Shadow Foreign Secretary used a lunch organised by the Swedish presidency in London last week to lobby the most senior diplomats of the 26 other EU nations against the appointment. EU leaders had hoped to choose the new president at next weeks summit, but the Czech Republics last-minute objections to the Lisbon treaty have scuppered that. President Sarkozy of France wants a quick decision, however, and is understood to be pushing for a special one-day summit in Brussels next month to fill the new post. In making the Conservatives case against Mr Blair, Mr Hague said that while in Downing Street the former Prime Minister had consistently placed a higher priority on US interests than on those of Europe. Mr Hague also reminded the diplomats of Mr Blairs actions in the run-up to the Iraq war, according to one of those attending the lunch last Thursday. A claim that Mr Hague told the ambassadors that the Tories would regard Mr Blairs appointment as a \declaration of war\ by the EU was denied, however. A spokesman for Mr Hague said that the phrase was \a bit strong\. Nevertheless, it was not disputed that Mr Hague made clear that the move would have consequences for relations between Britain and Brussels. Diplomats said that there was a \clear mark of hostility\. \Mr Hague wanted to leave the ambassadors in no doubt that the Conservative Party is opposed to the appointment of Tony Blair as president of the European Council and [that] it would only underline the lack of accountability and legitimacy involved in the creation of the position in the first place,\ Mr Hagues spokesman said. Mr Hagues strident attack on his fellow Briton reportedly left some of the ambassadors baffled. Mr Hague is currently in Washington for talks with members of the Obama Administration, including Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State, with whom he raised the issue of the Conservatives membership of a right-wing alliance of European parties with allegedly anti-Semitic members. He accused critics of running a smear campaign against some of the group, led by Michal Kaminsky, head of Polands Law and Justice Party.

C05764139	Hillary: Peter Galbraith just called me and I had a long talk with him. As you know, as chief of US mission to UN in Afghanistan he has protested the election fraud and come into conflict with the head of UN there, who wanted to cover it up. Peter has just come out of Afghanistan after four solid months there. He is pessimistic, says the analogy to Vietnam is not wrong-headed, that comparisons of increasing troop levels there as though the surge in Iraq could be replicated are misguided, but thinks there is an approach that should be attempted that involves the vote recount and trying to replace Karzai. He wishes to speak with you directly. He says that he has difficulty communicating with Holbrooke, not because he cant reach him, but because he finds Dick disjointed these days. Peter is on a plane right now to Norway, then London, then to NY on Wed, then could go to DC. He says you can reach him through the US mission to the UN office. FYI, from Wash Post today: \The issue of how seriously to take the fraud charges, and whether to force a runoff, has also caused a rare public rift within the international community here. The senior American official at the U.N. mission, Peter W. Galbraith, left the country abruptly Sunday in a dispute with the mission director, Norwegian Kai Eide. \Galbraith had pushed for an exhaustive probe. Sources who are familiar with the dispute but are not authorized to. speak on the record said Eide argued that the international community should not press too hard because it could undermine national stability. Galbraith had been convinced that Karzai could not win without fraud and had tried to reduce the number of polling stations in some areas in the south, the incumbents ethnic stronghold, said one diplomatic source. Eide and others, the source said, were convinced that Karzai would win in any case and that any irregularities could be smoothed over, as they were in the 2004 presidential election that Karzai won by a safe margin.\ And, I've included below Jane Smiley's rave review of Max's book. Sid http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-smiley/republican-gomorrah_b290293.html Your request is being processed... Jane Smiley Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novelist and Essayist Posted: September 17, 2009 02:56 PM HuffPost Book Review: Republican Gomorrah About twenty years ago, I read an article about a death row inmate who had shot a clerk in a convenience store. The way the murder was presented by the man on death row was mysterious--his hand just rose up and the gun went off. Shooting the clerk in the face in the midst of a robbery wasn't in fact his fault. He never said, \I shot a man.\ It just happened. I thought of that man while reading Max Blumenthal's terrific, but also, of course, appalling new book, Republican Gomorrah. Apparently there isn't a single person in the present incarnation of the Republican party who does anything. Things happen--God does it. Satan does it. No Republican is an agent of his or her own success or failure, sin or redemption. It just happens. The consequences of this lack of responsibility are there for all to see--screaming threats, guns at rallies, unhinged behavior every time a Republican doesn't feel the way he or she wants to feel, absolute sense of powerlessness leading directly to an absolute will to power. Because that was the thing that struck me about the murderer in the 7-11--he had the power and in his own last moments, the clerk knew it. But the killer, no matter how well armed, never felt it. Republican Gomorrah is a frightening book because it is clear to all of us on the outside that the various Republican operatives who surround James Dobson and his ilk have no consciences and will stop at nothing. They invoke the name of God for purposes that shame God absolutely--hurting, destroying, maiming, and damning others who either don't accept their beliefs or don't acknowledge their power and righteousness. Of course that is frightening. But Blumenthal's cast of characters, beginning with Dobson and his prodigal son, Ryan, and including John Hagee, Sarah Palin, Ralph Reed, Charles Colson, Judith Reisman, Christina Regnery, Donald Wildmon, et al. strike the reader as above all else very small--egocentric, narrow minded, uneducated, selfish, and resentful. Each of these qualities is destructive in and of itself The combination is turning out to be coercive. Even those of us who are immune to the emotions these people play upon are getting more and more nervous about the power that they wish to exert. Blumenthal does two things that no one else I have read manages to do--the first of these is that he organizes the network. He shows how Ted Bundy is connected to James Dobson is connected to Gary Bauer is connected to Erik Prince is connected to Ralph Reed is connected to Jack Abramoff is connected to Tom Delay is connected to Tony Perkins is connected to David Duke is connected to Mel Gibson, and so forth, and in the course of tracing these connections, he informs us, or reminds us, of the crimes and misdemeanors these people have committed. Two of my favorites are James Dobson's son Ryan's messy divorce (Dad seems to have paid the settlement--did he not dare to discipline? Or did he discipline too much?) and David Vitter's habitual recourse to a brothel in New Orleans where Republicans \wanted to be spanked and tortured and wear stockings--Republicans have impeccable taste in silk stockings\ (the madam is talking about men). Republican Gomorrah is full of crimes-- both those we've already heard of, such as Abramoffs and Ted Haggard's, and those we haven't (there is good evidence that Texas billionaire T. Cullen Davis, funder of the right wing Council For National Policy, ordered hits on his estranged wife, and succeeded in murdering his step-daughter and the wife's boyfriend). This aspect of the book reminds me of a Scottish novel called The Private Memoirs And Confessions Of A Justified Sinner by James Hogg, in which, once a man believes he is among the saved, he can commit any sin he wants to and be sure he will go to heaven. Once Davis was \saved,\ for example, he said, \My goal is to get to heaven. Ill do anything it takes to get there, and Im not going to let anything stand in my way.\ He must have thought getting to heaven was just another power play. And power plays are the key to right wing psychology. Right wing psychology is the other thing that Blumenthal has to offer. At the periphery of this world is your run-of-the-mill bully, a man like Jack Abramoff, whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates, but who sang like a bird once he was caught. At the center of is James Dobson, a much more destructive figure than Abramoff, who advocates, in the strongest terms, child beating, and not only child-beating, but dog-beating. At one point he brags about going after the family canine (who weighed twelve pounds) and engaging in \the most vicious fight ever staged between man and beast.\ As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until \he wants(s) to crumple on the breast of his parent.\ In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who, over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing. It order to understand the deeply disturbing effect Dobson and his theories have had on our culture, Blumenthal cites Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom, about the psychology of Nazism and authoritarianism, and Eric Hoffer's The True Believer. Insofar as he finds the documentation, Blumenthal points out how many of these powerful Evangelical Christians were beaten and abused as children (including Dobson). It's a high number. The beatings, often arbitrary, cruel, and frequent, were then, in many cases, backed up with constant lessons about God--that he is arbitrary, that he is cruel, that he demands obedience above all things, and that he surpasseth understanding. The point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child, his shame and guilt as a worthless sinner, and his absolute fear of thinking for himself He will then take his place in the hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy. Blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology, but, in my view, not far enough. I'm sure he was reared by liberal parents, who gave him a sense of responsibility, curiosity, and autonomy, and since he is only in his thirties, I don't think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been interviewing and watching for the last few years. I don't think he understands their fear--how deep it is, how constant it is, and how arousing it is. I don't think, in fact, that Max Blumenthal looks within and sees evil. I think he looks within, and says, \Im okay; youre okay.\ That's the goal of liberal parenting, and as we can tell by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy, divorce, and occurrence of STDs, liberal parenting works-- atheists and agnostics, for example, have a much lower rate of divorce than Evangelicals, and states that have sex education in the schools, rather than abstinence-only education, have lower rates of teen pregnancy. But a child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above all--that the world makes no sense (and so why try to make sense of it?) and that the world is so dangerous that to be oneself, or even to try to figure out what oneself might be, is a death-defying exercise. There is safety only in two things--conforming to a group and, as a part of that group, dominating and even destroying other groups. The rules of the group can be anything at all, as long as the members of the group abide by them. And other groups have to abide by them, too, or the painful and arbitrary rules that group abides by are meaningless. The beaten child's sense of terror can only be assuaged by evanescent feelings of power, because in relation to his parents and to God, he is defined as powerless. When he \crumples\ on the \loving\ breast of his parent (and in my view a person who administers a beating to a living being who is 1/16th his size doesn't know what love is) he accepts his powerlessness and he also accepts that power is what defines this life. That's where your freedom and mine come in. Many of the Evangelicals Blumenthal discusses are Christian Dominionists--that is, they differ from the Taliban only in their choice of doctrine. Their uses of that doctrine (to dehumanize women and other groups, to never share power, to control every aspect of every life within their power, and to create society as a steeply hierarchical structure with them at the top) are those of the Taliban. It's an eye-opener to read about R.J. Rushdoony, son of Armenian immigrants who fled the Armenian genocide of 1915. You would think that a man whose family escaped mass murder would go on to espouse peace, love, and understanding, but Rushdoony went the other way, taking literally the 613 laws in the Book of Leviticus. In his book, The Institutes of Biblical Law, he advocates capital punishment for \disobedient children, unchaste women, apostates, blasphemers, practitioners of witchcraft, adulterers,\ and homosexuals. Gary North, the Presbyterian Christian Reconstructionist, is his son-in-law, and, while not backing down on the mass death penalty, advocates stoning rather than burning at the stake, because stoning is cheaper (and of course that is a factor, because there would be a lot of people to exterminate). As for who would be doing the killing (of you and me, if they could catch us), well, Christians would, but not because they wanted to. Ever unable to accept responsibility, they assign agency to God, who wants us killed, who will beat us until we \crumple\ on his \loving\ breast, a God who has given us all sorts of talents, skills, and interests, but is, like these Christian Dominionists, interested only in power. I believe his motto is \Adore me or I will hurt you.\ Can you believe in a God so small? When I was a parent of young children, I, too, got frustrated, and I, too, thought a spanking might be a good thing. I soon realized that my motives for administering physical punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child- between man and beast.\ As for children, the goal is to keep beating the child until \he wants(s) to crumple on the breast of his parent.\ In other words, Dobson is a proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny, and who, over the years, has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of child-rearing.

I soon realized that my motives for administering physical punishment were highly suspect--more anger and frustration than care for the child or knowledge about effective methods. I then saw a show about child-rearing, in which a woman who firmly believed in child- beating aroused far more resistance in her beaten daughter, and had much more family disruption, than the parents who ignored the tantrum and then used the technique of redirection to train their toddlers. Works with horses, dogs, and other animals, too. It was then I decided that if I, in my human weakness, could put two and two together concerning free will and proper behavior, surely God could, also. I didnt want to believe in a God who was a smaller being than myself. And I dont. The ray of hope in Blumenthals book is that the right-wingers he talks about tend to be so psychologically unstable that they dont have much staying power--think Ted Haggard. But they have numbers. The bad thing about that is that they could take control. The defeat of Sarah Palin, Conrad Burns (R-MT), George Allen (R- VA), Rick Santorum (R-PA), James Talent (R-MO), and Mike DeWine (R-OH) brought us \back from the brink\ according to the website Theocracy Watch. But only back from the brink. The good thing is that they would not be able to maintain what we call a government for very long (see George W. Bush). The bad thing is that they would destroy the country as we know it while they were trying. If I take the long view, well, I think, Stalinism lasted about 25 years, Nazism 12. The Iranian Mullahs have been at it for 30 years. Russia and Germany survived, Iran might, as well. But generations were lost in all these places. And Stalin and Hitler didnt have nuclear weapons. I think about the 22-year-old clerk in that convenience store, looking down the barrel of that pistol. He probably had no idea that his killer had no sense of agency, hardly even knew what he was doing, was seeing his hand as separate from himself. But I have to feel sorry for the killer, too, subject to feelings that he could not label that were terrifying and overpowering. I bet he was beaten, shamed, and neglected as a child. I bet, afterward, he wished someone, somehow, had stopped him.

C05761373	Internet can help free US reporters in NKorea: Clinton US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday urged women students to use the Internet to campaign for the release of two American women journalists held in North Korea. Clinton urged graduates of Barnard College, a women's university in New York City, to show their opposition to Pyongyang's detention of the two journalists who are due to go on trial on June 4. \We have two young women journalists right now imprisoned in North Korea and you can get busy on the Internet and let the North Koreans know that we find that absolutely unacceptable,\ Clinton told the graduation ceremony. Clinton was highlighting the new media tools that women can use to fight injustice around the world. North Korea announced last Thursday that it had set a June 4 trial date for the two journalists — Euna Lee, a Korean- American, and Laura Ling, a Chinese-American — but gave no details of the charges against them. Clinton said afterward that the announcement of a trial date is \a signal that there can be\ a resolution of the case soon, even though she said the pair should be released immediately and the charges against them are \baseless.\ The North has previously said they would go on trial for \hostile acts\ and illegally entering the country. Their trial would be held \on the basis of the confirmed crimes committed by them,\ it has announced. While working on a story about refugees fleeing the hardline communist North, the pair were detained March 17 along the narrow Tumen River which marks the border with China.

Hillary Clinton Embraces New Media By MATTHEW LEE AP Sat, Mar 21, 2009 WASHINGTON (AP) — Her videos aren't quite viral yet and she's not tweeting, but Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is embracing new media, using the Web to promote the agency and her role as the nation's top envoy. In less than three months, Clinton's State Department has embarked on a digital diplomacy drive aimed at spreading the word about American foreign policy and restoring Washington's image. Part of a broader Internet outreach by President Barack Obama's administration, Clinton's Web efforts already have outpaced those of her predecessors. Since taking over at Foggy Bottom, Clinton's team has built on e-diplomacy innovations developed during George W. Bush's presidency: - They have revamped the department's Web site (http://www.state.gov) and the Dipnote blog (http://blogs.state.gov and http://twitter.com/dipnote) with a fresh array of features, graphics and colorful posts. - Users can track her foreign travel on an interactive map (http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvI/map/?trip_id5) - They can keep up virtually with her every move through Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo). - They can pose questions through an \ask-the-secretary\ column (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/117297.htm) that recently was revised to \text the secretary.\ (http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/ask/secretary/120236.htm) \New media is critical in this new era of diplomacy, where smart power and expanded dialogues are essential to achieving our foreign policy goals,\ said Cheryl Mills, Clinton's longtime confidante and chief of staff. Even for a government Web site, early indications show a surge in interest, according to internal State Department statistics provided to The Associated Press. Daily views of the Dipnote have doubled from 10,000 a year ago to 20,000 today, with 700 subscribers to its RSS feed, twice as many as in March 2008. The number of followers of the department on Twitter has tripled since Jan. 20, when Obama took office, while the department's Facebook friends have increased by 2 1/2 times in the same period. 8 \What they are bringing in is more willingness to experiment,\ said Peter Daou, who was Clinton's Web guru during her 2008 presidential run. \They are starting to push the envelope.\ What remains unclear, though, is whether the spike in interest reflects the revamped Web site or the public's fascination with Clinton's latest career shift. \The personality behind it cant be dismissed,\ said Daou, who now blogs on human rights and other issues for U.N. Dispatch (http://www.undispatch.com). Like Obama, Clinton carries a Blackberry, but she is not allowed to use it on the departments secure seventh floor where her office is. Aides say she takes an active role in answering questions from the Web, responding to bloggers and pushing her agencys new media agenda. \The United States Government is behind nearly everybody, except in certain discrete areas, in terms of technology,\ she told department employees at a town hall meeting in February. \We are, in my view, wasting time, wasting money, wasting opportunities, because we are not prepared to communicate effectively with what is out there in the business world and the private world.\ Clinton was quick to embrace new media at the start of her presidential campaign. She announced her entry into the race in February 2007 on the Web and followed with regular Internet chats and Internet fundraising appeals. Nonetheless, Clinton was surpassed by the Obama campaigns mastery of the Internet and social networking sites. Obama used the Web to raise record donations and identify and orchestrate an army of volunteers. Clinton was first lady when the first White House Web site debuted in 1994. It was a bare-bones operation compared with what is available now. Three years later, the State Department went online during Secretary of State Madeleine Albrights tenure. But it wasnt until 2007, under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rices spokesman, Sean McCormack, that the departments public affairs shop began exploring new media in earnest. McCormack started the Dipnote blog, which some foreign service veterans predicted would fail, given the private and stuffy nature of diplomacy. The site endured under Rice. Clinton has retooled Dipnote with a Twitter feed and a broader range of posts from diplomats. Its more than just window dressing. This past week, diplomats used Twitter to \tweet\ down false rumors they feared might lead to a siege on the U.S. Embassy in Madagascar. On her first two foreign trips, to Asia and then the Middle East and Europe, local bloggers were \embedded\ with the traveling press corps, broadening the audience for Clintons official meetings and public appearances, which often produce more personal than policy questions. On her question site, Clinton has responded to a varied questions, from \Should the U.S. engage in direct dialogue with Hamas?\ to \How did you like meeting the Japanese students?\ By the end of Clintons trip to the Mideast, her \text the secretary\ feature had received nearly 2,000 text messages. On both trips, Clinton also participated in Webcasts. One in Beijing on climate change generated more than 10.2 million page views, more than 50,000 comments and 7,000 questions, according to the statistics. Clintons staff say they plan to venture further into the realm of social networking, an animated online world called Second Life, and cell phone technology. The department hopes to follow through on a Bush administration organized 9 project that brought together Facebook, Google, Howcast, YouTube, AT&T, MTV, Columbia Law School, Access360Media and Gen-Next for an Alliance of Youth Movements summit. It also wants to expand on X-Life, a mobile phone game launched in February that is aimed at helping youth in the Middle East learn English and teaching them about American history, culture and values.

C05769792	FYI: Brazilian FM defends dialogue with Iran BRASILIA, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Tuesday Brazil would maintain negotiations with Iran on uranium enrichment and oppose any sanctions against Iran. Amorim said Brazil was against the production of nuclear weapons, but Iran had the right to carry out a peaceful nuclear program. \Dialogue is still possible. What we want is to make sure (that the uranium will not be used to make weapons) through peaceful ways and dialogue,\ Amorim told reporters. Under a draft deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, most of Irans existing low-grade enriched uranium should be shipped to Russia and France, where it would be processed into fuel rods with a purity of 20 percent. Iran declared on Tuesday it had started the process of producing 20-percent enriched uranium inside the country. In response to Irans announcement, the U.S.-led Western countries have warned to take political and economic sanctions against Iran. For his part, Amorim said he considered any kind of sanctions ineffective and dangerous because they might cross a limit and jeopardize peace. Irans president made an official visit to Brazil in November, during which the Brazilian government defended Irans right to have its own peaceful nuclear program including uranium enrichment similar to Brazils, following international standards.

C05765255	WASHINGTON (CNN) — Fewer than three in 10 Americans think Sarah Palins qualified to be president, according to a new national poll - the least of any of the five potential candidates included in the survey. But another woman tops that list in the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday: two-thirds of the public thinks that Secretary of State Hillary Clintons qualified for the Oval Office. Thats more than Vice President Joe Biden, whos currently next in line for the presidency. According to the poll, 28 percent of Americans say Palin is qualified to run the White House, with seven in 10 saying the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee is not qualified. The survey indicates that a majority of Republicans, 54 percent, feel Palin is qualified, with 44 percent indicating she isnt. But only 29 percent of independent voters questioned feel she is qualified to serve as president, with 68 percent disagreeing. According to the poll, nine in 10 Democrats feel Palin is not qualified. The polls release comes one day before the release of Palins book, \Going Rogue: An American Life.\ \The perception that Palin is not qualified to be president puts her significantly behind two potential rivals for the GOP nomination in 2012 - Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee,\ says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. According to the survey, nearly half of all Americans think Romney is qualified to be president, with 43 percent feeling the same way about Huckabee. Among Republicans, Palin is still lagging other potential 2012 primary candidates: 63 percent of GOPers think that Romney and Huckabee are qualified, 9 points higher than the number that say the same of Palin.\ Palin has many strengths - recent CNN polls indicate that Americans believe that she is not a typical politician, that she cares about average Americans, and that she is honest and trustworthy,\ says Holland. \But the perception that she is not qualified for the White House is her biggest Achilles heel.\An ABC News/Washington Post poll also released Monday indicates that 38 percent of Americans say Palins qualified to serve as president, with six in 10 saying shes not qualified. The CNN survey indicates that 67 percent of people questioned say that Clinton is qualified to serve in the Oval Office, 17 points higher than the 50 percent of Americans who think that Bidens qualified to take over as president.Bidens low number may be attributable to negative feelings about the Obama/Biden administration rather than views of Biden personally.\ In the past, poll respondents who dislike an administration have sometimes taken it out on the vice president,\ say Holland. Polls from the late 1990s showed that Americans felt Al Gore was qualified to be president, but only if respondents were given the chance to say something negative about Gore that was unrelated to his qualifications, he adds. In the Bush administration, the number who thought Dick Cheney was qualified to be president dropped as the administration grew more unpopular. \Cheneys experience in office didnt change during that period - attitudes toward the Bush/Cheney administration did,\ he says. Hillary Clinton also has the advantage of having been able to stay out of domestic policy debates, including health care, the economic stimulus, and other controversial matters, while adding almost daily to her experience in foreign policy, Holland adds, while Biden has been involved in the domestic policy disputes - \which might explain why some respondents were looking for a reason to say something negative about the veep.\ The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The surveys sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall sample.

C05769895	From John Beyerle ... Perhaps the Russians wont send troops: I just called Karasin. He agreed that the situation had gotten worse in Osh and Jalalabad today but said the Russian position is still that sending in foreign troops, whether Russian or CSTO, will be counterproductive and lead to more violence and bloodshed. The IL-76s that flew in to Kant today were the EMERCOM/M4C planes he told me about yesterday; they have humanitarian cargo, primarily doctors and medical equipment. I cited the news reports that a battalion of paratroopers had gone in -- he said there may be some troops on board to guard the plane or beef up security at Kant, but he was firm that at this point Russia has no plans to introduce its own forces in the south. The main objective was to stop the violence through peaceful means; Russia had provided the Kyrgyz forces with additional \technical means\ for accomplishing that. He said they hoped this would help Kyrgyz forces get control of the situation, which was their main goal. I asked about CSTO planning, and possible UN or OSCE PKFs. He said there is no formal CSTO meeting planned, although people are consulting via phone. He repeated their hesitation to see any CSTO deployments. They have not yet considered UN or OSCE PKFs, but if the situation continues to deteriorate, he wouldnt exclude the possibility. Rushailo is currently in Moscow, but may be sent to Bishkek tomorrow or Tuesday. He agreed to call me if there is any major change in the situation on the ground, or regarding force deployments. Tomorrow is a Russian holiday but hell have his cell phone on.

Sid Financial Times FT.corn A poisoned process holds little hope By David Gardner Published: August 25 2010 22:46 1 Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46 „ As the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time, the pervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming — and with good reason. The Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground — in particular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land — pull in the opposite direction to peace. \We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick,\ is how one Arab minister puts it, \and here we go again.\ While many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides, the heart of the question remains the continuing Israeli occupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Arab and — a 50 per cent rise — took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres at.the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat, who wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the occupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war. A decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering of cantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and criss-crossed by segregated Israeli roads linking the settlements. Last month, BTselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has now taken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege of Gaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison. The main feature of the present situationi is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peace process and these — in Israeli parlance — \facts on the ground\. At last months White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangement into a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader \willing to take risks for peace\. But there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in response to Mr Obamas Cairo speech denying any legitimacy to Israels settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words \Palestinian state\ — but he surrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning. Indeed, the words all sides use — peace, resolution, security, and so on — may be the same; but what each side means by them is different. The mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salem Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartet made up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living in peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to preserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean? He has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions on Jerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung \ideological\ ones and the 100-plus \outposts\ established as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a sort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government. Will he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easily close difficult deals? There is little to suggest that: The thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irredentist. While his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodox parties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be fair, Israels electoral system — with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable — means lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice of partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US. As risks he. has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires next month and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling, moreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and around Jerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line with Mr Netanyahus strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israels eastern border. As diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised in the occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped Palestinian Authority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed to marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out. The outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22 Arab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the occupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.

To better explain, here is where it starts, the LGF work 3 days then transition (swing shift) into . nights then transition into 3 days off (it used to be 2x2x2). Each work day equals 14 actin I I!(-) of work; Supervisors can average up to 15 hours per work day. Snap shot of an average day for a shift: 1. 05:00hrs every day, Shift Brief for on-going shift, along with \In-Service Training\. .I Convoy Brief, followed by convoy load time and organization for entire shift (approx i during the day) followed by actual convoy movement. 2. 05:45 to 06:15hrs. (approximately) you have the shift change over on site, 3. 06:15 to 17:45, regular work day on site. 4. 17:45 to 18:15, Shift change over, followed by reorganization of convoy for off-going. slii then actual convoy movement 5. 18:30 (approximately) Off-going shift returns to Camp Sullivan, weapons and equipment are down loaded and convoy equipment is stowed, vehicles re-staged in parking lot. 6. 19:00 (approximately) Off-going shift is complete, all equipment is accounted for and secured, they are then on personnel time whether to work out and train, eat dinner, watch movie, internet, phone calls, sleep or etc. 7. 10 hours later, it starts all over with a 05:00hrs Shift Brief not taking into considers tit wake-up and grooming and breakfast. This averages an actual 14 hour day for each LGF member. Some days can be as short a, hours and some days as long as 14.5 hours. Supervisors can average an additional (approximate) 30 minutes prior to and after a shift conducting administrative duties and or ,;1 organization. All personal hygiene, laundry, personal e-mail/matters, Physical fitness, usually meals and sleep must be conducted within the 10 hour window between an individuals shifts. After completing the 3 days in a work cycle which ends at 19:00hrs, the shifts swings into night shift schedule. Their next duty starts at 17:00hrs the following day for the evening briefmg. This is a 22 hour transition window which most LGF only sleep once and are again with the same 14 hour schedule for their first night shift. This can be viewed as gea i one good sleep in for a 36 hours window of time (by the end of their first night shift, fol two more night shifts). When finishing their last night shift, they are immediately off, however, do to working ah (arriving back at Camp Sullivan around 06:30) they sleep most of the first day off. They the have to adjust back into a night-time sleeping pattern. The second day off is a designated training day. Third day is a scheduled off day. If you average this work schedule out over the course of a month, an LGF member transitio, from a day to night sleeping pattern on average of 7 times. Its nearly impossible to establish rhythmic sleeping pattern. This is what causes the sleep deprivation. You can see its efftiek over the course of time. When a shift gets back on ground after an R&R, they are fresh and rt, of energy, as compared to a shift that is been in the grind for 7 or 8 weeks and sometint,:.. after 5 and 6 weeks. In summary, a disruption or addition to the current work schedule further compounds t1. sleep deprivation and is not sustainable by the LGF for extended periods of time.

She sends her greetings and underscored again what you mean to them. SEWA is on the cutting edge of so many exciting developments. We had a great conversation on many things, including how much women in the developing world can and must do to address climate change and drive low tech green industries. In the villages, I could feel the pollution in my eyes and throat -- so much needs to be done at the local level. Much pollution is produced because of the way women cook, etc. When I get back, will work up some ideas on this. Delhis been enshrouded in smog for the last couple days. The SEWA project I visited 2 hours outside of Delhi was so impressive. Women who were among the poorst of the poor had become businesswomen capable of traveling to London and Brussels to negotiate contracts with companies for their embroidery etc Were going to have SEWA play a key role in the Vital Voices summit that you announced that will take place here next year. Maria Otero was still here when - arrived so she joined me for the SEWA mtgs. I also went to one of Rushira Guptas antitrafficking projects. You know her as weve been working with her thru WH years. She got the global citizens award at CGI this year. I dont think Ive seen worse conditions than what shes trying to address. In Mumbai we launched an anti- trafficking campaign with Bollywood which brought in new players to the cause. Tomw, I will be speaking on this years World Economic Forum Gender Gap report for India. Theres so much potential for Indias economic growth -- as the WEF points out --- if theyd tap womens potential here. India is last of the BRIC countries on most indicators and comes out poorly generally. Will be raising some of these issues with govt in Dialogue mtgs. Anyway, I thought of you so much everywhere I went. Im so happy to be part of your legacy on these issues. Travel well.
C05769102	• aClose Window • Print this lop_ag_ From The Sunday Times March 28, 2010 Its over: MPs say the special relationship with S is dead Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt and Josef Stalin Michael Smith BRITAINS special relationship with the US forged by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in the second world war -- no longer exists, says a committee of influential MPs. Instead, Americas relationship with Britain is no more special than with its other main allies, according to a report by the Commons foreign affairs committee published today. The report also warns that the perception of the UK after the Iraq war as Americas \subservient poodle\ has been highly damaging to Britains reputation and interests around the world. The MPs conclude that British prime ministers have to learn to be less deferential to US presidents and be \willing to say no\ to America. The report, entitled Global Security: UK-US Relations, says Britains relationship with America is \extremely close and valuable\ in a number of areas, particularly intelligence co-operation. However, it adds that the use of the phrase special relationship, in its historical sense, \is potentially misleading and we recommend that its use should be avoided\. It does not reflect the \ever-evolving\ relationship between the two countries and raises unrealistic expectations, the MPs say. \Over the longer term, the UK is unlikely to be able to influence the US to the extent it has in the past,\ the committee adds. In an apparent rebuke to Tony Blair and his relationship with President George W Bush, the report says there are \many lessons\ to be learnt from Britains political approach towards the US over Iraq. \The perception that the British government was a subservient poodle to the US administration is widespread both among the British public and overseas,\ the MPs say. \This perception, whatever its relation to reality, is deeply damaging to the reputation and interests of the UK.\ While the relationship between the American president and the British prime minister was an important part of dealings between the two countries, the cabinet and parliament also had a role to play. \The UK needs to be less deferential and more willing to say no to the US on those issues where the two countries interests and values diverge,\ the MPs say. They are also critical of the US use of extraordinary rendition and torture. The report calls for a comprehensive review of the use by the CIA of British bases, such as that on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, to carry out extraordinary rendition. \The issues relating to rendition through Diego Garcia to which we have previously drawn attention raise disturbing questions about the uses to which US bases on British territory are put\, the MPs say. They express regret at \considerable restraints\ on the ability of both the government and parliament to scrutinise US activities carried out on British territory. \We recommend that the government should establish a comprehensive review of the current arrangements governing US military use of facilities within the UK and in British overseas territories.\ The review should \identify shortcomings in the current system of scrutiny and oversight ... and report to parliament on proposals to remedy these\. The report also demands a statement from the government on the implications of the Court of Appeal judgment regarding the alleged collusion of MI5 in the torture of Binyam Mohamed, a British resident. Last month the court ordered the government to release evidence from American intelligence reports which showed that MI5 was aware of the torture. Senior US officials subsequently suggested that releasing such evidence might prevent the US from sharing some intelligence with Britain.

C05767157	I'm sorry I was not able to join last week's meeting on Haiti but I have calls into Anne Marie and Arturo to get an update. Once I get a better understanding of how we plan to move forward on a regional basis we will work on putting together a comprehensive PD strategy to support our efforts If you like the idea I can begin to trial balloon it with media execs in US and LA that I know personally to gauge their reaction. Of course we can't rely on a psa campaign alone to sustain the effort so we will develop other PD strategies for engagement throughout the region which I will forward as they evolve. Let me know what you think. In the meantime I thought you might be interested in the report below (copy attached as well) which outlines the results to date of our global media outreach initiative. Successfully Engaging Global Media About the U.S. Role and International Cooperation in Haiti Examples of Post Efforts to Date EUROPE • Reinforcing the Secretary's message, U.S. Ambassador to France Rivkin engaged directly with over 100 journalists in an event streamed live on-line by CNN, where he highlighted U.S. assistance to Haiti and the cooperation of the US with France, the UN and the international community. Embassy Paris also reached out to senior officials in the Elysee, MFA, French media and civil society at all levels to underscore the message of positive coordination with our French partners and to set the record straight on the work of the USG in Haiti. As a result, leading French officials dismissed rumors of rising diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Leading officials consistently praised the work of the Obama administration in Haiti and the need for a strong US role in the emergency response. • Embassy London's media blitz featured Ambassador Susman, who underlined the U.S. commitment to Haiti at an Embassy Martin Luther King Jr. holiday event with actor James Earl Jones; the event was covered by BBC World News (audience 270 million worldwide) and various U.K. papers. The Ambassador and the JO also spoke about Haiti on January 20- 22 on BBC TV 2's \Daily Politics Show,\ BBC Radio, the BBC TV Evening News, and other media and helped embed an ITV journalist on the USNS Comfort to help balance ITV's previously negative reporting and reached out personally to BBC producers to call attention to inaccurate reporting alleging that the U.S. military prevented Medicins Sans Frontiers from delivering aid and supplies to the airport in Port Au Prince. • With media coverage growing more critical, U.S. Ambassador to Greece Speckhard gave an interview to Ta Nea newspaper and DCM Deborah McCarthy, who previously served in Haiti, was interviewed by Real Sunday newspaper, resulting in positive stories about U.S. assistance to Haiti. Meanwhile, the PAO spoke with the Director of Elefterotypia, whose paper has run some of the most misdirected coverage of Haiti, and received a commitment to run an Embassy-produced story to counteract the misinformation. AFRICA • Four African posts — Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania — organized highly successful outreach programs based on the diversion of the USS Gunston Hall to Haiti. The ship, with African officers aboard, was headed to western Africa under AFRICOM' s African Partnership Station maritime security training program when it was diverted to provide relief to Haiti. With African officers working alongside U.S. military officers to deliver assistance to Haitians, PAOs at those posts connected local reporters with the ship to conduct live interviews of the Africans for their home media, resulting in excellent media placement in all four countries. • On January 20 U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Gips gave a 10-minute live interview on Haiti with 5FM, a leading youth station with listenership of approx 800,000. The Ambassador highlighted the depth and breadth of US support and congratulated South Africa for sending emergency teams. The radio hosts told the Embassy afterward that e-mails and SMS messages were pouring into the station in support of U.S. efforts. Ambassador Gips reached out to additional audiences via broadcast media on January 21 and recorded a program via the Africa Regional Media Hub with SABC-International TV's \Rendezvous Africa\ program (broadcast across the continent) and live interviews with drive-time radio programs on two national stations. • As a result of a press conference hosted by the Embassy on January 22, all major Angolan media gave positive coverage to U.S. efforts in Haiti, including Radio Nacional de Angola and the Jornal de Angola newspaper, which ran an editorial January 23 that stated: \We need to believe and let those on the ground do their work because the old tactics of criticizing who is doing something for the Haitian People just for the sake of criticizing at a moment like this is not acceptable. . . Just see the numbers of daily flights that arrive in Haiti to have an idea and quickly come to the conclusion that the possible failures and omissions do not supersede the positive and timely work done by the entities undertaking the relief efforts in Haiti.\ EAST ASIA-PACIFIC • The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia's January 21 byliner on Haiti ran as the lead item on the editorial page of Sep utar Indonesia daily, and it was subsequently picked up by Antara, the Indonesian national news agency, and subsequently appeared in most Indonesian media. • South Korea: Looking to help Korean audiences connect with the situation in Haiti, PA Seoul arranged a Digital Video Conference with the U.S. Consul in Nagoya, Japan, who had previously served as Information Officer in Port-au-Prince and was a fluent Korean speaker. CG Kwak underlined the long tradition of US humanitarian assistance to Haiti as well as the massive US response to the current crisis and noted Korea's own active involvement in the relief work. The U.S. Ambassador's blog on January 22, dedicated to the earthquake and those affected by it, received more than 1,500 hits in three days, with almost all comments supporting U.S. concerns. The EAP Regional Media Hub in Tokyo hosted a journalists' roundtable with Gordon Duguid in Haiti on January 25 that included journalists from Hong Kong's Ming Pao newspaper, Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper, BERNAM.A (Malaysian National News Agency), and Australia's Canberra Times newspaper and Radio 6PR (Perth), and resulted in favorable stories appearing over the next few days in all participating media. NEAR EAST • Lebanon: Television station Al-Jadid is not Hezbollah-affiliated, with most of its funding coming from the Gulf and Libya. Their coverage is also routinely sensationalistic and mirrored Al-Manar's coverage. PAS Beirut clarified aspects of USG assistance in Haiti to Al-Jadid on January 20. On Saturday January 23, Al-Jadid hosted the PAO for 30 minutes on morning news talk-show al-Hadath to discuss American relief efforts in Haiti. The PAO was able to address many of the accusations carried in the Al-Manar report, including the myriad \weapons testing\ myths being propagated by Russian and Venezuelan media outlets. [Post cannot engage directly with Hezbollah television station Al-Manar as it was designated as a Special Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2006 under E.O. 13224] • Morocco: On 1/28/10 the nationalist French-language daily L 'Opinion published an op-ed entitled, \Haiti: After terror, the dread...\ The paper is generally considered to be fairly hostile to the USG, however, on 1/29/10, PAO Rabat and an FSN went to L 'Opinion to discuss the op-ed. Post was amazed to find the staff, including the writer himself, accommodating and even apologetic during the meeting. The editor-in-chief immediately agreed that the piece had been unfair, and the writer somewhat sheepishly explained himself by saying that public opinion had not quite recovered from \the Bush years,\ but readily acknowledged as well that the article was not balanced. PAO gave the writer a dossier of Washington File articles and some information from Infocentral's regular updates, which he promised to use in writing a counterpoint article. On 2/1/10, L 'Opinion published an article entitled, \The massive humanitarian action of the United States,\ based on the articles provided by Post. The excellent article underscored the scope of American assistance, both government and private sector, to aide Haiti's earthquake victims. • Syria: Syrian state-run media coverage of the USG role in Haiti relief efforts has been largely negative and inaccurate, portraying the U.S. military as occupying Haiti. Examples include the Ba'ath party's Al-Baath newspaper publishing three critical articles (1/21/01) under the headlines: \US Crimes in Haiti,\ \US Military Forces Tighten Grip on Haiti,\ and \US Forces Stop Humanitarian Planes from Landing.\ On 1/25/10, government-owned Tishreen published an op-ed claiming that the superpowers were rushing towards a military conquest of Haiti in order to profit from reconstruction operations, which is the new method of colonialism. On 1/28/10, DAS Maura Connelly met with Syrian Ambassador Mustafa, who promised to work to halt the negative coverage coming from some Syrian outlets. To encourage more balanced coverage, Embassy Damascus will host a roundtable 2/3/10 with - journalists from government-owned and independent Syrian media. Post also extended a personal invitation to an advisor of the Minister of Information.

C05772036	Verma, Richard R <VermaRR@state.gov> Friday, November 5, 2010 6:05 AM H; Lew, Jacob J; Mills, Cheryl D FW: The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee The Cable: Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee Granger seeking chairmanship of State and foreign ops subcommittee Posted: 03 NOV 2010 1131 AM PDT Texas Congresswoman Kay Granger will seek the chairmanship of the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, according to her spokesman, ending rumors that she would forgo the post in favor of some other position. Although no decisions have been made, until last night Granger was the ranking Republican on the panel and she is the clear frontrunner for the job. She would succeed current chairwoman Nita Lowey(D-NY), who has served as chairwoman since 2006. \Congresswoman Granger is interested in continuing on as chair of the state and foreign operations appropriations subcommittee,\ Matt LeffingwelL her press secretary, toldThe Cable Wednesday. When power switches in Congress, a complicated game of musical chairs begins as senior members jockey for committee and subcommittee chairs. Just being the highest-ranking minority member on a panel doesn't mean one automatically takes over the chairmanship. But if Granger does succeed Lowey, she will play a large role in writing the bills that appropriate money for State Department operations, USAID, foreign operations, foreign assistance, humanitarian assistance, and many other things. Those accounts all face unprecedented pressure next year as the GOP led Congress will be looking for spending cuts that don't have strong domestic constituencies. Last month, we identified Granger as one of 10 Republicans who stand to be influential in the next Congress if the GOP won control of the House. Since then, we've received several e-mails from sources who had heard that Granger would forgo the subcommittee chairmanship to pursue leadership of another panel. We've heard that Ander Crenshaw (R-FL), the third-ranking Republican on the panel, was eyeing the chairmanship with the expectation that Granger would step aside. (Mark Kirk (R-IL), the second-ranking Republican on the subcommittee, was elected Tuesday night to become the junior senator from Illinois, the seat once held by Barack Obama.) So how would subcommittee chairwoman Granger handle the responsibility of writing the State and foreign ops appropriations bill? Here's what we reported in October: Although [Granger] supported the bill put forth this year by current chairwoman Nita Lowey CD-N.Y.), she criticizedthe increases for the foreign-ops budget, saying, \We also face the continued concern in our own country about our economy and the devastating effects of skyrocketing deficits and debt.\ She's a strong supporter of a balanced budget amendment, which doesn't bode well for foreign-aid funding in this dismal fiscal environment. Granger also serves on the defense subcommittee, placing her at the intersection of the debate over how to balance the national security budget and shift resources from defense to diplomacy and development. Here she seems to favor the Pentagon, saying in June, \I want to be sure that we arent increasing foreign aid at the expense of our troops.\ Her lack of support of international organizations was criticized by the group Citizens for Global Solutions, which gave her an \F\ in its 2007to 2009 rating. Granger is also on board with efforts to eliminate aid to countries that are not performing on internal reform, as she explained when expressing opposition to funding of the Senegalese government through the State Departments Millennium Challenge Corporation. \We can't just give out money and say we will put up with whatever you are doing,\ she said. The committee leadership assignments wont be doled out for at least two to three weeks, our Hill sources report. But if Grangers bid is successful, shell be instantly influential. The fiscal 2011 State and Foreign Ops bill still has not been completed by Congress, despite that the fiscal year began Oct. 1. The stop gap funding measure that has been funding these programs since then, known as a \continuing resolution,\ expires in December. The lame duck Democratic led Congress is unlikely to be able to pass full appropriations bills on its way out the door, so they will likely pass another short term continuing resolution. That would leave the final work on the actual bill to the incoming class led by the GOP next year.

C05772555	sbwhoeo1 Friday, 0c 3 10 4:08 PM H: The Boehner poll. Sid raw Westen Psychologist and neuroscientist; Emory University Professor Posted: October 8, 2010 09:23 AM dJnLM L t , -. -1.117.=1MIC2VAILISIrie ll=a===.1 According to news reports, today Republican minority leader and Coppertone model John Boehner will give his \closing argument\ to the American people on why they should throw out the Democrats and kill the Obama-Pelosi-Reid \job- killing agenda.\ He will be returning to his working class roots, speaking at a piping manufacturing plant, an unusual venue these days for a man who is seen much more frequently at gatherings of Wall Street executives with open checkbooks and the males-only country club where he works on his tan when not making the rounds at other clubs with industry lobbyists. Either the Speaker-to-be is following the model of Michael Steele and free-lancing, or Karl Rove and the Republicans believe it is safe or even advantageous to bring him out in public after the White House made an effort to put Boehners face on what a Republican majority might look like, with the president invoking his name eight times in one speech. I have to admit that at the time I was agnostic as to whether it made sense to try to brand him at this late date, as Boehner has minimal name recognition among voters. But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities. First, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most Republicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP -- which means for once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than playing catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican were the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove, who is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington again). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when telling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could alternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehners tanned visage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special interest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro Man, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the floor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republicans bogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi. I remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action Network and I conducted a national 5urye:y with 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting and likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could speak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for the GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were surprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters, although as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a \likely voter\ in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good messaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not just to reflect them.) As detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is a target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for Congressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than Congressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length narratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those narratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and others combined in defining the \Obama-Pelosi-Reid\ agenda. What we found, in brief: is that we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the \job-killing\ socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad actor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and we could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of \whats the matter with Boehner\ with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough conservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil. The narratives that most moved likely voters -- including swing voters, who preferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric -- made clear whose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street executives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would Speak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic voters. In some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line statements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for (although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely reflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter with voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., \We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans\ -- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics) -- to the harder-edged (e.g., \The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know where John Boehners heart is, and it isnt with the middle class,\ or \John Boehner understands deficits. Hes spent nearly 20 years in Washington creating them.\) If theres a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and long-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in November, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that commitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give it to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand for and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special interests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle. In the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging mistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their opponents while their opponents were busy branding them -- and in particular the failure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of faded Republican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested political proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White House and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is split down the middle as to who caused the recession. Reality doesnt brand itself. Hopefully it wont take a debacle in November and another 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief political moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.

C05775479	Pinstripes to cargo pants -- Clinton tailors new vision for diplomacy By Elise Labatt, CNN October 27, 2010 12:51 p.m. EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS • It is the first-ever undertaking for the State Department • Approach will focus on American leadership through civilian power • Going forward, diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit. Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine U.S. diplomacy and development ahead of a top-down review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks. In an essay in the November/December issue of Foreign Affairs, Clinton previews the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, commonly referred to as the QDDR. The review, the first-ever such an undertaking for the State Department, is meant to balance a similar quadrennial review by the Defense Department that projects their strategy and priorities. The new approach to development, Clinton says, will focus on American leadership through civilian power. Both Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and have talked about \demilitarizing\ foreign policy, and Clinton says the QDDR will suggest how to do that, with a whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development, much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis. In the article, Clinton painted the broad strokes of the document, which she called a blueprint for reforms to be implemented over the next four years. Those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across U.S. government agencies, creating a stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that development undertaken by the U.S. has a lasting and \sustainable\ impact. \Economic growth is the surest route out of poverty, and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the United States' national security strategy,\ Clinton wrote in Foreign Affairs. She said that the U.S. ultimate goal in development was to \put itself out of business\ by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future. President Barack Obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in September at the United Nations General Assembly when he released the \U.S. Global Development Policy,\ which changes U.S. efforts to focus on building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential. But the QDDR will outline how to put that policy into practice. Officials say the 150-page document will detail everything from how the United States conducts multilateral diplomacy, how the United States undertakes \stabilization\ efforts in post-conflict areas, how the State Department works with USAID and contractors to the types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach. American diplomats going forward, Clinton said, are as likely to wear cargo pants as a pinstriped suit.

C05777705	Good public movement on START by Judd Gregg. G.O.P. Support for Arms Treaty By PETER BAKER Another Republican senator signaled Tuesday that he may vote for the new arms control treaty with Russia if it comes up for a vote before the Senate adjourns for the year later this month. Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who did not run for re-election, said he hopes that the Senate will get a chance to vote on the treaty, known as New Start, right after a deal on tax cuts and a spending resolution to keep the government operating. \Start is an important issue. It should be fully debated. I am leaning towards supporting it,\ he told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. \I haven't made a final decision,\ he added, noting that Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the lead Republican negotiator on the treaty, still has concerns. \He has some reservations, but I believe many of those reservations are being addressed,\ Mr. Gregg said. President Obama has made passing the treaty his top foreign policy priority for the lame-duck session. Under the Constitution, approving a treaty requires a two-thirds super-majority, or 67 votes, meaning that Mr. Obama needs nine Republicans assuming all 58 Democrats stick with him. At this point, more than that many Republicans have offered positive-sounding statements like that made on Tuesday
C05777937	http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/dec/23/bitter-new-washington/ The New York Review of Books In the Bitter New Washington December 23, 2010 • ;izaibeth O w Of course Obama should have gotten out of Washington more and listened to people, not just talked at them; and, as Walter Mondale said recently, he should have gotten rid of \those idiot boards\—the TelePrompters on which the great orator has been strangely dependent and which divide him from his audiences. Last year, a friend of mine was invited to a Hanukkah party that the Obamas gave for prominent Jews (a group with whom there had been tensions), and after the Obamas descended the grand stairway, they stood in the foyer briefly; the President made a few remarks and shook a few hands, and back up the stairs they went. No mingling. In their first two years, the Obamas have seemed a bit tone-deaf: there were too many vacations while people were hurting, especially Michelles extravagant trip to Spain. (Im as interested in Michelles clothes as the next woman but at the same time think she and her staff are too focused on her looking smashing, which she does. Her wardrobe seems quite extensive for these troubled times.) Barack Obamas personality has been much mulled over in the past two years, but it seems inescapable that his high self- esteem often slides over the thin line to arrogance, which trickles down (with some exceptions) to much of his staff, some of whom are downright rude to all but a chosen few. °barna has seemed uninterested in anyone but his immediate group, and three of the four members of his immediate circle--Jarrett, Robert Gibbs, David Axelrod—had had no experience in governing. The fourth, Rahm Emanuel, expressed himself with such flippancy, arrogance, and overuse of the F-word that he offended not just members of Congress but also would-be allies of the President. Vice President Joe Bider), who is liked on Capitol Hill, was virtually shut out of the dealings with people in Congress in the first two years—\I can handle them,\ Obama told Biden—but Biden is now expected to be given a larger role as part of the White Houses new determination to \reach out.\ (A few months ago highly placed members of the staff also swore they would \reach out,\ but that seemed to last for just a few days.) One of the oddest aspects of Obamas persona is that someone who seems so confident has insisted thus far in having people around him with whom he is said to be \comfortable.\ For example, Torn Donilon, his recently appointed national security adviser (a promotion from his role as deputy), is by all accounts a capable man but is no ones idea of a serious strategic thinker. The explanation I was given for Donilons being given his new position was that \the President is comfortable with him.\ Just as Obama is described as pleased with himself, he has been treated with hero worship by much of his staff. After all, he had taken on the formidable Clintons, and, against the expectation of almost all the pundits and the experts, he had beaten them. Why should he listen to those who had doubted him? A common complaint about the Obama White House in the first two years has been that there were no \grown-ups\ around, people who knew more about governing and who would tell Obama that he was wrong. When people tried to suggest someone who should be brought in, that person was rejected as \not one of ours.\ Joe Biden is said to argue with Obama on issues, such as Afghanistan, but not to get into the management of the White House.... Those who supported Obama in 2008 expected him to be able to move public opinion, to get people to follow him. The fact that the Obama White House has been so poor at \messaging\ baffles even his strongest supporters. In fact, he had no overall message. As Winston Churchill put it, there was no theme to his pudding. When I asked a White House aide about this, he pointed to what had been billed as a \major speech on the economy,\ at Georgetown University in April 2009. But the speech was utterly forgettable—and forgotten. One ally attributes this problem to the inexperience of both Obama and his top staff. An ally says, \You can't leave a message if you don't have a strategy and you don't know where you're going.\ Another says, \They had something that worked in the campaign but didn't work in the White House.\ Thus, Obama didnt see the need to explain what he was doing. His 2010 campaign themes seemed to wander all over the place: Stanley Greenberg, a pollster and former aide to Bill Clinton, said that Obamas oft-used theme, that we shouldnt go back to the Bush days, actually tested negatively, because people didnt believe that the country was making economic, progress. So Obamas biggest failure was not to be the leader that so many expected him to be. The jubilation that surrounded his swearing-in may have gone to his head, while the celebrants overlooked that there were plenty of people out there who were not overjoyed at the advent of a black president, or even a Democrat. Obama was, apparently in his own estimation, so smart and so adored that he seems to have felt no need to explain—and explain again—to the country what he was doing and to take the country along with him. This failure to put his programs across came up a few times in the 2010 campaign.... More than once, people in town hall meetings told him that they were behind him but were having great trouble trying to defend or explain his agenda. In a backyard gathering on October 21 he made the most awkward reply of those I heard: \Our attitude was that we just had to get the policies right and we didnt always think about making sure we got the advertising properly about what was going on.\ Advertising. (When I mentioned this to a Democratic senator who was generally supportive of Obama, this ordinarily polite man responded, \Bullocks! What policies?\) The risk-averse Obama had left it to Congress to write the big bills such as on the economic stimulus and health care (with strong participation by White House aides). But he kept up this line of defense all the way through to his pathetic press conference on the day after the election. In these comments, Obama gave away the devastating fact that he didn't really understand the role of the president as leader. A friend of the Obama administration said to me, \Their definition of governing is passing bills.\ Someone else relatively close to the White House explained that since Obama had been so criticized for being \arrogant\ and \aloof,\ he had to eat large portions of humble pie. (\And I take responsibility for that,\ Obama said again and again.)

C05762454	Dear Hillary, Hope you are resting comfortably. Please take this as an excuse to get much needed rest. Lots of people have expressed best wishes for you to me--Sean Wilentz, Joe Conason, Gene Lyons, etc--so if they haven't contacted you because you're behind a wall you should know that many, many people are thinking about you now. I spoke this morning to Gary Sick, who, you recall, was senior person on NSC during the Iran hostage crisis, and is now at Columbia. He has one of the best intelligence networks on Iran, 1,500 people, experts with extensive contacts, and many Iranians, deeply embedded in the unfolding events Gary tells me that Mousavi has evolved from a mild-mannered reformer to directly challenging the regime. Nobody, he says, knows where this will go, certainly not the Iranians. Khamenei has exposed himself and lost his aura of mystification, plunging into the arena as a political player. Mousavi has issued a new revolutionary manifesto, just translated; I enclose below Sick's report and analysis on it. This poses, Sick says, a new challenge to Khamenei. Does he let it stand? Does he answer it? Sick also says US diplomacy in fact can't accomplish anything with the regime until the crisis completely works its way out, which could take years. He points out that the first mass demonstrations against the Shah occurred a full year before his overthrow. He adds that the one thing the regime has learned fro m the Shah is not to be equivocal toward demonstrations. Two ideas, who knows, but here they are: 1. Though the regime uses Western protests to consolidate control, some of them contribute to its deep crisis of legitimacy. Sick says Obama's statement, for example, was good. He also cites a statement from Ban Ki Moon. If there would be a UN action, shouldn't it focus ont he human rights/violence aspect? A statement and/or resolution urging the regime to stop illegitimate violence of paramilitary militias? US shouldn't initiate. 2. Establish linkage in negotiations with Russians on Start between their objections to missile defense outposts in Poland and Czech Republic (especially if we plan to give them up) with Russian arms sales to Iran. Get well. See Sick analysis below. Sid 5ousavi's New Revolutionary Manifesto by Gary Sick June 21, 2009 I 10:51am — L Alfred, Sipa / AP Photo The Iranian protest movement reached a tipping point today, writes Gary Sick, • the key White House offical during the 1979 hostage crisis, and what has emerged is nothing short of a platform for a true Islamic democracy. Plus, read more insight on Iran's election from other Daily Beast writers. Today, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the presidential candidate who has come to represent the democratic aspirations of the Iranian people, issued a formal statement. Although he denounces the \lies and fraud\ of the leadership, particularly in the recent election, he views the fraudulent election as only as the symptom of something far more serious. He describes a revolution gone wrong, a revolution that was originally based on attention to the voice of the peo ple but has resulted in \forcing an unwanted government on the nation.\ It is apparent from this statement that Mousavi's movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously in the past week. This moment is \a turning point,\ he says, and he defines the movement that is forming around him as having a \historical mission\ to accomplish nothing less than \renewing the life of the nation\ according to its own ideals. He acknowledges, interestingly, that his own voice at the beginning was less \eloquent\ than he would have wished and that the people were ahead of him in turning the movement green. But now he accepts the \burden of duty put on our shoulders by the destiny of generations and ages.\ He denounces both extremes of the political spectrum: on one hand those who believe that \Islamic government is the same as Tyranny of the Rightful;\ and on the other, those who \consider religion and Islam to be blockers for realization of republicanism,\ i.e. those who believe that democracy is incompatible with Islam. Mousavi says his call for annulment of the election and a revote, supervised by an impartial national body, \is a given right.\ The objective is nothing less than \to achieve a new type of political life in the country.\ That is truly a revolutionary statement. He says he will stand by the side of all those seeking \new solutions\ in a n on-violent way. He accepts the principles and the institutions of the Islamic Republic, including the Revolutionary Guard and the basij, but denounces \deviations and deceptions.\ He demands reform \that returns us to the pure principles of the Islamic Revolution.\ He calls for freedom of expression in all its forms, and says that if the government permits people to express their views freely, \there wont be a need for the presence of military and regulatory forces in the streets.\ It is apparent from this statement that Mousavis movement—and Mousavi himself—have evolved enormously in the past week. The candidate started as a mild-mannered reformer. After the searing events of the past several days, he has dared to preach a counter sermon to Khameneis lecture on Islamic government. Although he never mentions the Leader by name, there is no overlooking the direct contradiction of his arguments. This open opposition to the Leader by a political figure is unprecedented. • Mousavi has in fact issued a manifesto for a new vision of the Islamic Republic. The repression and disdain of the government has brought the opposition to a place they probably never dreamed of going. And no one knows where any of the parties are likely to go next. But for outside observers, it is like standing on the edge of a glacier and feeling the ice begin to crack under your feet. Gary Sick served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan. He was the principal White House aide for Iran during the Iranian Revolution and the hostage crisis and is the author of two books on U.S.-Iranian relations. Mr. Sick is a captain (ret.) in the US. Navy, with service in the Persian Gulf North Africa and the Mediterranean.

C05760795	April 11, 2009 12pm Word count: 2,392 (19 min) Rooney (x7-7203, 202-431-6498) SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON REMARKS TO THE HAITI DONORS CONFERENCE Washington, D.C. Tuesday, April 14, 2009 For some of us, Haiti is a neighbor. For others, a place of historic and cultural ties. For all of us, a test of collective commitment and resolve. Some may ask why a small nation in the middle of the Caribbean Sea should command our attention today. Why countries in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, the Middle East and Asia should offer assistance to Haiti in the midst of a global economic downturn that has shaken us all. We're gathered at this conference because what happens in Haiti will resound far beyond the Caribbean and beyond the Americas. The success or failure of this one small nation has economic, social and political implications, not just for its 9 million citizens, but for a region whose future will be shaped by the strength of our commitment to achieve economic recovery, political progress and wider opportunity for people from Portland to Porto Alegre to Port-au-Prince. The United States is here, first and foremost, because it is the right thing to do for our neighbor and friend. Our ties to Haiti reach back to the early years of both our nations and have endured for generations-through our struggles for independence; through the defeat of slavery in Haiti, which inspired slaves and abolitionists in the U.S. to press on with their fight for freedom; and more recently, through the hundreds of thousands of Haitians who emigrated to the United States and strengthened it through their contributions in politics, business, science, sports and culture-the benefits of which I experienced firsthand as a senator representing New York. We are also here because we are committed to creating a hemisphere in which every nation-no matter their present level of wealth or current political circumstances-is moving in the same direction, toward greater peace, prosperity, freedom and opportunity. With Haiti, we have the chance through global cooperation and collaboration to stand in solidarity with a people who are seeking to march forward. A nation where small investments and assistance from other countries are beginning to reap dividends in economic growth, wider access to health care, stronger governmental institutions, greater safety and security-and the higher quality of life that results when the material conditions of people's lives improve. Today, Haiti is the poorest nation in the hemisphere, with one of the region's biggest gaps between the haves and have- nots. But in 2006, Haiti had its highest economic growth since the 1990s. It is on track to reach the completion point for the IMF's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the next few months, which means significant debt relief is on the way, which will free up approximately $4 million a month-money that Haiti can invest directly in improving the lives of its people and building a future of self-sufficiency and confidence. Haiti has the region's highest rate of HIV/AIDS, the highest rate of maternal mortality, and the highest rate of child mortality. But the numbers of HIV infections and child and maternal deaths are all coming down. Not long ago, Haiti endured three decades of a brutal dictatorship. But the national and presidential elections in 2006 jump-started Haiti's democracy, and President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis are seeking to maintain a strong commitment to democratic governance, which will take another step forward on Sunday with elections for the Senate. Like many nations, including the United States, Haiti struggles against crime, particularly the global scourge of drug trafficking. But reforms to improve policing, strengthen the justice system and fight corruption are now underway, and a peacekeeping force led by Brazil has helped bring stability to many Haitian communities. Haiti made these strides with help from its own citizens and many of the nations and institutions represented here today. And this progress did not come only through government-to-government partnerships, but also through links among businesses, universities, NG0s, religious and cultural groups, and individuals-the full range of resources and relationships, which is the heart of smart power. That trajectory of progress has been undermined by the combined winds of hurricanes and a global economic recession. Haiti is in danger of stalling. This conference gives us an opportunity to reignite its path to progress and work as a team-with Haiti at the helm-to advance a comprehensive, long-term strategy for Haiti's growth, by coordinating hemispheric and international efforts, targeting clear goals, and deploying our diverse skills and resources efficiently and effectively. President Preval and Prime Minister Pierre Louis have identified what help Haiti needs to get back on track. With these priorities as our guide and Haiti as our partner, we can make high-impact investments that will help lay the foundation for stronger democratic institutions, a vibrant civil society, and an open market economy that creates more stability, attracts international investment, and offers more jobs and wider economic opportunities for Haiti and our region as a whole. Now is the time to step up our investment in Haiti-not because the situation is so dire, but because the consequences of inaction could lead to significantly larger costs in both human and financial terms down the road. With $100, we can pay for a year of schooling for one Haitian child or immunize five. That's a tiny fraction of the cost of solving these problems if they escalate over time. The United States will target our support toward three areas that the Haitian government has requested, which are aimed at promoting conditions that are essential for national and regional progress. First, the Haitian people need to be secure. They must be able to travel safely to work and school and participate in the civic lives of their communities without fear of violence. Second, the country needs stronger infrastructure, particularly roads, which are the circulatory system of any robust economy. Meanwhile, the people of Haiti are ready to work, but jobs are in short supply. We can accomplish two things at once by putting people to work building roads and other infrastructure throughout Haiti. And third, last year's hurricanes blew a hole in the government's budget. Now Haiti is facing a huge deficit, which will make it harder to provide services in the short-term or fund major projects in the long-term. Their debt obligations further constrain their ability to lay the groundwork for the future. On each of these issues-security, jobs and infrastructure, and debt relief-the United States is lending its assistance and seeking to partner with other nations to maximize our collective impact. First, security. Effective international partnerships have already helped stem violence and improve security in Haiti. Cite Soleil, for example, was a no-man's-land for years, but today, violence has subsided and a new sense of freedom is felt in the streets. The Haitian National Police have been supported in their work by the UN peacekeeping operation in Haiti, which is the first in the hemisphere in which Latin American and Caribbean nations have participated. Brazil has led the mission with determination and skill. This level of engagement and collaboration is a major step forward for our region. But criminal networks operating in Haiti have not been eliminated. Haiti continues to fight drug traffickers who have made this country a distribution point for illegal drugs headed to the United States, Canada and Europe. Drug trafficking is a problem that involves many nations, all of which have a role to play in ending this deadly trade. That includes the United States. We will give $2 million to fight drug trafficking in Haiti through the Merida Initiative, a plan conceived by Mexico, Central America and the United States. This money will fund a secure communications network for the Haitian police; provide a maritime base, vehicles and operational support for police drug units; provide training to promote cross-border cooperation between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and sharpen the investigation and prosecution of drug crimes. Once security is established, opportunity can take root. Nations from Canada to Spain to Japan offered generous assistance to help repair the damage from last year's storms. Now it is time to take the next step-to move beyond peacekeeping and disaster relief to long-term reconstruction and development. Haiti has the highest unemployment rate in the hemisphere; 70 percent of its people don't have jobs. It also has one of the region's highest population growth rates. Together, these trends have created what one development expert has called a \youth tsunami\-nearly 1 million youths are expected to come into the job market in the next five years. To spur the creation of jobs, the United States passed the HOPE Act in 2006, to give garments made in Haiti tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Last October, we extended this trade preference for another decade. Apparel is one of the largest sectors in Haiti's economy. We see great potential for job creation in this field, and we are gratified by Brazil's interest in supporting the Haitian apparel industry as well. But to build a diversified economy, Haiti needs more than trade deals. It also needs the infrastructure to support the flow of goods and services. The roads in Haiti are beyond inadequate; many communities are isolated by the lack of a passable road, which prevents people from holding jobs, children from going to school, and farmers from bringing their crops to market. Better roads could facilitate greater trade and bring more Haitians into the global economy. Haiti also needs better roads in tourist areas, to promote that sector of the economy. Other urgent infrastructure needs include digging water catchments to prevent floods, completing a garment workers' training center, and creating canals to help irrigation. As part of the $287 million in non-emergency assistance we will provide to Haiti this year, we have authorized $20 million in aid to generate jobs, to help people put their skills to work building their country's future. We look forward to working with Haiti to distribute that money quickly and effectively, to trigger a virtuous circle for long-term economic growth. All the fiscal responsibility in the world can't prevent a natural disaster. The hurricanes didn't just wash away crops and houses; they also washed away months of government planning for the future. Haiti is facing an approximately $50 million budget deficit, which could undermine Haiti's long-term ambitions as well as services that people depend on to survive. The United States will provide $20 million to pay Haiti's upcoming debt service obligations, to free Haiti to use its resources to fill that budget gap. [There is a fourth urgent need that the United States is committed to helping Haiti resolve. The combined effect of rising food prices globally and the destruction of crops by the hurricanes have exposed millions of Haitians to malnutrition and its destructive effects on health and productivity. Malnourished people are often too weak to work; chronically hungry children struggle to learn in school. Food insecurity is not only a source of suffering, but a direct threat to economic growth and global stability. The United States will provide a $15-million in-kind contribution of food to help Haiti as it continues to rebuild. ] These are some of the ways in which the United States is ready to partner with Haiti and other nations. But there are additional pieces of the larger mission that need support-from helping Haiti adapt to climate change so future hurricanes won't claim thousands of lives; to strengthening health systems; promoting sustainable agriculture; and developing civil society. This work is not only a matter for governments, but also a mission for our people. Here in the U.S., I have heard from many individuals and groups who care about Haiti and want to help it develop but don't know how to invest their time and money in a way that will make a real impact. We should think creatively about helping people outside government get involved in a meaningful way with Haiti's future. Our people are our most valuable resource, and their potential to help in places like Haiti has not yet been tapped. We know from empirical data that small investments go a long way. This is something I've seen for myself in my own visits to Haiti. I traveled there with my husband shortly after our wedding, and again years later as First Lady. I met a doctor who had emigrated to the United States and became a U.S. Air Force Colonel, but returned to his home town of Pignon to run a center for health, women's literacy and microcredit. He and his staff had few resources, but they offered a comprehensive range of services to thousands of clients. I visited a family-planning clinic where young people were trained to educate their peers about how to protect their health and prevent teen pregnancy. And I met with women from a group called Women in Democracy. These women had attended a global conference on women's leadership in Montevideo, Uruguay, and when they returned home, they created this organization to support Haitian women running for office. Eleven years later, their organization is larger and stronger than ever, and so is their mission. In addition to supporting women candidates, they also hold trade fairs for women entrepreneurs, run civic education programs to teach women their rights, support women journalists, and build connections between women throughout the Caribbean. These Haitian women remind us that we will never achieve real progress if we leave millions of people behind. And they demonstrate a powerful commitment on the part of the Haitian people to participate in and lead their nation's recovery. Our role is to support their work however we can, and to demonstrate through our actions our belief that their future is as important as our own. What happens next in Haiti will send a message to the world about the power of collaboration on behalf of every poor nation that has worked hard to earn a foothold in the global economy but has tumbled in recent months. On behalf of every man and woman in the hemisphere, from the northern expanses of Canada to the southern tip of Argentina, who is working harder than ever with fewer resources and for smaller rewards. and the children whose futures have been jeopardized by forces far beyond their control. let us prove our commitment to an economic recovery that reaches not only the citizens of our individual nations but all people everywhere.

My EU contact writes that the Member States in the EU have been slowing up progress on trade concessions to Pakistan, although the draft language negotiated w/ Pakistan still leaves room for the Commission (which is pro-trade) to keep working on enhanced trade benefits for Pakistan. Still, the original timetable of 2011 will not be kept. Even more ominous, any agreement will have to go to the European Parliament, which is down on Pakistan for human rights reasons.

C05764359	Cc: Sullivan, Jacob J Madam Secretary, Attached and below please find a brief backgrounder on the United States Institute of Peace. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike United States Institute of Peace: Background Proposals for the creation of a government \peace\ agency stretch as far back as a proposal in 1792 to create a \Peace Office\ on par with the War Department. Between 1935 and 1976 over 140 bills were introduced in Congress to establish peace-related agencies, departments, bureaus, and committees of Congress. In 1979 Congress established the Commission on Proposals for the National Academy of Peace and Conflict Resolution. In 1981, the Commission — known as the Matsunaga Commission for its head, Senator Spark Matsunaga — recommended the creation of a national peace academy. In 1984, President Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act and the first meeting of USIP's Board of Directors took place in 1986. The USIP Act established \an independent, nonprofit, national institute to serve the people and the Government through the widest possible range of education and trainings, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence.\ USIP is an independent agency, funded by Congress, which serves as an intersection between those involved in policy research, fieldwork, and practitioners. More than 70 USIP policy experts conduct research on a wide variety of country- specific and cross-cutting functional issues. Some examples of USIP activities include: ® Working in countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to mediate and facilitate dialogue among parties in conflict, promote the rule of law, strengthen civil society and education systems, and educating the public through events, films, and other outreach. O USIP has given out $58 million in grants for over 1,700 peacebuilding projects in 76 countries. ® USIP hosts standing working groups of experts and practitioners on a variety of issues, including Sudan, Syria, Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Haiti. ® USIP has facilitated a number of task forces, including the Iraq Study Group and the recent Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, chaired by William Perry.

H Sent: Mon Sep 14 15:08:50 2009 Subject: Fwd: Left at the Gate - blog Hi Mrs. Secretary, I am chairman of AEG. I need your advice on a few matters. Is there a time that would be convenient for me to call or visit you? I shall be in DC Thursday evening through Monday. Please let me know if anything works. Thanks. Richard Mays Mays, Byrd & Associates, P.A. 415 Main Street Little Rock, AR 72201 fax - 501-399-9280 toll free 1-800-227-1529 Sent: 9/14/2009 10:57:14 A.M. Central Daylight Time Subj: Left at the Gate - blog Monday, September 14, 2009 Odds On the Big A <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/odds-on-big.html> Even as Governor Paterson reportedly has his recommendation on the Aqueduct racino in hand (this reader says that he actually has two to consider <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/09/sunday-morning-notes-and- nuts.html#comment-1156672372250588546> ), at least one of the bidders is still taking its case to the local community around the track. The Queens Chronicle reported last week <http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20368289&BRD=2731&PAG=461&dept_id=574908&rfi=6> that SL Green/Hard Rock made a presentation on Thursday. \Hard Rock is the right balance,\ [Pres/CEO Marc] Holliday said. \Its recognized brand and quality entertainment will attract younger and older players across the stratum. People flying in from JFK will say, I hear theres a Hard Rock, I want to see it.\ One of this group's big pitches is that they'll be the first to generate a revenue stream (\shovel-ready, in the ground, the day after the award.\) And thanks to the reader who alerted us to this article in Crain's <http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090913/FREE/309139964> which, more importantly than comprising yet another virtual press release for Steve Wynn, contains, towards the bottom, a handy pocket guide to the six bidders, the financial portion of their bids (or at least what is known about them), and the ups and downs of their proposals. This is a tough call; handicapping without the Form as I said before. I can't say I have a favorite; neither a particular personal preference, nor a clue as to the most likely winner. But I'll give it a shot and take the Crain's piece one step further by coming up with a morning line. <http://1.bp.blogspot.com/yiJ1ri4LCfk/Sq2_nTNU jI/AAAAAAAABHM/UucITWnkilM/s1600- h/dont_bother.jpg> Aqueduct Entertainment Group <http://www.aqueductentertainment.comk (3-1): Competitive bid of $251 million (contingent on 7,650 machines; $301 million with 10,000), a plethora of local connections on the real estate/construction side, and approval by local unions could compensate for the lack of brand name recognition of gaming partner The Navegante Group. Presence of Senator Malcolm Smith's longtime confidante Rev. Floyd Flake doesn't hurt either. SL Green/Hard Rock (4-1) - Boosted its bid to $275 million, and has the Hard Rock brand name as mentioned above. Manhattan-based realtor SL Green has been endorsed by several local unions <http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3601/is_43_54/ai_n27894917/> . But, as mentioned by Crain's, they were passed over in favor of Delaware North the first time around. Aqueduct Gaming (6-1), Buffalo-based Delaware North's group, has rallied late with a stepped-up publicity effort and a major community initiative <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/back-in-game.html> after appearing indifferent early on (though it's original $100 million upfront offer remains intact with an additional $200 million to follow). The addition of Harrah's <http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Aqueduct-Gaming-L1c-1034906.html> adds an experienced operator and an interesting cross-marketing twist which is probably not allowed under the now- disappeared MOU. And, like the two bidders above, Aqueduct Gaming has been reported to have reached accommodations with the unions. So I listed them as the third choice on these merits. However, a part of me wants to list them as the rank outsider - I'd be pretty damn shocked if the state goes back to the company which dropped out after failing to raise the money last time. And, as I've mentioned several times, given the reports of an investigation <http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/05/01/2009-05- 01_attorney_general_andrew_cuomo_subpoenas_contracts_won_by_clients_offirm_tied_to.html> by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo into lobbyist Patricia Lynch's dealings with the Assembly Speaker, I don't know if her involvement here is going to help or hurt. Steve Wynn (8-1) has offered $300 million, but he was the only bidder of the six contenders to receive a bad grade from the hotel unions <http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storylD=838256&category=STATE> as reported by Jim Odato in the Times Union last week. Whatsmore, the scale of his building proposal <http://www.queenstribune.com/news/1250798405.html> is laughably ridiculous, and it wouldn't be ready until 2011. He'd be the favorite if the decision is based on the number of newspaper and online articles <http://leftatthegate.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-wynn-all-of-time.html> each bidder has been featured in. But, quite simply, he sometimes comes off as a nut <http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/cindy_adams/wynn_hopes_to_win_racefor_race_hzqJ384wLxUSxFKsUWiSyM> . Penn National (12-1) might be worth a ducat at long odds. No local connection here makes them a dark horse. But a $250 million bid (as reported elsewhere <http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/17717/penn-national- lobbies-up/> though not in the Crain's piece) puts them in the ballgame, and the company is an experienced gaming operator with a solid balance sheet <http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/aug2009/pi20090814_742719.htm> which would probably do as competent a job as anyone else. R. Donahue Peebles/MGM Mirage (20-1) didn't increase its $150 million bid, and doesn't have a lobbyist; good luck with that. Whatsmore, no local flavor and MGM Mirage has had some well-publicized financial woes (though things have been looking up of late <http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125212120561188377.html> ). Would be a major surprise.

C05770761	FYI — from Morningstar: The Turkey-Azerbaijan Agreement was not signed last week in spite of both leaders having said that it would be. Erdogan and Aliyev are now saying June 7 or 8. We have learned that a serious commercial arose that needs to be resolved. I hope it will be but am making no predictions. One could also speculate that Medvedev's visit to Turkey may have been a factor. S should be aware of this. Thanks... Dick

C05769695	This is from the political officer in London: David Cameron will be given the right of reply after the PM's statement this afternoon -- followed by Q&A. UUP MP Sylvia Hermon is likely to be \unhelpful\ during the Q&A. The Conservatives are becoming exasperated by the rumors that appear in the press and elsewhere that they are unsupportive of the agreement. Our contacts say the Tories have been completely consistent in supporting the government on devolution, though they don't believe HMG handled the issue well (i.e. allowing the exclusion of the UUP and SDLP). Reg Empey is scheduled to meet his MLAs tonight to review the document and prepare for the working group with SDLP's Margaret Ritchie.
