Whether the Democrats have the ability and will to execute is a separate subject: \If it were done, when tis done, then twere well it were done quickly...\ Making Boehner the GOP poster child should be systematic and relentless. Tick, tock, another day gone. Sid September 3, 2010 Americans Most Likely to Favor GOP Newcomers for Congress Three in four believe influx of new members would improve Congress by Jeffrey M. Jones PRINCETON, NJ -- It appears that the best type of candidate to be this fall is a Republican challenger. Given a choice of four hypothetical candidates of differing party affiliations and experience, Americans are most likely to prefer \a Republican who has not served in Congress.\ Those who would prefer a Democratic candidate opt for an incumbent over a newcomer. These results, based on an Aug. 27-30 USA Today/Gallup poll, underscore the advantageous political environment for Republicans and non-incumbents this midterm election season. Overall, a majority of Americans prefer a Republican candidate (regardless of experience) to a Democrat, 53% to 40%. And a majority also prefer a non-incumbent (regardless of party affiliation) to an incumbent, 54% to 39%. The fact that Americans who prefer a Republican candidate want one who is new to Congress suggests that these voters want both GOP control of Congress and the new perspectives that come from members with no prior Washington experience. Americans who favor Democratic candidates, on the other hand, apparently are more satisfied with the type of experienced representatives now in Congress. One would naturally expect Democrats to prefer Democratic candidates, and Republicans to prefer Republican candidates, and that is the case when looking at the data by party. But partisans' preferences for incumbents versus challengers seem to be influenced by their knowledge that the Democrats currently have a majority in Congress, and thus, more Democrats will be defending House seats this fall. Democrats are more likely to prefer a Democrat who is in Congress to a Democrat who is not, and Republicans are more likely to prefer a Republican outside of Congress to one who is currently serving there. Independents also show a strong preference for Republican non-incumbents. The data do not necessarily indicate how Americans would vote in the fall when presented with a choice of two specific candidates for Congress. This fall, voters will generally be asked to choose between one Republican and one Democratic candidate, one of whom may be an incumbent. When asked in the same poll whether they are more likely to vote for the Republican or the Democratic congressional candidate in their district if the elections were held today, 48% of Americans say the Republican and 43% the Democrat. The appeal of non-incumbents is apparent in another question in the poll that finds 75% of Americans saying Congress would be changed for the better if \most of the present members of Congress are replaced with new members.\ Only 14% think that would make Congress worse. This is consistent with Gallup's findings from earlier this year suggesting strong anti-incumbent sentiment. Americans across key demographic subgroups widely share the belief that Congress would be improved if most members were turned out of office. However, there is a significant gap by political party, with 89% of Republicans versus 63% of Democrats saying that replacing most members of Congress would be beneficial. Again, the difference likely stems from Democrats' current status as the majority party in Congress. Implications In a year when Americans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation and give relatively low ratings to the president and Congress, it is not politically beneficial to be either an incumbent or a member of the ruling party. That is reflected in Americans' preference for a Republican newcomer over other types of candidates they may have a chance to vote for in this fall's midterm congressional elections. It is also reflected in prior analysis of historical Gallup data showing greater seat turnover in Congress when the president and Congress are unpopular.

C05765732	Hillary: This is the most provocative and significant analysis to come out of the recent election. Its author is a right-wing Republican lawyer based in Richmond who also writes a column for Human Events. I disagree with the ideological and partisan undercurrent of the piece, especially his overemphasis of the deficit as an overriding political factor rather than the administration's lack of achievable results so far in improving the living standards of ordinary people. There is no reason why the deficit shouldn't become a merely abstract factor once there are actual benefits delivered. The pattern of the past is that the deficit, the talisman of Hoover Republicans, moves only partisan Republicans and that Democrats ascend if the economy is progressing, its gains are widely spread and new social programs have favorable universal impact. That is not happening now. This analysis, therefore, may be portentous. Worth reading. The electoral maps of VA don't show up in the email but they are described. Sid Return to the Article November 13, 2009 Can the Clinton Coalition Survive Obama? By Sean Trende John Judis and Ruy Teixeira's well-regarded 2002 work The Emerging Democratic Majority begins with a vignette set in Virginia. They tell the story of a telecom executive named Mark Warner, who runs a moderate campaign that appeals to upper-middle class suburbanites and working class rural voters, and manages to put together a winning coalition that, if imitated in other states, might put the Democrats in power for decades to come. Democrats did build coalitions similar to Warner's, and in fact had been doing so for the better part of a decade. Warner's coalition was essentially Bill Clinton's 1996 coalition. The coalition and brand that Clinton built was an extraordinarily successful one for Democrats, breaking the momentum of a resurgent GOP in 1996, and ultimately enabling the election of the most liberal President in American History last year. Given this background, it's only appropriate that the first tangible sign that this coalition is coming unglued has come in Virginia. Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship with almost 59% of the vote — the highest percentage (though not the highest victory margin) for any governor since 1961. The entire Republican ticket won by similar margins, and the GOP picked up six seats in the General Assembly. It could have been even worse — five Democrats won their Assembly races by fewer than 1,000 votes. There are some superficial lessons to be drawn here. After last week's election, it's silly to argue that the GOP brand is too damaged for them to take advantage of Democratic weakness. And the Democrats' latest spin — that their weakness among Independents was simply a function of more Republicans calling themselves independents but retaining their Republican voting habits — puts the lie to the argument that Republicans' low self-identification is a salient factor in elections. But the most important lesson is this: while there's little predictive value in off-year elections, they do provide snapshots of the mood of the electorate, and the present state of political coalitions. Given Virginia's primacy in the story of Democratic coalition building, it gives us a good snapshot of the state of that coalition. And it's not a pretty one for Democrats. The historical base of the Democratic Party for two centuries has long been what Jay Cost and I call Jacksonians: Culturally conservative, hawkish, and populist whites located throughout the South and Border states. They began breaking away from Democrats in the 1950s and 1960s — their reaction to the Party's embrace of unions, blacks and liberals is a story is so well known there's no need to rehash it here. But this group remained at least in play for the Democrats. Clinton inherited a coalition consisting of minorities, liberals, urban voters, and a decent remnant of Jacksonian voters in the Ohio River Valley and the South, who still preferred a moderate-to-conservative Democrat to a Republican. This coalition became a majority coalition when Clinton used a combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board. This was a huge innovation for Democrats; suburbs like Nassau County, NY, Orange County, CA and Fairfax County, VA had fueled the rise of the Republican parties in those states. Clinton moved them substantially toward his side. This coalition allowed him to win by eight points in 1996; absent Perot and a last-minute fundraising scandal, he probably would have won by more. Clinton intuited that suburban voters are, generally speaking, culturally cosmopolitan — they don't like it when you call someone \macaca,\ and aren't crazy about the religious right. But they're generally not particularly socially liberal either, and are fans of \law and order.\ They like taxes low and appreciate economic growth, but like good schools and a clean environment. Having to balance a bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives, balanced budgets are the ultimate \good government\ indicator for these voters. Clinton delivered on all of these issues, keeping tax increases fairly small, and balancing the budget for much of his term. In so doing — and this is very important — he re-branded the Democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility, economic growth, moderate taxes, and smart government. In other words, he finally shed the \Carter\ label for the Democrats. This, in turn, made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for Democrats - one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him. George W. Bush's presidency, in turn, was an upper-middle class suburbanite's nightmare. An aggressive social agenda, a fiscal trainwreck, two poorly-managed wars and a financial collapse later, these suburban voters trended even more heavily Democratic then they were in the Clinton era. By 2008, Democrats held most of the suburban districts around , major metropolitan areas, and were threatening in the exurbs. The right Democratic candidate probably could have put together a massive 2008 Presidential majority, combining minorities, liberals, Jacksonians, Catholics, and suburbanites. The mood of the country was certainly right for a 1920/1932/1952/1980 result. But the Democrats nominated Barack Obama. The party's grip among Jacksonians had weakened since Clinton left the stage, but they abandoned Obama completely. Jay Cost and I have detailed this here. This movement is why Obama received 53% of the vote, instead of the 60% or so we might expect given the voters' attitude toward Bush's Presidency. Obama was able to win even without this branch of the Democratic party because he generated such intensity among the remaining portions of his base. In other words, while his base wasn't as broad as Clinton's, it was deeper. Faced with vanishing 401ks and home values, and disgust with Bush's presidency, suburbanites flocked to him. Liberals were enthralled to finally elect one of their own. And minorities turned out heavily for the opportunity to elect the first black President. But this presents a problem. You only get to elect the first black President once, and governing a coalition of suburbanites, poor blacks, and upper class liberals isn't easy. It is hard to keep that enthusiasm up. And with the Jacksonian wing of the party gone, if that enthusiasm dissipates, or if one of the coalition groups becomes disgruntled and starts to shuffle out the door, the party isn't left with much. We see a microcosm of this story in last Tuesday's elections, especially in Virginia. Let's backtrack to 2001, and look at the counties that Mark Warner won. The coalition that Warner built was similar to Clinton's. To oversimplify some, it blended together rural Democrats in the mining counties in the west of the state, college voters around Charlottesville, and black voters combined with rural whites in the south central and southeastern portion of the state with suburban voters in the northeast. It was a diverse coalition, but it worked. Now let's compare Warner's map with Obama's map in 2008: The suburbs stayed in the Democrat's camp, for reasons discussed above. But look what happens in the west! That area becomes solidly Republican. Buchanan and Dickenson counties in the Virginia panhandle voted for Dukakis, Mondale, and Adlai Stevenson (twice). Obama became only the second Democrat to lose these counties since the UMW moved in during the 1920s. As I said, this isn't a problem so long as (1) the Jacksonians show a willingness to come back for a candidate other than Obama and/or (2) the suburbs continue their love affair with the Democrats. But we see indications in Virginia that the Jacksonian divorce may, in fact, be permanent. Creigh Deeds was from the western section of the state, and seemed — at least on paper — capable of remaking the Mark Warner map. It didn't happen, obviously. Let's look at how Virginia changed from Bush's 2000 election to Deeds' loss last week: The redder a county is, the more it moved toward the Republicans from 2000 to 2009; bluer counties moved toward Democrats. We see that McDonnell did as well as Bush did in the suburbs — but no better. Those pockets of white are the DC suburbs in the northeast, the Hampton Roads area in the southeast, and Richmond just to the north and west of Hampton Roads. Its rural Virginia — which is still about 1/3 of the electorate — that made the difference between Bush's 54% in 2004 and McDonnell's 59% on Tuesday. Even with Obama off the ticket, and a much less cosmopolitan figure atop the ticket, rural Virginia went solidly Republican. We can take another angle here. Deeds and McDonnell squared off in a very close Attorney General race in 2005. Let's compare Deeds' 2005 showing to his 2009 performance. [NOTE: In this map, we look at \relative movement.\ Because everything in the state moved toward McDonnell, a map just showing \movement\ would be solid dark red, and not of much use. So instead, if something moved more than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is colored a shade of red, if it moved less than 9 points toward McDonnell, it is blue. Think of this as showing the change in the counties' PVI]. We see the same result. Just since 2005, rural Virginia has moved sharply against the Democrats. The suburbs haven't moved much at all, relative to the rest of the state, while the more heavily African American counties in the southern portion of the state have moved a few notches leftward (in absolute terms, they voted in 2009 as they had in 2005). This suggests lasting damage to the Democratic brand here that is not simply personal to Obama. Now let's look at how McDonnell did when compared to McCain in 2008. Again, because the movement here was so dramatic statewide, we need to isolate the biggest and smallest changes by looking only at \relative\ shifts. The western counties of the state didn't shift much from 2008, but that's because they were already giving Republicans around 70% of the vote — there wasn't much room for Republican growth (and remember, \blue\ in a relative map still means slight movement toward the Republican since 2008)! The real Republican gains over the past year have come in the DC exurbs, in the 1-95 corridor, and to a lesser extent in the Hampton Roads area. In other words, the Jacksonians aren't returning to the Democrats, at least in Virginia. Deeds might still have been able to win without them, but the Democrats are also showing weakness in the Virginia suburbs. In other words, two pieces of the Clinton-Warner coalition are starting to break away. This is a real problem for the Democrats. If the suburbanites and the Jacksonians move away from the party, there is very, very little left for them. And there's reason to think that the suburban weakness is real. Obama's fiscal policy, to make an understatement, hasn't been Clintonian. It may not be entirely his fault, but the $787 billion stimulus, the trillion dollar healthcare bill, the automobile bailout, and the budget showing trillion dollar deficits extending for the next decade make suburbanites shudder. They don't much like debt, and they intuit this spending is going to have to be paid for at some point — probably by them. Voters still give Obama some benefit of the doubt, as they do most Presidents in their first year, but they are becoming very, very worried, and probably don't put much stock in Candidate Obama's promise to enact a net spending cut any more. Democrats will doubtless chalk this up to Creigh Deeds' inept campaign. Deeds wasn't a great candidate, but when the mood of the country is starting to swing against your party, it is hard to run a good campaign. Jerry Kilgore found this out when he ran in a similar environment in 2005, and was reduced to attacking Tim Kaine for his religious views on the death penalty. And if you run the Deeds-McDonnell race in 2006 or 2008, I think its hard to argue McDonnell would win by 18 points, even holding everything else equal. The other problem with this explanation is that we saw similar results replicated around the country. Most of the seats in the House of Delegates that the Democrats lost in Virginia, or came close to losing, were suburban. The Philly suburbs voted Republican for the state Supreme Court. Bergen County New Jersey didn't give the Republican 60% of the vote like it did in 1984, but Chris Christie nearly carried it, and even though he is significantly more conservative than Christie Todd Whitman or Tom Kean, he won the largest margin for a first-term Republican Governor since 1969. Conservative Republicans won elections in Westchester County, New York, and Republicans picked up two City Council seats on the outskirts of Queens. Republicans won back the Nassau County legislature -- the Democrats' capture of that body figures prominently in the introduction to Emerging Democratic Majority -- and nearly defeated the Democratic County Executive there with an obscure, underfunded candidate. In other words, in places that have never heard of Creigh Deeds or seen his attack ads on McDonell's thesis, the Democrats still lost suburban voters. States with a Democratic base of liberals, urbanites, and minority voters -- like California and New York -- haven't moved much against Democrats. Obama's polling numbers, as well as those of Democratic candidates for Governor and Senator, in classic \Emerging Democratic Majority\ states like Colorado and Nevada are not looking good at all. And of course in Jacksonian states like Kentucky, he's below 40%. This doesn't mean that Democrats are doomed in 2010. An improved economy, Republican missteps, and a host of other factors could keep the band together for them. Maybe some of the more marginal voters that Obama brought to the polls to enact hope and change will return in 2010 to keep hope alive. But the personal nature of Obama's victory is starting to show its downside for downticket Democrats. The Clinton coalition is looking creaky. If Obama doesn't improve and the coalition comes apart, Democrats could find themselves weaker than they were even in the 1980s and 1990s. Sean Trende can be reached at strende@realclearpolitics.com.

C05739766	Associated Press Published September 21, 2012 BENGHAZI, lli3YA — Hundreds of protesters angry over last week's killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya stormed the compound of the Islamic extremist militia suspected in the attack, evicting militiamen and setting fire to their building Friday. In an unprecedented show of public anger at Libya's rampant militias, the crowd overwhelmed the compound of the Ansar Al-Sharlah Brigade in the center of the eastern city of Benghazi. Ansar Al-Shariah fighters initially fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but eventually abandoned the site with their weapons and vehicles after it was overrun by waves of protesters shouting \No to militias.\ \I dont want to see armed men wearing Afghani-style clothes stopping me in the street to give me orders, I only want to see people in uniform,\ said Omar Mohammed, a university student who took part in the takeover of the site, which protesters said was done in support of the army and police. No deaths were reported in the incident, which came after tens of thousands marched in Benghazi against armed militias. One vehicle was also burned at the compound. For many Libyans, the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was the last straw in one of the biggest problems Libya has faced since the ouster and death of longtime dictator Moamrnar Qaddafi around a year ago -- the multiple mini-armies that with their arsenals of machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades are stronger than the regular armed forces and police. The militias, a legacy of the rag-tag popular forces that fought Qaddafis regime, tout themselves as protectors of Libyas revolution, providing security where police cannot. But many say they act like gangs, detaining and intimidating rivals and carrying out killings. Militias made up of Islamic radicals like Ansar Al-Shariah are notorious for attacks on Muslims who dont abide by their hardline ideology. Officials and witnesses say fighters from Ansar Al-Shariati led the attack on the U.S. consulate, which killed Amb. Chris Stevens and three other Americans. After taking over the Ansar compound, protesters then drove to attack the Benghazi headquarters of another Islamist militia, Rafallah Sahati. The militiamen opened fire on the protesters, who were largely unarmed. At least 20 were wounded, and there were unconfirmed witness reports of three protesters killed. Earlier in the day, some 30,000 people filled a broad boulevard as they marched along a lake in central Benghazi on Friday to the gates of the headquarters of Ansar Al-Shariah. \No, no, to militias,\ the crowd chanted, filling a broad boulevard. They carried banners and signs demanding that militias disband and that the government build up police to take their place in keeping security. \Benghazi is in a trap,\ signs read. \Where is the army, where is the police?\ U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739766 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Other signs mourned the killing of Stevens, reading, \The ambassador was Libya's friend\ and \Libya lost a friend.\ Military helicopters and fighter jets flew overhead, and police mingled in the crowd, buoyed by the support of the protesters. The march was the biggest seen in Benghazi, Libyas second largest city and home to 1 million people, since the fall of Qaddafi in August 2011. The public backlash comes in part in frustration with the interim government, which has been unable to rein in the armed factions. Many say that officials attempts to co-opt fighters by paying them have only fueled the growth of militias without bringing them under state control or integrating them into the regular forces. Residents of another main eastern city, Darna, have also begun to stand up against Ansar Al-Shariah and other militias. The anti-militia fervor in Darna is notable because the city, in the mountains along the Mediterranean coast north of Benghazi, has long had a reputation as a stronghold for Islamic extremists. During the Qaddafi era, it was the hotbed of a deadly Islamist insurgency against his regime. A significant number of the Libyan jihadists who travelled to Afghanistan and Iraq during recent wars came from Darna. During the revolt against him last year, Qaddafis regime warned that Darna would declare itself an Islamic Emirate and ally itself with Al Qaeda. But now, the residents are lashing out against Ansar Al-Shariah, the main Islamic extremist group in the city. \The killing of the ambassador blew up the situation. It was disastrous,\ said Ayoub al-Shedwi, a young bearded Muslim preacher in Darna who says he has received multiple death threats because has spoken out against militias on a radio show he hosts. \We felt that the revolution is going in vain.\ Leaders of tribes, which are the strongest social force in eastern Libya, have come forward to demand that the militias disband. Tribal leaders in Benghazi and Darna announced this week that members of their tribes who are militiamen will no longer have their protection in the face of anti-militia protests. That means the tribe will not avenge them if they are killed. Activists and residents have held a sit-in for the past eight days outside Darnas Sahaba Mosque, calling on tribes to put an end to the \state of terrorism\ created by the militias. Militiamen have been blamed for a range of violence in Darna. On the same day Stevens killed in Benghazi, a number of elderly Catholic nuns and a priest who have lived in Darna for decades providing free medical services, were attacked, reportedly beaten or stabbed. There have been 32 killings over the past few months, including the city security chief and assassinations of former officers from Qaddafis military. Darnas residents are conservative, but they largely dont fit the citys reputation as extremists. Women wear headscarves, but not the more conservative black garb and veil that covers the entire body and face. In the ancient citys narrow alleys, shops display sleeveless women dresses and the young men racing by in cars blare Western songs. And many are impatient with Ansar Al-Sharjahs talk of imposing its strict version of Islamic law. The groups name means \Supporters of Shariah Law.\ \We are not infidels for God sake, We have no bars, no discos, we are not practicing vice in the street,\ said Wassam ben Madin, a leading activist in the city who lost his right eye in clashes with security forces on the first day of the uprising against Qaddafi. \This is not the time for talk about Sharjah.

One elder resident at the Sahaba Mosque sit-in, Ramadan Yousset said, \We will talk to them peacefully. We will tell them you are from us and you fought for us\ during the civil war against Qaddafi. But 'if you say no (to integrating into the) police and army, we will storm your place. It's over.\ Officials in the interim government and security forces say they are not strong enough to crack down on the militias. The armed factions have refused government calls for them to join the regular army and police. So the government has created a \High Security Committee\ aimed at grouping the armed factions as a first step to integration, Authorities pay fighters a salary of as much as 1,000 dinars, around $900, to join -- compared to the average police monthly salary of around $200. However, the militias that join still do not abide by government authority, and critics say the lure of salaries has only prompted more militias to form. Officials and former rebel commanders estimate the number of rebels that actually fought in the 8-month civil war against Gadhafi at around 30,000. But those now listed on the High Security Committee payroll have reached several hundred thousand. \All these militia and entities are fake ones but it is mushrooming,\ said Khaled Hadar, a Benghazi-based lawyer. The government is only making temporarily solutions, but you are creating a disaster.\ ### U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739766 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

C05771305	Financial Times FT.com Politics & Foreign policy Clintons aim is true as Democrats top gun By Edward Luce in Washington Published: October 12 2010 20:43 I Last updated: October 12 2010 20:43 Nobody would go so far as to call it a comeback. But Bill Clintons appearances on the midterm election trail are starting to turn voters heads in a way that Barack Obamas simply are not. Democratic operatives say that Mr Clinton, who went through in 1994 the kind of setback that pollsters say Mr Obama will face in less than three weeks, is more effective at presenting the election as a choice between starkly different alternatives rather than a referendum on what people think of the Obama administration. So far the president, who has booked most of the next three weeks for campaigning, has been unable to pull that off. This week alone, Mr Clinton has shaken up two Senate races — in Kentucky and West Virginia — with appearances that have assisted Democratic candidates. Mr Clinton was due to speak in Las Vegas on Tuesday night to assist the embattled Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and then move onto California later in the week. \Bill Clinton is about as close to a secret weapon as the Democratic party has got,\ says Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \He has this ability to fire up the Democratic base that almost nobody else can do right now.\ Mr Clintons intervention in Kentucky, where Jack Conway, the Democratic candidate, is locked in a tight race with Rand Paul, the Tea Party icon, is a good case in point. At the weekend Mr Clinton described Mr Paul, who wants drastically to shrink the size of the US federal government and has talked of abolishing the Federal Reserve, as a \radical with no record to back it up\. Mr Paul, who has never run for elected office, hit back by reminding voters of Mr Clintons former Monica Lewinsky scandal. \I am not sure I would trust a man who had sex with an intern,\ said Mr Paul. \I mean, do you think he's an honourable person?\ Mr Pauls trip down memory lane appears to have backfired. Few voters seem to care any longer about a scandal that occurred amid what in retrospect looks like a golden age of balanced budgets, job creation and the absence of foreign wars. \Bill Clintons strength is that he knows how to fight back and turn adversity into advantage,\ says Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic operative. \He is also able to enter an individual race, take the temperature, understand what people are feeling and then base his appeal to voters on that.\ In the West Virginia Senate race, where Joe Manchin, the governor, is trailing John Raese, a wealthy local businessman, Mr Clinton on Monday came out punching. Referring to Mr Raese's plush Florida vacation home, the former president said: \Im here for a lot of reasons. One is that I dont think its fair for West Virginia to have one senator and Florida to have three.\ Acknowledging voter anger in a state where Mr Obama has 29 per cent rating, among the lowest in the country, Mr Clinton added: I am old enough to know that if you make a decision when you are mad — and I am not just talking about politics here — there is about an 80 per cent chance you will make a mistake.\ In contrast, a lot of Democrats are critical of the way Mr Obama has framed the midterm campaign, shifting from one attack line to another without sticking to an overarching narrative. Last month, Mr Obama turned on John Boehner, the Republican congressional leader, in what looked like a move to depict him as the voters' alternative. More recently, Mr Obama has switched to attacking the Chamber of Commerce for allegedly funnelling foreign money into attack ads. But it has generated a lot of criticism. \This election is awash with undisclosed money and its fair to point out how disadvantaged the Democrats have been,\ says one consultant. \But it isnt good politics at this late stage when voters clearly want to hear about the economy.\ Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

More like a pivot, as far as her torso could fold forward to minimize the space between their heads. Was like the dental hygienist rolling around the floor to get the best access to your mouth depending on what tooth she was trying to get access to I've never seen a Westerner invade her space like that And even the non Westerners I've seen do it based on cultural differences have been only briefly to greet, This went on like that for 51 minutes - unacceptable in any culture.

C05766014	There are a number of different possibilities for how the decision on the Guinea/Madagascar credentials may go tomorrow. (It is Zambia and Tanzania bringing the challenge on behalf of the AU.) I was under the impression that we would not have to vote on the potential credentials challenges. We may have to. We may have to vote on a motion to *deny* them credentials and exclude them. For the moment, the guidance is to vote to credential all countries — including these two — as is customary, while conducting outreach with Tanzania, Zambia, and the AU to exnlain that WP have our own imnpratives hut ma cunnnrt thp fart that they are taking a principled stand. We may have to vote on a motion to *defer* decision, which would allow them to be seated and vote but would not formally grant credentials. For the moment, the guidance is to potentially support such a motion — this was the practice with respect to South Africa between 1983 and 1994. Everyone is in the same place on this. Ultimately, however, the whole thing may die of its own weight. This is probably the most likely outcome.

C05778447	The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloomberg's online and print media properties — including Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg.corn and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page. got December 15, 2010 loomberg to Publish Editorials By ,IERE-:EviY PE.TEP.S Being mayor of New York City would be a large enough platform for just about anyone. But apparently not for Michael R. The mayor's company, 3loomber, ,3 L.P., said on Wednesday that it would begin publishing editorials across its vast media enterprise in an effort to broaden the company's influence on national affairs. And though Mr. Bloomberg has an agreement with the city to have no involvement in the \day-to-day operations\ of his company, the endeavor, called Bloomberg View, is intended to channel his personal philosophy and worldview. \I think its very important that everyone understands that our editorial page is going to be, for sure, consistent with the values and beliefs of the founder — even if he happens to be mayor of New York City,\ said Matthew Winkler, the editor in chief of Bloomberg News. \I fully expect us in our Bloomberg View always to reflect those values. In fact, I want people to come away from reading the Bloomberg View infused with those beliefs and values.\ The effort presents a host of conflict-of-interest questions for the mayor. The new venture provides the mayor with yet another potent communications apparatus — one that carries his name and imprimatur — to sound off on issues that collide with his job as mayor, his corporate interests and his expanding philanthropic empire. Bloomberg L.P. executives said they would not shy away from publishing editorials on issues in which Mr. Bloomberg has a direct interest as mayor, like education, public health and environmental policy. Mr. Winkler said the editorials would not avoid such issues but would disclose the mayors involvement when warranted. Though Mr. Bloomberg will not have a hand in conceiving and writing the editorials, he is likely to offer feedback from time to time before they are published, Mr. Winkler said. \I think that there's a very good chance that's going to happen,\ he said, referring to Mr. Bloombergs occasional involvement. It is unclear whether that level of involvement is permitted under his agreement with the city to remain at arms length from the company. A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said the mayor was allowed limited involvement in his agreement with the city. \Weighing in from time to time is consistent with his being the majority shareholder of the company he founded,\ he said. As someone whose presidential ambitions are the source of endless speculation, acquiring the platform of an editorial page is certain to draw more attention to Mr. Bloombergs plans. (On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg ruled out a run for president.) The unsigned editorials will appear in all of Bloombergs online and print media properties — including Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg.com and the nearly 300,000 financial data terminals leased to Wall Street traders and businesses around the world. It will be run by two distinguished voices: James P. Rubin, a former assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, and David Shipley, editor of The New York Times Op-Ed page. Opinion and commentary have not typically been areas of focus for Bloomberg, with its just-the-facts approach. In fact, the mayor has complained about the corrosive effect of the 24-hour news cycle and overheated political commentary in the blogosphere. But company leaders, including Mr. Bloomberg, who has been aware of the project since it was conceived more than two years ago, saw an opportunity to extend their influence. For a firm that has made no secret of its ambitions to become the most influential media company in the world, starting an editorial operation is the latest effort to propel it beyond its core mission as a financial news service. The notion of media barons using editorials to shape public opinion and policy according to their personal views is an old one in American journalism. William Randolph Hearst, for example, often wrote front-page editorials for his newspapers. Mr. Bloomberg, it would seem, is casting himself in that mold, though there are no plans for him to begin writing signed editorials. For now, he is content letting his trusted deputies speak for him. \He's accepting and embracing the privilege of a media mogul,\ said David Nasaw, a professor of history at the City University of New York Graduate Center, who wrote a biography of Hearst. \This is what we all do. We try to persuade the rest of the world we are right. Of course we don't have the vehicles to do so. The rich have the vehicles to do so.\ Mr. Winkler said: \There's a huge opportunity here for Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg News to seize the day, literally seize the day by bringing wisdom to events as they unfold. And one can't always do that with the best result with reporting.\ \That certainly is a benefit to the founder of the company, the man. But it is also a huge opportunity for Bloomberg, the company, that it should take advantage of,\ Mr. Winkler added. Bloomberg L.P. acquired BusinessWeek last year, giving the 29-year-old company a print product with a long legacy of accomplishment. Bloomberg is in the midst of an expansion in Washington. With a service called Bloomberg Government, an operation that will eventually employ 300 journalists and analysts, the company will sell, for $5,700 a year, information about government services and contracts to lobbyists and others with business interests in the nations capital.

C05768992	FYI, early read out of Pakistan media reaction to strategic dialogue. Not bad overall at this point. Pakistan Media: Coverage of the final round of the U.S.-Pak Strategic Dialogue dominated the front pages of all newspapers and hourly bulletins of TV networks on Friday morning. Media highlighted reports that the U.S. and Pakistan sought \wide-ranging, long term and substantive partnership,\ and \established a policy steering group for further talks on strategic issues.\ The signing of a letter of intent between the U.S. and Pakistan to help reconstruction of priority roads in Malakand division also received prominent display. Secretary of Defense Gates meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, and his comments that the \U.S. wants to increase the military funding of Pakistan\ received coverage. Pak Army Chief General Kayanis remarks that the \military is willing to forgo its requests for hardware to ensure that Pakistans energy and economic needs are met\ were also reported. Reports that GOP and the opposition are not on same page regarding talks with the U.S. received front-page display. The civilian nuclear deal issue made news as \The News,\ reported that the \FO seeks to hide unease over nuclear snub\ and \The Nation,\ reported on front-page that \U.S. affirms durable partnership but no civilian N-deal.\ However Foreign Office spokesman's remarks, that the \government is optimistic about a positive outcome\ was also reported. Terming the U.S. commitment of $125 million for the power sector, as \crucial,\ \The News,\ noted in its editorial that \it needs to be translated into action urgently.\ Its sister mass- circulated Urdu daily, \Jang,\ however noted with a word of caution, that \we think that the present U.S. overtures to woo Pakistan are not completely altruistic. It remains to be seen what Washington wants from Islamabad.\ A prominent columnist, Ayesha Siddiqa noted in \Dawn,\ that \the U.S. might have realized that it will have to listen to Pakistan and feel concerned about its inherent insecurity vis-a-vis Indias role in Afghanistan.\

C05768439	UUP policing meeting with McGuinness breaks down after three minutes Latest row comes on eve of critical vote in Stormont assembly on transfer of justice powers from London to Belfast • Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent • quardian.co.uk, Monday 8 March 2010 17.36 GMT • Article history A meeting between the Ulster Unionists and Northern Irelands deputy first minister aimed at securing the partys support for the devolution of policing and justice broke down in acrimony this evening. The encounter between Martin McGuinness and a UUP delegation lasted all of three minutes at Stormont. The latest row comes on the eve of a critical vote in the Stormont assembly on transferring justice and policing powers from London to Belfast. The UUP has indicated it will not support the last act of devolution because they believe the entire power-sharing executive is dysfunctional. Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, told the Guardian last month his party would not support the transfer of these powers unless it obtained concessions on education — specifically the retention of academic selection to grammar schools at 11. Following the aborted meeting today, the UUP released a statement condemning both McGuinness and Peter Robinson, the first minister, who is leader of the rival Democratic Unionist party. The UUP claimed it had been ejected from the deputy first ministers office. A UUP spokesman said: \An ill-tempered deputy first minister attempted to aggressively lecture the Ulster Unionist party on policing and justice. He ridiculously accused us of being an anti-agreement party. Our delegation robustly reminded the deputy first minister that we were the party which brought power-sharing government to Stormont. \Quite clearly dissent and disagreement are unacceptable to Sinn Fein — unfortunately for Mr McGuinness, a party voting against a motion with which it disagrees is basic, normal democratic politics.\ The spokesman added that McGuinnesss \angry and aggressive attempt to lecture\ the UUP was \wholly unacceptable\. \When challenged on his tone, the meeting broke down. The UUP will not take lectures on our commitment to devolution from Martin McGuinness. \If this is how Sinn Fein understands power-sharing, then it is small wonder that the [Northern Ireland] executive is dysfunctional.\ If the DUP and Sinn Fein press ahead with the vote it is highly likely that the leader of the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance party, David Ford, will become the first justice minister for Northern Ireland. The SDLP will back the transfer of policing and justice powers in the Assembly tomorrow. However the nationalist party is angry that it is not being offered the justice ministry. Under the rules governing the hand-out of ministries in the power- sharing government the SDLP are officially entitled to choose the next ministry. The party opposes the appointment of Ford as justice minister but will still support the transfer of these powers as they want to be seen to continue to back the power-sharing arrangement. US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failed Ulster police deal Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month • Nicholas Watt, chief political correspondent • guardian.co.uk, Sunday 7 March 2010 22.12 GMT • Article history US secretary of state Hillary Clinton is said to be concerned at Cameron's apparent failure to exert pressure on his UUP partners. Photograph: Karim Jaafar/AFP/Getty Images David Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be \emboldened\ to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade the Tories' Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process. In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories' electoral pact with the UUP, a bipartisan group of US Congress members have demanded Cameron must \aggressively\ encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday. \At this defining moment in the peace process, it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about their shared future,\ the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron. Without a unanimous vote, they said, the province's elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the people they represent, and to the world. \Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will continue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of bringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability.\ The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the Guardian before the crucial vote on last month's Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists. A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British government has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. The congressmen and women, whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn the UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal. A Tory source said: \David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are for the parties in the executive, working as a four-party coalition, to decide. We hope that between now and Tuesday any outstanding issues can be solved.\ The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist and Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly. Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, will meet his party's executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote. The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUP's 36 assembly members account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP, seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it, would destabilise many members of the DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers. US eyes on Northern Ireland in countdown to crucial peace vote Hillary Clinton, the White House and Congressional leaders look for a yes vote in Belfast By Nick Watt Guardian For a few hours tomorrow, the United States will turn its attention to Northern Ireland. Democratic and Republican leaders will both be watching to see whether all mainstream political parties endorse the final stage in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement: the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers. Sir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, is meeting his executive tonight to decide whether to vote yes. Empey has severe doubts about the deal between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party. This would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month — a key nationalist demand — in return for the long-standing unionist demand for a review of the way in which contentious parades are run. Intense pressure is being placed on Empey to fall into line. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state who has taken a keen interest in Northern Ireland since the peace process was launched in the early days of her husband's presidency, spent 15 minutes talking to Empey by phone, according to BBC Northern Ireland. But transatlantic pressure has also been brought to bear on the other side of the Irish Sea. I reported this morning that a group of bipartisan US Congressmen have written to David Cameron asking him to use his influence with the UUP, which recently formed an electoral pact with the Tories, to vote yes. The unease among the US Congress members is shared by Hillary Clinton. She is said to believe that Cameron would be well advised to follow the example of John Major, who was respected as an impartial referee. The concerns in the US will raise questions about claims made in private recently by William Hague. The shadow foreign secretary is saying that, despite their political differences, he is forging a strong bond with Clinton. But all sides need to be careful. The Tories, who support the deal between Sinn Fein and the DUP, believe that ministers need to be careful about frightening the UUP with too much political pressure. The government was this morning trumpeting a poll, commissioned by them, which showed overwhelming support among UUP voters for a yes vote. But, as Slugger O'Toole notes, there is some debate about the methodology. \It almost feels like the government want the UUP to vote no so they can draw one of Gordon Browns beloved dividing lines and say we are to blame for it all going wrong,\ one Tory tells me.

C05775285	Jake probably passed this on to you, but just in case, I think it's definitely worth reading A few comments from one of my staff members who has long experience with the Middle East follow. From Martin: The principle conclusion from a quick visit to Israel and Ramallah over the weekend is that Netanyahu is in a strong position politically, with an unusually stable ruling coalition. Nobody I spoke with believed that the government would have fallen if he had decided to extend the settlement freeze before its expiry, as a gesture to U.S. peacemaking efforts. In their view, he could have easily garnered the support of a large majority of the people, for whom the settlers are a marginal concern. And this would have given him leverage over his ministers to ensure their support or abstention in the cabinet. As Dan Meridor noted, Likud voters are to the left of their Knesset members when it comes to peacemaking (70 percent support the two-state solution, vs only 50 percent of the leadership). Lieberman, not the Likud, is Bibi's chief concern. He wants to keep him in the government for as long as possible for fear that when he leaves he will garner the support of those on the right, including from the Likud, who oppose peacemaking. For the time being, Bibi uses the threat of an alternative coalition with Kadima to keep Lieberman in the tent. But the clock is ticking. According to Tzipi Livni, she can bring her party into the government now, and is willing to do so without any demand for \rotation,\ provided Bibi is serious about negotiating peace. But as the elections grow closer, more and more of her party members are turning against the idea of joining the government. They are strengthened in their views by recent internal polling which shows Kadima with 32 seats (up from 28 now), Likud slightly down at 25, and Labor at only 5. Therefore, if Bibi intends to make a deal with Abu Mazen, he will need to do so sooner rather than later. The longer he waits, the less leverage he has on Lieberman and the more likely Lieberman will break away to oppose him in the next elections. In this context, Bibi's negotiating tactics become self-defeating. Believing that he is a great negotiator, and that he is operating in the Middle East bazaar, he inflates his requirements well beyond anything reasonable in the belief that this is the best way to secure the highest price. The process of bringing him down to a reasonable price uses up a lot of energy, uses up a lot of goodwill, humiliates his Palestinian negotiating partner, and raises doubts about his seriousness. In the end, under great pressure from all quarters, he will make the final concession, but only after wasting a lot of time, making everybody furious with him, and thereby securing no credit either with his supporters or negotiating partners. At heart, he seems to lack a generosity of spirit. This combines with his legendary fear of being seen as a \freier\ (sucker) in front of his people to create a real problem in the negotiations, especially because he holds most of the cards. This is further complicated by his introduction of the notion of \creative ideas.\ Thinking out of the box, as he likes to do, will only further delay the negotiations because the box is already well-defined. To attempt to broaden the parameters will generate mistrust of his intentions on the Palestinian side just when direct negotiations provide the opportunity to build trust. The reason for dwelling on Bibi's psychology rather than his politics is that the latter all point in the direction of making a deal: the Israeli public is ready to get on with it; if Israel doesn't make a serious move, it will further delegitimize its standing internationally (something Bibi is deeply concerned about); Bibi needs President Obama in his corner to deal with the threat from Iran and to avoid punishment by the voters for mishandling relations with the U.S.; and if he doesn't make the deal with Abu Mazen now, he will have helped to advance the future he is most concerned about - a llamas takeover of the Palestinian leadership. Yuval Diskin was quite clear about this latter point. After praising the Palestinian security services to the sky (unusual for him) he told me that he had warned Bibi that at the moment they have a high motivation to prevent terror because they believe they are building their state. If that proves to be an illusion, the motivation will disappear and then he cannot guarantee security in the West Bank. He considers it quite possible that if Bibi doesn't quickly demonstrate his seriousness to Abu Mazen, he will resign because his honor has now been seriously damaged. He told Bibi that he cannot predict who will lead the Palestinians if Abu Mazen resigns, but that Salam Fayyad will likely have to go too. What is to be done? I have no magic solution for what must be a deeply frustrating exercise for you. And please forgive me if what I recommend here is just repeating what you already know. 1.Put your arm around Bibi: he still thinks we are out to bring him down. There is no substitute for working with him, even though he makes it such a frustrating process. But the purpose of embracing him is to nudge him forward, not to buy into his exaggerated political fears or accept his inflated demands. 2. Try to find a way to make him understand that his negotiating tactics are counterproductive to his own purposes. The Obama Administration has done a great deal lately to underscore its concern for Israel's security, from the vote at the IAEA, to the sanctions on Iran, to the letter that Obama was willing to sign that accepted Bibi's security requirements. That should buy you credibility with him. 3. As his friend, paint a realistic picture of the strategic consequences of his negotiating tactics, particularly in terms of what is likely to happen to the PA leadership if he worries only about his politics and not at all about Abu Mazen's politics. 4. If all else fails, avoid recriminations in favor of a \clarifying moment.\ The world will of course blame Bibi. But you should avoid any kind of finger-pointing in favor of a repeated commitment to a negotiated solution and a willingness to engage with both sides in trying to make that happen, when they're ready. The Israeli public and the American Jewish Community should know how far the President was prepared to go and they should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. Bibi, Abu Mazen, and the Arab states need negotiations and time is not on the side of any of them. They will come back to the table sooner rather than later as long as we keep the door open.

Karzai is preparing to announce his intention to proceed with the election on schedule. He has lined up Qanooni in support. SRAP is preparing a memo of potential options for how to move forward on this. When we have the memo I will be sure to get it to you pronto. If Paul has anything to add/amend, I will be sure to let you know.
C05761608	I'm usually the pessimist, but I'm not sure this is as dire as it seems in the moment from 10,000 miles away. First, the world/media is fixated on the President's speech, the imagery from Riyadh dominates, there's no Honduras footage of interest, which is key. Speech tomorrow will blanket coverage and extinguish the Cuba stuff, so we just need to weather the night. Second, Tom & Dan did an on the record conf call not long ago and we think they did very well. Dan was especially strong, and he's also speaking to people 1:1 Third, your statement was strong and the reporting will catch up with it, it's only been out 90 minutes. Fourth, we are suffering from two significant tactical problems: 1) you are here and removed 2) our press corps was out of position today and in flight, so the people we worked on all week and the ones likely to skew our way were replaced by reporters not connected to us. The two issues above will be rectified tomorrow in your two interviews - especially Greta who is malleable. We can use that to make a strong case on the principle, and the simple fact Cuba wasn't in the OAS yesterday, and won't be tomorrow. Everyday that passes reinforces that point. The time difference to East Coast will help us in moving whatever is said in these interviews tomorrow. Short term, we started the week showing we can engage with Cuba (mail, migration), and ending it showing we are serious about our redlines Long term, we stood up for human rights and that can only be a plus.
C05765794	sbwhoeop Tuesday, November 17, 2009 8:57 AM H FYI: Lead FT editorial today, must if you haven't read. Sid Financial Times FT.com OMMENT editorial US fumbling for a new China tone Published: November 16 2009 20:39 I Last updated: November 16 2009 20:39 Gone are the days when the US president could visit Beijing as the unassailable top dog, able to lecture the Chinese on everything from human rights to an overvalued currency. As has become fashionable to note, events have instead obliged Barack Obama to play the role of washed-up debtor visiting his stern bank manager for yet another loan. That analogy is useful. But it can be overdone. Certainly, the financial crisis has brought into sharp relief just how dependent the US has become on foreign creditors, chief among them China. It has also sharpened the perception of what had been happening anyway, the relative decline of a US-centric west and the relative rise of a China-centric Asia. But the word relative is important. China, poor and riddled with internal contradictions, is not there yet, by a very long way. The changing relationship with China does demand a new tone. But early indications are that Mr Obama is still fumbling for the right one. Take global imbalances. In the only set-piece speech of his Asian tour — delivered in Japan, perhaps to assure his hosts that Washington is not abandoning Tokyo just yet — Mr Obama correctly pointed out that the global economy cannot go back to business as usual. \One of the important lessons this recession has taught us is the limits of depending primarily on American consumers and Asian exports to drive growth,\ he said. That is quite right. But his entreaties on global rebalancing fall flat in China. That is partly because Beijing remains publicly sceptical about the US's long-term finances. From China's perspective, Mr Obama's emergency measures to stimulate the US economy and persuade Americans to spend their way out of recession smack of re-creating the spendthrift ways that triggered the crisis in the first place. That explains why Chinese officials have quizzed their US counterparts so robustly about how they intend to pay for healthcare reform. It is also why Beijing has started questioning US monetary, as well as fiscal, policy. On the eve of the US president's visit, Liu Mingkang, China's chief banking regulator, took a swipe at the US Federal Reserve, saying the combination of a weak dollar and low interest rates risked generating a global asset bubble. That is a bit rich coming from someone who oversees a banking system that has pumped the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of gross domestic product into the economy so far this year. But it reflects the new tone with which China presumes it can address a humbled superpower. Mr Obama's efforts to occupy the moral high ground are also undermined by his flirtation with protectionism, particularly his decision to slap tariffs on Chinese tyres. His administration has failed to spell out a convincing trade policy — and that is seen as a stark omission for-a business- oriented Asian audience. Such perceived deficiencies have hobbled his ability to cajole China with any real conviction. When it comes to human rights, too, the US seems to have drawn the conclusion it is not good policy to badmouth its chief creditor. Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, set the tone early when she said that human rights should not \interfere\ with matters of implicitly greater urgency. Mr Obama obligingly omitted all references to Tibet, Xinjiang and even Taiwan from his Tokyo speech. There was also not a single mention of India, a potential regional counterweight to China, yet another indication that Washington is behaving as though it is treading on eggshells. It was therefore all the more refreshing to hear Mr Obama criticise Chinese censorship during his town hall meeting in Shanghai on Monday — though even that could not undo his own self-censorship in refusing to meet the Dalai Lama before this week's trip. It is right and proper that the US acknowledge the rising significance of China. Mr Obama's assurances that China's rise need not be a threat were spot on. But by the same token, US accommodation can be taken too far. Contrary to common perception, China's huge holdings of US treasuries are not a sign of great strength. They are evidence of how dependent Chinese growth has been on the US consumer. Equally, any idea that China, with an economy less than a third the size of the US and a GDP per capita roughly the same as Angola's, can somehow save the world is ludicrous. Mr Obama is right to show respect to China. He need not — and must not — kowtow. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2009. Print a single copy of this article for personal use.

C05760254	The following is from an observer who I think is right about the need for more strategy time which means we have to have a better balance about travel time. I'd like your reactions. Thx. \When it comes to foreign policy, all see you doing a great job. You must be literally killing yourself— I can see your schedule is bruising. But you probably need more strategy time, less events as the ultimate judgment will be on • whether iran, nk get the bomb, progress in Mideast, success in Afghanistan, Iraq. Obamas pause on Afghanistan goes well with elite media and left that is against all wars, but not with swing male voters who are defecting. And I think it is making the rest of your job much tougher because the delay in the decision is looking Carterlike to US adversaries — any decision is better than no decision. But all roads likely lead to Iran and perhaps Pakistan, rest is secondary at this point. Thats my view for what its worth. Take care.

C05772152	HRC: [Huma can you print for HRC] Melanne is stepping through the QDDR and giving specific edits on each section to ensure the integration of gender. In addition to that help, she shared her thoughts/concerns on the reorganization as it affects s/GWI. We already determined from your earlier feedback that S/GWI would maintain a direct report to S (I actually always thought that even with the reorganization of homes for many of the S offices, we still were maintaining a direct S/reporting so we are revisiting this issue writ-large for the next draft to you. For example, we now know statutorily that S/CT legislatively is a required S report). That said, here is her narrative for your review for when we speak. I have embedded comments in caps in text after each graph where relevant. TO: Anne-Marie Slaughter FROM: Melanne Verveer DATE: November 4, 2010 RE: Gender Integration in the QDDR The Secretary has declared time and time again that the empowerment of women is \at the heart of the foreign policy of the United States.\ Our collective task is to realize this principle by integrating gender into the policies and programs of the State Department and USAID in an enduring way. We are concerned that the current draft of the QDDR falls short of this call. In the existing draft, the Office of Global Women's Issues falls under a new Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights while retaining the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports directly to the Secretary. This new structure misses the simple but important reality that women are half of the world's population and that the major security, economic and social challenges of this century cannot be solved without them. These issues cut across the work of the department and touch virtually all regions, though we place special emphasis on regions in which women and girls are most vulnerable, such as in countries experiencing conflict and transition. Locating the office within one bureau makes it impossible for the Office to implement its very charge — to integrate gender effectively into the work of the entire State Department. Therefore, gender must be integrated throughout all of the regional and functional bureaus rather than located within one bureau. Women should be integral to all of our diplomatic efforts—from traditional bilateral and multilateral relationships, strategic dialogues, and public diplomacy, to our relations with civil society, community leaders and other non-state actors. Women are also important to consider in all of our policy initiatives, including global health, food security, climate change, economic issues, human rights, and peace and security. We must institute rigorous institutional mechanisms to ensure that all bureaus, both regional and functional, consider gender in diplomacy and development. In order to integrate gender effectively throughout the work of the Department, we recommend the following approach to planning, budgeting, structure and evaluation: Maintain visibility and focus on gender. Retain the Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues who reports to the Secretary. This position embodies our commitment to and advocacy for gender equality as an essential part of diplomacy and development and signals our understanding that this is important to the national security of the United States. In addition, the office advances a coherent and coordinated strategy on gender throughout the State Department and USAID. [DONE] Ensure that gender is effectively addressed throughout all bureaus and missions. We recommend the following structural changes at State. First, make the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary (PDAS) in all regional and functional bureaus responsible and accountable for their bureaus' work on gender. The Office of Global Women's Issues would serve as a resource to the PDAS on these issues. Second, assign specialized gender liaisons to regional bureaus for purposes of integration, where needed. Third, include training and capacity development for employees on gender Issues (in both Foreign and Civil Service as well as for political appointees). Fourth, evaluate the PDAS in each bureau on gender integration in policies and programs (including, for example, as a component in the Performance Evaluation System). Similarly, require each Chief of Mission to be responsible and accountable for the mission's work on gender, to assign personnel with expertise to manage the work on gender, to require personnel to receive training on gender issues, and to be evaluated on this work. A parallel structure should be put in place at USAID, and our diplomacy and development work on gender should be coordinated and complimentary. [THIS IS RECOMMENDATION, WITH SOME VARIATION, MADE FOR MANY AREAS — PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, MULTILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND OTHERS — CHALLENGE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY HOW TO ADDRESS EFFECTIVELY AND CREAT A PDAS JOB THAT IS MEANINGFUL GIVEN THE NEW RESPONSIBILITIES SOUGHT TO BE IMPOSED THROUGH THAT POSITION] Include gender in strategic planning and budget allocation. We recommend continuing the requirement initiated last year that all bureaus include a plan for gender integration in their annual Strategic Plan and Budget proposal. Each bureau is required to describe how their policies and programs will improve gender equality and how that will strengthen their work more generally. They are also required, to the extent possible, to outline what portion of their policies and programs target or affect women and girls. [THIS ALREADY IS IN PLACE AND WOULD BE RETAINED] Measure impact. Develop indicators and long-term evaluation systems to measure the impact of programs on women and girls. There are efforts underway currently within F and at USAID to consider how to improve our measurement of impact on women and girls and to develop different and additional indicators where appropriate. [SAME AS IMMEDIATELY ABOVE —THIS IS ALREADY IN PROCESS] Happy to discuss. cdm

We haven't gotten that idea fleshed out yet, but it would be worth at least raising for later follow-up. AM

C05765718	November 12, 2009 - Dems Fade In Ohio Senate Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Obama Gets Negative Score In Key Swing State Word format For the first time, Republican Rob Portman is inching ahead of the two Democrats in the 2010 race for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. Also for the first time, Ohio voters disapprove 50 - 45 percent of the job President Barack Obama is doing, down from his 53 - 42 percent approval September 16 and 49 - 44 percent approval July 7. In still another first, voters are split 40 - 40 percent on who is doing a better job handling health care, the President or Congressional Republicans, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh- pe-ack) University survey finds. In a September 16 survey on the same question, Obama was on top 49 - 28 percent. Ohio voters disapprove 53 - 42 percent of the way the President is handling the economy and disapprove 57 - 36 percent of the way he is handling health care. In September, they approved of his handling of the economy 48 - 46 percent and split on his handling of health care 44 - 45 percent. \The Democratic wave that swept through Ohio in 2006 and 2008 may be cresting. The Democratic lead in the Governors and Senate races has evaporated and for the first time President Barack Obama is under water in the most important swing state in the country,\ said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \Ohio voters are not happy with the Presidents handling of health care and the economy. The fact that they now are split whether he or the Republicans in Congress are better able to handle health care should be a very worrisome number at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. since the GOP is still pretty much a four-letter word in most of America.\ Independent voters, often the group that decides Ohio elections, disapprove 49 - 45 percent of the overall job Obama is doing and disapprove 54 - 39 percent of his handling of the economy. They disapprove 62 - 34 percent, almost 2-1, of his handling of health care. \In July, when the Presidents job approval began falling nationally from the high 50s and low 60s into the low 50s, Ohio was the first place it showed up in the polls,\ said Brown. Portman, a former Congressman running for the U.S. Senate in 2010, has small leads over two Democrats, topping Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 38 - 34 percent and Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher 39 - 36 percent. In the battle for the Democratic Senate nomination, Fisher gets 24 percent to Brunners 22 percent, with 51 percent undecided. Portman leads car dealer Tom Ganley 26 - 7 percent in a GOP primary with 64 percent undecided. \None of the Senate candidates are very well known, but what is significant is that until now Democrats were winning all the Senate matchups. Clearly there is an at least temporary swing toward the GOP in Ohio. Whether it continues is anyone's guess,\ said Brown. Ohio voters oppose Obamas health care plan 55 - 36 percent, with independents against it 57 - 33 percent. By a 61 - 35 percent margin, voters dont think Congress should approve a health care overhaul if it only gets Democratic votes. But Ohio voters support 53 - 40 percent giving people the option of a government health insurance plan. Independent voters support this public option 55 - 38 percent. Afghanistan The United States is doing the right thing fighting in Afghanistan, Ohio voters say 48 - 43 percent. Voters support 51 - 40 percent the recommendations of the top U.S. commanders in Afghanistan that 40,000 more U.S. troops should be sent. \But 55 percent of Ohioans say they are only willing to see large numbers of American troops in Afghanistan for two years or less, which is hardly a mandate for the type of long-term commitment that the Pentagon has said will be needed for victory,\ said Brown. From November 5 - 9, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,123 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.9 percentage points. The survey includes 406 Republicans and 394 Democrats, each with a margin of error of +/- 4.9 percentage points. The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for research. For more data or RSS feed- http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling.xml, call (203) 582-5201, or follow us on Twitter. Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-CT) is still in serious trouble in his re-election race with 53% of voters saying he does not deserve re-election, a new Quinnipiac poll finds. Connecticut voters disapprove, 54% to 40%, of the job Dodd is doing, compared to a 49% to 43% disapproval in September. In general election match ups, Dodd loses to both Rob Simmons (R), 49% to 38%, and to Linda McMahon (R), 43% to 41%.

C05770294	sbwhoeop Monday, May 10, 2010 4:52 PM H H: All still in play, by end of Monday. Sid Gordon was convinced he had to sacrifice himself for any attempt to form a grand progressive coalition with the Lib-Dems. Clegg had said during the campaign he would not deal with Gordon and he remained adamant. Peter, Alastair, Ed Balls, and Ed Miliband met secretly with the LD team on Sunday. Gordon decided to fall on his sword today. The negotiations between Labour and the LDs now are engaged with the same teams. The Tories at the same time also are negotiating. Both offer competing plans for electoral reform that would give the LDs more representation in the future. If the LDs strike a deal with the Tories Labour is unlikely to support it and campaign against that referendum. Cameron is strained right now. His right does not approve of a deal while others push him to make an arrangement in order to attain power. Cameron may be limited in how far he can go in his offer. But by no means is a Labour-LD deal certain or even probable, even given Gordon's political suicide. The campaign for leader to replace Gordon begins as soon as the Labour-LD negotiations are concluded. David is ready to go; he will face Ed Balls and possibly his brother Ed. If there is a coalition that would tilt against Balls, who is seen as Gordon's heir and as an inappropriate PM, Gordon redux, to work with the LDs. One of the Milibands will emerge. I still bet on David. So four days after the election, everything is still in play. Sid

C05768675	Below is the article I mentioned: U.S. Revises Tack on Mideast Arms Washington, Egypt Discuss Plan to Rid Region of Nuclear Weapons, in Effort to Steal Iran's Thunder at U.N. Conference By JONATHAN WEISMAN, JAY SOLOMON and JOE LAURIA The U.S. is negotiating with Egypt a proposal to make the Middle East a region free of nuclear weapons, as the U.S. seeks to prevent Iran from derailing a monthlong U.N. conference on nuclear nonproliferation that begins Monday. U.S. officials familiar with the move call it an important step in assuring countries that Washington—criticized by some for its silence about Israel's undeclared nuclear arsenal—will equitably address weapons proliferation across the region, as Iran seeks to shift focus away from its own nuclear program. Washington also reassured Israel it won't foist a nuclear-free zone on the region until all parties agree to it and significant progress has been made on Mideast peace. The U.N. conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is held every five years, is expected to begin with a bang Monday with an address by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has condemned the West for its refusal to disarm and for tacitly accepting Israel's nuclear capability. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will follow the Iranian leader in the afternoon. The U.N. talks come at a time when Iran is believed to be heading toward a nuclear capability and the U.S. and allies have been pressing for new, tough Security Council sanctions to curb Tehran's program. \The Iranians are clearly intending to spoil the party,\ said a senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. The official highlighted the importance of raising Mideast nuclear-free zone issues. The designation of the region as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction was a nonbinding agreement that emerged from a 1995 U.N. review of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a 1970 pact to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. That 1995 agreement was pivotal because it won the indefinite extension of the treaty, but no action on the zone has been taken since. Senior Obama administration officials said Friday the White House is willing to significantly advance a Mideast nuclear weapons-free zone, and would support a conference on the subject at a future date. U.S. officials said talks with Egypt would resume in New York in the coming month. Such a zone is envisaged to include Israel, the Arab states, Iran and Turkey. \Weve made a proposal to them [Egypt] that goes beyond what the U.S. has been willing to do before,\ said the senior U.S. official involved in the nuclear diplomacy. U.S. officials stressed, however, that they didnt believe that would happen without first achieving major advances in Arab-Israeli peace talks. \We are concerned that the conditions are not right unless all members of the region participate, which would be unlikely unless there is a comprehensive peace plan which is accepted,\ said Ellen Tauscher, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security. She said the U.S. has also discussed the zone with the Arab League and other members of the Nonaligned Movement. The diplomacy could raise new tensions between President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if Washington is seen backing away from its commitment to Israel. Israel has voiced concerns that the U.N. conference could turn into an international forum to corner Israel. Mr. Netanyahu backed out of a nuclear-security conference in Washington in March due to such concerns. An Israeli official said Friday that his government supports a Middle East freeze of WMD and nuclear weapons, but that \it should be the culmination of a process that begins with bilateral and individual peace agreements between all the countries in the region.\ The U.S. and Israel have been locked in a monthslong spat over Mr. Obamas calls for a complete freeze in building new Jewish housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. officials have grown increasingly confident in recent days that ties between the U.S. and Israel have stabilized. Mrs. Clinton said Friday that the Mideast peace process will get on track next week, though not the U.S.-brokered direct talks involving Israeli and Palestinians that the Obama administration wants to see. Egypts latest proposal calls for Israels disarmament \as soon as possible.\ It also called for Israels nuclear program to be placed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.s atomic watchdog. That proposal wont be accepted, U.S. officials said. The Egyptian working paper demands NPT signatory states release \all information available to them on the nature and scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to Israel.\ U.S. officials indicated no such demands could be made on Israel. Arms-control analysts familiar with the talks say the U.S. is likely to propose creating a U.N. envoy given the task of calling a conference of Middle East nations to press forward on the nuclear weapon-free zone. \They are desperate to buy off Egyptian objections,\ said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Non-Proliferation Education Center and a critic of the Obama administrations arms-control approach. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, an advocacy group, said the U.S. acceptance of a special envoy is a significant shift. A U.S. official refused to say whether the envoy proposal, first floated by Russia, was part of the U.S. offer. The last NPT conference in 2005 ended in collapse. But U.S. officials said they have been laying the groundwork for this conference for nearly a year. The White House wants rules to ensure that a country that withdraws from the treaty doesnt escape inspections and sanctions. They also want more power for U.N. inspectors and more backing for multinational facilities that could help nations develop peaceful nuclear power.

C05739811	AP - Rice defends Benghazi remarks By: Associated Press November 21, 2012 07:03 PM EST U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Wednesday her early account of the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in Benghazi was based on the initial intelligence community assessments and was always subject to review and updates. She said she respected Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has been critical of her, but said \some of the statements he's made about me have been unfounded, but I look forward to having the opportunity at the appropriate time to discuss all of this with him.\ Her comments attributed the attacks to a mob enraged over an anti-Muslim video posted on YouTube were widely denounced by Republicans during the U.S. presidential campaign. The attack came an the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States, and her critics said it was clearly a terrorist attack timed to take place on the anniversary. The focus has fallen on her because she is a longtime White House insider and is believed to be President Barack Obamas first choice to replace Secrretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not expected to stay on during his second term. Rice told reporters outside the U.N. Security Council: \As a senior U.S. diplomat, I agreed to a White House request to appear on the Sunday shows to talk about the full range of national security issues of the day, which at that time were primarily and particularly the protests that were enveloping and threatening many diplomatic facilities, American diplomatic facilities around the world, and Irans nuclear program.\ Hours before the Benghazi violence, a mob in Cairo attacked the U.S. Embassy there to denounce the videos as anti- Islamic blasphemy. Killed in the Benghazi violence were Ambassador Chris Stevens, foreign service officer Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. Rice said, \The attack on our facilities in Benghazi was obviously a significant piece of this\ pattern. \When discussing he attack against our facilities in Benghazi, I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to me by the intelligence community,\ she said. \I made clear that the information was preliminary, and that our investigations would give us the definitive answers,\ she added.

C05770467	http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/opinion/16iht-edcohen.html?2=1&emc=eta18,pagewanted=print July 15, 2010 Inners arid Losers Ey ROGER COHEN NEW YORK — The Clintons threw a big Washington bash on June 30 for Hillary Clinton's longtime aide, Hume Abedin, and what struck one of the many guests was the absence of anyone from President Obama's tight White House inner circle. Congressional heavyweights thronged the garden of the Clinton spread on Embassy Row, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The city's big powerbrokers and various State Department honchos were there for a party marking Abedin's marriage to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York. But White House insiders stayed away. Well, as Bill Clinton told CNN recently, \I did everything I could to defeat President Obama and I wanted Hillary to win\ — old wounds do not heal overnight. Indeed, they may not heal at all. When my informant said something about the old grievances not going away, the response from the hosts went something like this: No, they don't and they never will. But, we're public servants and suckers for punishment, so we soldier on. Speaking of soldiering on, Mrs. Clinton left for Europe the next day and while Americans celebrated July 4, she was in Armenia trying to sort out the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and.— equally thankless task — mediate between Armenia and Turkey on their disagreement over what happened in 1915. You've got to salute Hillary. She's got guts to go with that razor-sharp mind. It's a heck of a job being secretary of state when the White House puts a tight collar around the big issues — Afghanistan, Iran, Israel-Palestine and Iraq — and you're left with Nagorno-Karabakh, disputed Ottoman crimes of World War I and, if you're lucky, U.S. bases on Okinawa. The situation might be slightly less troubling if the boys in the White House — and they are overwhelmingly boys — were foreign-policy heavyweights. They're not. Indeed, I'm told Henry Kissinger refers to them as \the kids.\ Chief among them, according to my colleague Helene Cooper, is Denis McDonough, the National Security Council's chief of staff. Earlier this month, Cooper wrote: \Forget Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton or Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. When it comes to national security, Mr. Obamas inner circle is so tight it largely consists of Mr. McDonough, a 40-year-old from Minnesota who is unknown to most Americans.\ I do know McDonough and Ive spent a fair amount of time in Minnesota. He has many of the states qualities: positive, brisk, can-do, affable and efficient. But am I reassured when! read that Obamas national-security inner circle is comprised of him? Nope. He was a great guy to control the foreign-policy side of a campaign — as he did to perfection for Obama — but hes not a great guy to think big about the world. Thinking big and bold is required right now. The clock is ticking on momentous presidential decisions. Among them are an Afghan extrication that will salvage a minimum of core U.S. security interests — which will require a bruising negotiation with the Taliban — and what to do about Iran when it becomes apparent by the end of this year that the latest sanctions have changed nothing. Obamas apparent carte blanche to Israel this month on Iran was disturbing. Then theres Israel-Palestine, where Obama cant decide whether the cost of being an honest broker pressure on both sides — is worth the domestic heat he takes for being critical of Israel, with the result that hes zigzagging to little effect. After firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Obama said he would tolerate debate but not division. My sense is his foreign- policy house is divided — and the weaker for it. Gen. James Jones, his national security adviser, speaks fine French — the French love that — but hes left most people unconvinced. Tom Donilon, Jones deputy, dances around the vacuum as best he can. Like McDonough, David Axelrod and Rehm Emanuel were brilliant campaign strategists, but should they be foreign-policy strategists? In Clinton, Obama has a Baker-class secretary of state. For how much longer is he going to delegate her to Nagorno- Karabakh? The State Department, a repository of Other underused talent, cannot be the White House annex for non- critical affairs. Back in the 1860s, James Gordon Bennett, then the editor of the New York Herald, a forebear of the International Herald Tribune, gave these instructions to an intrepid foreign correspondent named Henry Morton Stanley: \Draw a thousand pounds now; and when you have gone through that, draw another thousand, and when that is spent, draw another thousand, and when you have finished that, draw another thousand, and so on; but, FIND LIVINGSTONE.\ He was referring to the lost African explorer, David Livingstone, whom Stanley eventually tracked down on Lake Tanganyika, uttering the immortal words: \Doctor Livingstone, I presume?\ That sort of journalisms gone out of fashion. So we can all thank Rolling Stone for opening its pocketbook and telling Michael Hastings to do whatever it took to find General McChrystal. In his brilliant piece, Hastings did that. He also found something else: an Afghan policy as fragmented as the team Obama running it. McChrystals gone, but not the dysfunction. A blow-up, I presume? Watch this space.

Since then, much progress has been made there. He became head of the new Ukrainian Catholic University and has really come in to his own as a respected leader and scholar. Unfortunately, his situation and that of the Catholic community and academic freedom has come under siege since Yanokovich became president. I have a series of emails from the US Ukrainian community, in addition to this email directly from Gudziak, They are alarmed about developments.

Theyre calling it the \Jimmy Carter Strategy\: Exploit Libya attack to paint Obama as weak on terrorism By cYaia?,_ (Credit: AP/AI Behrman/Salort) According to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the first presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new two-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part, on inW !ia:en,y-.3iTeForrnation regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens on September The source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney tamp that took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to their new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise. He added that they planned to release what they hoped would be \a bombshell\ that would make Libya and Obamas foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. \My understanding is that they have come up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going to be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.\ The source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration \definitely had intel\ about the attack before it happened. \Intelligence can be graded in different ways,\ he added, \and sometimes A and B dont get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to paint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\ He said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a helpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter's failed attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in t980. \They are so excited about it,\ he said. \Over and over again they talked about bow it would be just like Jimmy Carters failed raid. They feel it is going to give them .a last-minute landslide in the election.\ The source, however, said lie was dubious about the tactic. \To me, it is indicative that they have lost touch with a huge portion of the electorate,\ he said. The source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present. But he said, \These were the top guys in the party. It was a .private, unguarded planning conversation.\ He further U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739615 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER. described participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican super PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence. \As usual, Karl Rove wasnt present,\ he said, \but some were close to Rove.\ The source said that \there was quite a bit more\ to the operation than simply revealing the intelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the operation. However, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday, September 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama's reaction to what happened in Libya \inexplicable\ and added that Obama is \more intent on campaigning than meeting his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.\ He went on to warn that Obama's policies in Libya endangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \I am astonished,\ Rove said. \We are projecting weakness when we need to be projecting strength.\ Similarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who became known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history,\ he told Fox News. \And its the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four Americans.\ Giuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it seemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \I think its because they have this narrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\ he said. \They never say the words Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia — he was going to declare this a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very convenient narrative.\ Likewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration's response to \the terrorist attack\ in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \I think they want to do their very best to keep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect transparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\ Romney said. Added Ryan, \Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are saying that this is a terrorist attack? Well leave it up to you to decide whether its a cover-up or not.\ In an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were divided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One unnamed Romney adviser described them as \a huge gift\ to the campaign. \Across the board — domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues — President Obama has been outmatched by events,\ he said. \Hes an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, hes been outmatched.\ But other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as the central issue. \Theyll tell you that youve got to focus people on the fact that their economic prospects are not very good and all that,\ the aide told Politico. \Well, Romneys been trying to do that now since he clinched the nomination at the end of April — and hes failed. The president is better at deflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on individual voters.\ Craig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \House of Bush, House of Saud,\ and a frequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC's Today Show and other broadcast outlets.

November 2010 Declaring America's Stand on Middle East Peace By Chester A. Crocker, Scott B. Lasensky and Samuel W. Lewis Faltering Middle East peace talks need a jolt. Washington has a powerful option for moving the process forward: taking a firm stand on how to end the conflict. An American declaration of principles—carefully crafted and properly marketed--could spark a debate and thereby change the political calculus for leaders. As a mediator and a world power, one of America's strongest assets is the ability to legitimize ideas and then rally others in support. A central role for the U.S. in this conflict must be to define the zone of negotiability. This does not mean imposing peace. Rather, it would be a statement of the basic principles the U.S. believes can guide the parties toward a negotiated solution. America has long declared its support for \two states,\ but must now say more about what that means in practice. Even if the current talks resume, without American ideas the parties are unlikely to agree on the broad trade-offs necessary to reach a peace deal. A quick deal on \borders and security,\ as many have proposed, is itself unlikely without Washington addressing the end-game. Otherwise, both sides would be too exposed on issues set for later discussion, like Jerusalem and refugees. Opinion polling has consistently showed that support for peace is strongest when all the core issues are addressed. An American statement of principles would mobilize regional support. It would provide, for the first time, a public framework for engaging sponsors of the Arab Peace Initiative. It would also strengthen our ability to reassert the importance of a regional support structure for the bilateral negotiations, especially by reviving multilateral contacts and meetings involving Israelis and their neighbors from throughout the region. Moreover, greater regional engagement on the peace process can carry powerful benefits for regional challenges like the Iranian nuclear program. A clearer U.S. declaration is also the surest way to protect prospects for a two-state solution from an unrelenting onslaught on the ground that pushes the parties away from a peace deal. An American set of ideas would anchor present-day demands on issues like Jerusalem, security and settlements in a clear vision of the future. Perhaps most urgently, it would broaden the debate from the narrow confines of the settlements question. At a minimum, the American declaration should be based on the 1967 lines, with agreed territorial swaps; support a compromise on Jerusalem that allows for two capitals for two states; include provisions about security limitations and guarantees; reiterate America's support for an agreed solution to the refugee problem; and reaffirm our long-standing commitment to the State of Israel. But American principles should also include some caveat, given that our ultimate interest is in an agreed, viable solution—not in any particular formula. What would it take for American ideas to succeed? Unlike some past efforts, Washington should not try to 'pre-cook' this declaration with one or more parties or to choreograph their reactions. In fact, the U.S. statement of principles would be explicitly described as what our own country believes in and can support; and by implication cannot support. Thus, the U.S. statement would not be designed to achieve immediate approval or adoption by the parties. Its purpose would be to clarify where America stands, how we define our interests and what we can work for. It would aim at influencing the climate of thinking in the region, sobering up those with illusions and encouraging those who need our support. Timing and context are of course key considerations. Assuming the current gridlock in negotiations persists, some time must elapse until our election results have been digested, here and abroad, and before public attention can be redirected toward the foreboding and increasingly dangerous Arab-Israel stalemate. A presidential speech will then be essential to dramatize the seriousness of our purpose and to lay out the principles. It should be immediately followed by a major, high level diplomatic effort to persuade key Middle East leaders and our Quartet and UN allies of our genuine desire to regionalize the peacemaking effort. To maximize support from key members of Congress, the speech should occur before Congress adjourns. No further consultation with the stalemated parties beyond the routine should precede the speech, and leaks of its contents must be kept to an absolute minimum if our purpose is not to be undermined. The speech could usefully also remove some of the veil of silence that shrouds breakthroughs in past negotiations; for example, progress in the Annapolis process. As for the substance, in its endorsement of a two-state solution and comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, the Obama Administration has hinted that a Palestinian settlement should also accompany normalized relations between Israel and the Arab states, putting a broader framing around what has traditionally been defined as a conflict between Israel and its immediate neighbors. The normalization piece of the puzzle should be more fully articulated as part of a new strategy based on presenting American ideas to the parties. It is a way to entice skeptical Israelis, but it also leads back to a long overdue need for Washington to engage on the Arab Peace Initiative. If the U.S. puts forward its own peace principles, American leadership can ensure that any diplomatic process is defined by as clear a picture as possible of what the parties can expect to gain through a negotiated settlement, and of what they will never gain without one. Skeptics say it is too risky to present American ideas to the parties, that it would pull the rug out from under current leaders, exposing them to withering domestic criticism. Others argue that it will galvanize obstructionists, not those who support compromise, and could very well precipitate a crisis on the ground. Others simply worry about the cost to American prestige should any of the key players react negatively. But the risks are overstated, and a complete collapse of the process would be far more dangerous, particularly as the strategic environment shifts in favor of regional forces that seek to undermine, rather than promote peace. America can and must do more than limit itself to managing a conflict that has all too often upended our shared interests in peace and stability. END Chester A.

C05765834	Here is rasmussen statement at press conf today: On behalf of NATO, I warmly welcome President Obama's announcement on the new US approach and commitment to the mission in Afghanistan. President Obama's decision to substantially increase the numbers of US forces in the NATO- led operation is proof of his resolve; the overall approach he laid out is a broader political strategy for success. The United States' contribution to the NATO-led mission has always been substantial; it is now even more important.But this is not a US mission alone: America's Allies in NATO have shared the risks, costs and burdens of this mission from the beginning. As the US increases its commitment, I am confident that the other Allies, as well as our Partners in the mission, will also make a substantial increase in their contribution. Taken together, the new force contributions from across the Alliance, as well as the new approach agreed by all the ISAF countries, will help create a new momentum in the mission in 2010.

I can tell you this morning the Secretary departed Washington and she stopped at the North Pole for an important bilateral meeting with a well known international figure. During the meeting, in a formal demarche, sung to the tune of Twelve Days of Christmas, the Secretary outlined her aspirations for the new year. They include, and feel free to hum along: open and accountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment of women, fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the United States Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation, and lastly, a championship for the Boston Red Sox. Okay, that last ones not on her list, but Harold Koh and I thought it was important that we mention that here.\ It is a privilege to be a part of your team.

Here it is again which might allay your concerns SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, David, I think that the President has ordered the departments that deal with this — Homeland Security, Interior, Environmental Protection, Defense — to all immediately not only do everything possible to mitigate the effects of this spill, but to try to come up with recommendations going forward. The first order of business, however, is to try to get this spill under control, which has been, as you know, very difficult, and to prevent further damage to the coastline along Louisiana to the fishing waters, to the wildlife. I think it does raise questions which the President has said have to be answered. He put forth a very comprehensive approach that included the potential of drilling off of our own shores. That is a national security concern because we have to do better to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. But it has to be done safely. It cant be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills. So as with so much in these difficult areas, its going to require a balancing act.

C05776365	H: Les Gelb, who oversaw the writing of the Pentagon Papers, makes the points that Wikileaks show US today trying to solve difficult international problems, telling the truth and diplomats acting professionally. Wiki Leaks Accidentally Helps U.S. by Leslie H. Gelb November 30, 2010 I 10:42pm Julian Assange clearly intended the State Dept. cable leaks to smear the U.S. as evil and selfish. Leslie H. Gelb on how he inadvertently proved the opposite. The Wikileakers dumped a vast pile of secrets to prove that the United States was selfish, stupid and wicked—but their revelations proved just the opposite. When you remove the gossip and obvious trivia that mesmerized the press, you clearly see what the Wikileakers never expected: A United States seriously and professionally trying to solve the most dangerous problems in a frighteningly complicated world, yet lacking the power to dictate solutions. U.S. policymakers and diplomats are shown, quite accurately, doing what they are supposed to do: ferreting out critical information from foreign leaders, searching for paths to common action, and struggling with the right amount of pressure to apply on allies and adversaries. And in most cases, the villain is not Washington, but foreign leaders escaping common action with cowardice and hypocrisy. Dont think for a New York minute that Julian Assange, the Wikileaker, unloaded this trove to save humankind. Why did he toss in those cables about Italys leader being a rake and Germanys chancellor being a cautious fuddy-duddy, and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan being \paranoid\? To save the world? Not a chance. He did it to get attention, and he got attention from a drooling press, which then went on to call the very material they were highlighting trivial. Did Assange leak critical conversations with Chinese or Arab leaders to help solve the problems in Korea and Iran? Not by the hair on your chinny chin chin. He did it to show that he could do it—and for the attention. Anyone who is not a hopeless left-wing ideologue knows that such leaks will crush future serious conversations with those leaders for some time to come. Just think: if you told someone a serious and critical confidence about someone else, and your confidant went out and told others, would you soon repeat that mistake? Assange did not leak these cables to help solve world problems. These leaks were absolutely gratuitous and served only the purpose of making him a media marvel. When you actually read the cables, heres what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world In explaining his deed publicly, Assange suggests that what hes doing is uncovering American misdeeds and lies. His aim, he says, is to inform citizens of democracies and peoples around the world about what their leaders are really doing. Assange also insists he did this for transparencys sake. Yet when he got to look inside, he didnt see what was plain: that our diplomats were doing a good job. Indeed, when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, heres what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems. But when you turn off his nonsense and stop listening to the strange commentary on cable news and even on the front pages of great newspapers, when you actually read the cables, heres what you see: American leaders and American diplomats trying to solve crucial world problems. —Washington needs Chinas help in bolstering sanctions against Iran, and China balks for fear of jeopardizing its oil and gas flow from that country. The Obama team arranges for Saudi Arabia to guarantee any loss in supply to China. If the world wants to slow or even prevent Irans march to nuclear weaponry, this is a key path to doing so. — The U.S. discovers that North Korea has manufactured new medium-range missiles and is trying to deliver them to Iran through China. The Obama team discovers this, informs Beijing, and asks Beijing to stop the transfer. Beijing declines. Really creepy. — Yemens leader takes public responsibility for American missile attacks against Al Qaeda in Yemen. He wants to diminish the power of these terrorists, as do Americans and most others in the world. The \lie\ by the Yemeni president is a harmless way to get a critical job done—that is, the job of fighting international terrorism. Wikileaks tears away the political cover of Yemens leaders. —No country has anywhere near as much influence over nutty North Korea as China. So, U.S. diplomats are searching desperately to figure out Chinese thinking about North Korea in order to compose a plan for avoiding war on the Korean Peninsula. So, the Wikileakers expose some Chinese leaders who are actually trying to give us some insight into Chinese thinking about North Korean craziness. They wont do that again soon. Time and again, as one actually reads these cables, one has to be heartened by the professionalism and the insights of U.S. diplomats. What are they doing? They are not lying, and U.S. leaders are not lying. They are actually, believe it or not, trying to solve problems. That seriousness of purpose and the professionalism to execute it is what jumps out at you in these materials. So, the naïve say, its good to show the effectiveness of our diplomats. Give me a break. Ask any American diplomat to choose between looking intelligent in leaked cables and making progress toward avoiding war. None of this is to say that there should not be leaks, or that the press should not pursue classified information that is necessary or very helpful to a sensible public debate on policy. If a U.S. administration is lying, or distorting the facts, or telling one story to the public and another to itself, then by all means, lets have it out in public. If the U.S. government is concocting intelligence in order to justify wars, lets hope an enterprising reporter finds it out for the rest of us. But the Wikileaks dump is not about providing essential information to Americans or to others—information they need for serious policy discussion. This massive trashing by Wikileaks of a legitimate effort by the U.S. government to preserve confidentiality is the very least a shame and at the most, a crime. Leslie H.

C05767801	http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2010/01/11/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry6084818.shtml?tag=stack January 11, 2010 6:30 PM Obamas Approval Rating Dips to New Low (CBS) President Obamas job approval rating has fallen to 46 percent, according to a new CBS News poll. That rating is Mr. Obamas lowest yet in CBS News polling, and the poll marks the first time his approval rating has fallen below the 50 percent mark. Forty-one percent now say they disapprove of Mr. Obamas performance as president. In last months CBS News poll, 50 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling his job, while thirty- nine percent disapproved. Analysis: The Irony Behind Obamas Poll Numbers Mr. Obama still receives strong support from Democrats (eight in ten approve of his performance), but his approval rating among Republicans is only 13 percent. More importantly, Mr. Obamas approval rating among independents has declined 10 points in recent months — and it now stands at just 42 percent. Domestic issues — and not his response to terrorist threats - appear to be driving the presidents approval rating downward. Just 41 percent now approve of his handling of the economy, which Americans say is the nations most pressing issue. Forty-seven percent disapprove. The presidents marks on handling health care, with reforms still under debate in Congress, are even lower — just 36 percent approve, while 54 percent disapprove. Both of these approval ratings are the lowest of Mr. Obamas presidency. Meanwhile, both parties in Congress receive even lower marks than the president on handling health care. Few Americans think the reforms in Congress hit the right note on expanding coverage, lowering costs and regulating the health insurance industry. (Read more on the health care poll results) (CBS) The president receives slightly higher ratings for his handling of the war in Afghanistan and the threat of terrorism than on domestic issues. Forty-six percent approve of Mr. Obamas handling of Afghanistan, and 52 percent approve of how he is handling the threat of terrorism. While some Republicans have criticized the president and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitanos responses to the attempted Christmas Day terror attack, most Americans dont share their opinion. In the poll, 57 percent of Americans approve of the way the Obama administration has responded to the attempted attack, and 29 percent disapprove. Views are highly partisan — 75 percent of Democrats approve, while just 41 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of independents do. More Findings from the Poll: •Fear of another terrorist attack has increased since the attempted attack on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam on Christmas Day. Now, 26 percent think another attack on the United States within the next few months is very likely, up from 12 percent just before the latest incident. This is the highest percentage that has felt an attack was very likely since March 2003, just after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. •While most Americans (56 percent) have at least a fair amount of confidence that the government will protect its citizens from future attacks, just 15 percent are very confident. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, more expressed confidence. •Few Americans —just 19 percent - think U.S. intelligence agencies are doing all they could to monitor the actions of suspected terrorists. Seventy-six think they could be doing more. •Most Americans support conducting full body scans on travelers using a digital x-ray machine, a device some airports are now using. Seventy-four percent agree these machines should be used because they provide a detailed check for hidden weapons and explosives and reduce the need for physical searches. Just 20 percent think these machines should not be used because they would produce an image of a passengers naked body and are an invasion of privacy. •Over half of Americans think the U.S. should continue to keep the Guantanamo Bay prison open. Thirty-two percent think it ought to be closed and the prisoners there transferred somewhere else. •The American public continues to volunteer the economy and jobs as the most important problem facing the country (44 percent), with health care a distant second (14 percent). In the wake of the attempted terror attack on Christmas Day, the percentage that cites terrorism as the most pressing issue has risen to seven percent from zero percent early last month. •The publics overall assessment of the condition of the national economy remains grim — 82 percent of Americans say the economy is in bad shape. Looking ahead, 31 percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, while 19 percent think it is getting worse. Forty-nine percent now say the economy is staying the same.

C05765000	Counseling That Helps the Dying Live By Devin Talbott and Strobe Talbott Saturday, August 29, 2009 Many opponents of health-care reform have concentrated their fire on a provision in House legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer end-of-life counseling. How our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial. Unfortunately, the debate has degenerated into a cacophony of demagoguery and distortion, including invocations of Hitler and fear-mongering about \death panels.\ As a result of these attacks, a number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from Congress have abandoned support for end-of-life counseling. Our familys experience this year provided a vivid perspective on the value of that service and the misguidedness of the campaign against it. Brooke Shearer -- wife, mother and grandmother -- had been fighting cancer for more than a year. She had undergone major surgery, numerous scans and biopsies, and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy. Her doctors were among the best in their fields. Their expertise did not, however, extend to the fine points of, and latest advances in, pain management. Brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her family for whatever time we had together. With that goal in mind, she sought advice and treatment from palliative-care specialists at Washington Home and Community Hospices. Their ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her final months. Working closely with her primary physicians, the hospice staff helped Brooke anticipate the likely course of her disease in a way that allowed her to make decisions and exercise a degree of control over both her own condition and our familys adjustment to it. When her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working, Brooke put herself fully into the hands of Washington Home as an outpatient. Regular house calls by hospice doctors, nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects, spend time with friends and family, and end her life at home, which was a considerable comfort to her and to us. These, not issues of cost, were the principal considerations for our family. However, controlling the cost of health care -- especially in the last year of life -- is an important part of the current national debate. Therefore it is worth noting that Brookes treatment in the last stages of her illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year. It has often been said that dying can be a full-time job. That was emphatically not the case with Brooke. Until her final days, she concentrated on living -- a choice that end-of-life counseling helped make possible. Hospice care more than meets the standard of the Hippocratic oath: It not only does no harm -- it does good; it is not about hastening death but enhancing life. If counseling about hospice services and palliative care is a beneficiary of health care reform, many Americans will be as well.

C05772699	http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/08/goodbye_mr_ jones Goodbye, Mr. Jones And good riddance. Why Jim Jones was the worst national security advisor in decades. BY DAVID J. ROTHKOPF I OCTOBER 8, 2010 The presidents inexperience did in Jones more than any of the generals deficits. He didnt know what he wanted. He vacillated on key issues. He simply demonstrated the problems America repeatedly has when it hires men with no foreign- policy background to take on the most important international job in the world. Further, he did not really know enough about how the presidency works to nip in the bud the creation of the inner-circle bubble that effectively negated much of the work that the formal policy process did. Obama encouraged (or tolerated for long-enough that it looks like encouragement) his campaign foreign-policy deputies to continue to report directly to him, and this led to some public and private backdooring of Jones that undercut his authority dramatically. He did not empower Jones, and that combined with Joness own shortcomings led to the zero-chemistry, ineffective collaboration that has been openly criticized by senior White House and foreign policy officials since the spring of Obamas first year in office. In fact the situation got so bad that Jones was publicly undercut by true Obama confidante Denis McDonough more than once. It is something of a surprise he lasted this long. As one former national security advisor said to me while we were discussing a well-known instance of McDonough publicly undercutting Jones, \That would have only happened once on my watch. It would have been me or him.\

C05764896	Barack Obama rebuffs Gordon Brown as 'special relationship' sinks to new low Gordon Brown has been snubbed repeatedly by Barack Obama during his trip to the United States, as the fall-out from the release of the Lockerbie bomber appeared to have left \the special relationship\ at its lowest ebb for nearly 20 years. By Andrew Porter, Political Editor in New York Published: 11:49PM BST 23 Sep 2009 British officials made five attempts to secure official talks with the US President and even agreed to a policy change in an attempt to land a joint appearance between the two leaders, said diplomatic sources. But the White House rebuffed the offers and Mr Brown, who had hoped to increase his popularity by appearing on his own with Mr Obama, had to settle instead for a snatched conversation with the President in a New York kitchen. The setbacks led to fears that relati ons between Downing Street and the White House were at their lowest point since John Major's frosty dealings with Bill Clinton. It was disclosed earlier this week that Mr Brown would not hold bilateral talks with Mr Obama, despite the President hosting individual meetings with the leaders of Japan, China and Russia. Downing Street claimed that this was not unusual. However, a British diplomat told The Daily Telegraph that the White House's refusal to meet Mr Brown had been a serious embarrassment for the Prime Minister. \It is wrong for people to say that we have been relaxed about the way things have gone,\ the source said. \There were five attempts to set up a meeting and none have come off.\ The most striking example of Downing Street's desperation to engineer a meeting was a change of policy on supplying swine flu vaccines to Africa. It aimed to match America's commitment and was announced last week. As a result, it had been hoped that Mr Obama would agree to a joint press conference, according to a senior source. However, the meeting never happened. The White House said that Mr Brown and Mr Obama would chair a meeting tonight about Pakistan, and would \spend all day Friday together.\ However, Friday's meeting in Pittsburgh involves the full G20 group of world leaders. The release=2 Oof the Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, appears to have been behind the new chill in relations between Washington and London. Mr Obama expressed his dismay at the release in a telephone call with the Prime Minister earlier this month. Downing Street's original account of the conversation failed to refer to the President's anger. Mr Brown has maintained that freeing the Libyan was a matter entirely for the Scottish executive. Nearly 200 Americans died when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Scotland in 1988. Yesterday, families of victims protested at the UN in New York where Mr Brown and Libya's leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi, made speeches. Last night Downing Street played down suggestions of a rift with the White House and pointed to an informal discussion that Mr Brown had with Mr Obama after a climate change dinner at the UN on Tuesday night. The 15-minute \walk and chat\ took place in a kitchen of the UN headquarters as both men left the building in Manhattan. No 10 maintained that there was nothing unusual in the Prime Minister not holding a separate \bilateral\ meeting with the President. There was little doubt that Mr Brown would have relished a high profile meeting with Mr Obama. In a speech to the United Nations, Mr Obama said the world must \move in a new direction\ and \embrace20a new era of engagement\. That was seen as a sign that the President was more likely to place emphasis on relations with a wide range of countries rather than rely on old alliances. Mr Brown's increasingly poor relationship with the White House contrasts sharply with that of his predecessor Tony Blair, who enjoyed close friendships with both Mr Clinton and George W Bush. John Major's Tory government had difficulty with Mr Clinton, however, because of claims that Mr Major had tried to help George Bush Snr's re-election campaign in 1992 by allowing researchers to dig into Mr Clinton's student past at Oxford — something Sir John has always denied. Mr Brown, whose plans for a lunchtime speech to the United Nations were derailed after Col Gaddafi spoke for 96 minutes, faced attacks on several fronts yesterday. Kathy Tedeschi and Sue Kosmowski, Americans who lost husbands in the Lockerbie bombing, travelled to New York to protest outside the UN headquarters. They claimed that Mr Brown had put trade interests ahead of justice for victims families. The Prime Minister was also accused of trying to appease Iran by ignoring the supression of opposition in order to safeguard talks on its nuclear programme. Shirin Ebadi, Iran's only Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the West cared more about its own securit y than human rights. Mr Brown was criticised for failing to stay at a dinner where he was honoured as Statesman of the Year. Guests paid $1,000 to attend the function attended by, among others, Henry Kissinger and the pop star Bono.
C05762817	Yes. We had Jim raise this with the Greek ambassador yesterday, who told him that they were aware of the situation and would come back with a report when Jim got to Corfu.
C05762349	Just wanted to be sure you saw the Kurtzer op-ed, which ran Sunday in the Post. Kudos to Jonathan Prince for getting this written and placed. The Settlements Facts • By Daniel Kurtzer Sunday, June 14, 2009 Faulty analysis of the Israeli settlement issue is being passed off as fact. Charles Krauthanuner's June 5 column, \The Settlements Myth,\ is one example. Here are the facts: In 2003, the Israeli government accepted, with some reservations, the \road map\ for peace, which imposed two requirements on Israel regarding settlements: \GO! [Government of Israel] immediately dismantles settlement outposts erected since March 2001. Consistent with the Mitchell Report, GOI freezes all settlement activity (including natural growth of settlements).\ Today, Israel maintains that three events -- namely, draft understandings discussed in 2003 between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley; President George W. Bush's April 14, 2004, letter to Sharon; and an April 14 letter from Sharon adviser Dov Weissglas to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- constitute a formal understanding in which the United States accepted continuing Israeli building within the \construction line\ of settlements. The problem is that there was no such understanding. The first event the Israelis cite is the 2003 discussions on a four-part draft that included the notion that construction within settlements might be permitted if confined to the already built-up areas of the settlements. The idea was to draw a line around the outer perimeter of built-up areas in settlements and to allow building only inside that line. This draft was never codified, and no effort was made then to define the line around the built-up areas of settlements. Nonetheless, Israel began to act largely in accordance with its own reading of these provisions, probably believing that U.S. silence conferred assent. Second, President Bush's 2004 letter conveyed U.S. support of an agreed outcome of negotiations in which Israel would retain \existing major Israeli population centers\ in the West Bank \on the basis of mutually agreed changes. . . .\ One of the key provisions of this letter was that U.S. support for Israel's retaining some settlements was predicated on there being an \agreed outcome\ of negotiations. Despite Israel's contention that this letter allowed it to continue building in the large settlement blocs of Ariel, Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion, the letter did not convey any U.S. support for or understanding of Israeli settlement activities in these or other areas in the run-up to a peace agreement. In his 2004 letter to Rice, Weissglas addressed the issue of the \construction line,\ saying that \within the agreed principles of settlement activities, an effort will be made in the next few days to have a better definition of the construction line of settlements in Judea & Samaria.\ However, there never were any \agreed principles of settlement activities.\ Moreover, the effort to define the \construction line\ was never consummated: Israel and the United States discussed briefly but did not reach agreement on the definition of the construction line of settlements. Weissglas's letter also promised \continuous action\ to remove all the unauthorized outposts, but Israel removed almost none of them. Throughout this period, the Bush administration did not regularly protest Israel's continuing settlement activity. But this is very different from arguing that the United States agreed with it. In recent days, former senior Bush administration officials have told journalists on background that no understandings existed with Israel regarding continued settlement activity. Commentators also focus on the Obama administration's reiteration that a freeze must include the \natural growth\ of settlements. Krauthammer says that this \means strangling to death the thriving towns close to the 1949 armistice line. . . It means no increase in population. Which means no babies.\ This is nonsense. No one suggests that Israelis stop having babies. Rather, the blessing of a new baby does not translate into a right to build more apartments or houses in settlements. The two issues have nothing to do with each other. Israelis, like Americans, move all the time when life circumstances -- children, jobs, housing availability -- change. The pattern of population growth in the territories actually undercuts the natural-growth argument. Since 1993, when Israel signed the Oslo Accords, Israel's West Bank settler population has grown from 116,300 to 289,600. The numbers in East Jerusalem increased from 152,800 to more than 186,000. This goes far beyond the natural increase of families already living in the settlements. Inserting the provision of \natural growth\ in official documents started with the 2001 Mitchell Report and the 2003 \road map,\ reflecting recognition that the concept was being abused as a justification for expanding settlements. The Obama administration is pursuing policies that every administration since 1967 has articulated -- that settlements jeopardize the possibility of achieving peace and thus settlement activity should stop. This does not diminish the Palestinians' responsibilities, especially their commitment to stop violence and terrorism and uproot terrorist infrastructure. President Obama emphasized this in his Cairo speech. But Palestinian failures in no\ way justify Israeli failure to implement their road map commitments with respect to settlements and outposts. It is time for Israel to freeze all settlement activity and dismantle the unauthorized outposts.

C05768721	Youre very welcome. Weve got a pretty good process in place handling the projects, and as always, we have a great product to sell. And as a non-Methodist list maker, this project now comes off mine, and Caroline will be crossing it off our white board tomorrow, a very satisfying ritual. Esquires should hit soon and will hopefully be as positive. Then its just 60 left, and I feel good about that too. I would say that the one thing thats going to continue to be annoying is people pressing you on how long youll serve. When Tavis got you to say you probably wont for 8 years, that was especially stupid newsmaking on his part. Hirsh tried it with four, and I think others will. Might just be easiest to say, Ive learned not to predict the future - including my own - but I intend to and hope to. We have a lot to do, so much that weve started, and I want to see it through. Or just a simple I hope to If you dont you dont nobodys going to call you on saying you intended to a year earlier. Again, the 8 years was especially dumb speculation But these questions are really code for are you happy, are you being treated well, do you have enough juice?

Let me know if u want us to set up call Points: - We condemn the effort to remove Zelaya from office. - We are working within the OAS and with our regional partners to resolve this situation quickly and in a manner that restores democratic order. °- We appreciate the role Spain played in winning quick EU condemnation of the coup attempt. - Our work is not done. Rebuilding trust among competing political institutions and reducing polarization within Honduras will take a lot of work. We hope Spain will work with us and the OAS to ensure a restoration of democratic order that will allow Honduras to carry through with it electoral timetable (presidential vote scheduled for November) Note from torn: Aside from the statements issued by the President and the Secretary, we have been working in the OAS Permanent Council fashioning a consensus resolution mapping out a path forward, reaching out to regional partners ( I have spoken twice with Salvadoran President Funes, and our Ambassadors have been working with other Central American leaders), and working within Honduras to limit the damage to Honduras institutions. ; 1ro

C05772616	sbwhoeop Saturday, October 9, 2010 10:50 AM H: Dems should demand Boehner remove this GOP Nazi reenactor. Put Boehner in this blitzkrieg. Sid Why is This GOP House Candidate Dressed as a Nazi? By Joshua Green An election year already notable for its menagerie of extreme and unusual candidates can add another one: Rich lott, the Republican nominee for Congress from Ohio's 9th District, and a Tea Party favorite, who for years donned a German Waffen SS uniform and participated in Nazi re-enactments. Rich lott, second from right, in a Nazi SS Waffen uniform. lott, whose district lies in Northwest Ohio, was involved with a group that calls itself Wiking, whose members are devoted to re-enacting the exploits of an actual Nazi division, the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which fought mainly on the Eastern Front during World War 11. lott's participation in the Wiking group is not mentioned on his campaign's website, and his name and photographs were removed from the Wiking website.When contacted by The Atlantic, lott confirmed his involvement with the group over a number of years, but said his interest in Nazi Germany was historical and he does not subscribe to the tenets of Nazism. \No, absolutely not,\ he said. \In fact, theres a disclaimer on the [Wiking] website. And youll find that on almost any reenactment website. its purely historical interest in World War II.\ Rich lott and his wife, as shown on his campaign website. lott, a member of the Ohio Military Reserve, added, \Ive always been fascinated by the fact that here was a relatively small country that from a strictly military point of view accomplished incredible things. I mean, they took over most of Europe and Russia, and it really took the combined effort of the free world to defeat them. From a purely historical military point of view, thats incredible.\ lott says the group chose the Wiking division in part because it fought on the Eastern Front, mainly against the Russian Army, and not U.S. or British soldiers. The groups website includes a lengthy history of the Wiking unit, a recruitment video, and footage of goose-stepping German soldiers marching in the Warsaw victory parade after Poland fell in 1939. The website makes scant mention of the atrocities committed by the Waffen SS, and includes only a glancing reference to the \twisted\ nature of Nazism. Instead, it emphasizes how the Wiking unit fought Bolshevist Communism: Nazi Germany had no problem in recruiting the multitudes of volunteers willing to lay down their lives to ensure a \New and Free Europe\, free of the threat of Communism. National Socialism was seen by - many in Holland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other eastern European and Balkan countries as the protector of personal freedom and their very way of life, despite the true underlying totalitarian (and quite twisted, in most cases) nature of the movement. Regardless, thousands upon thousands of valiant men died defending their respective countries in the name of a better tomorrow. We salute these idealists; no matter how unsavory the Nazi government was, the front-line soldiers of the Waffen-SS (in particular the foreign volunteers) gave their lives for their loved ones and a basic desire to be free. Historians of Nazi Germany vehemently dispute this characterization. \These guys don't know their history,\ said Charles W. Sydnor, Jr., a retired history professor and author of \Soldiers of Destruction: The SS Death's Head Division, 1933-45,\ which chronicles an SS division. \They have a sanitized, romanticized view of what occurred.\ Sydnor added that re- enactments like the Wiking groups are illegal in Germany and Austria. \If you were to put on an SS uniform in Germany today, youd be arrested.\ See web-only content: http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/ Christopher Browning, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said, \It is so unhistorical and so apologetic that you dont know to what degree theyve simply caught up innocent war memorabilia enthusiasts who love putting on uniforms.\ loft says he does not recall exactly when he joined the Wiking group (his name appears on a unit roster as far back as 2003), but did so with his son \as a father-son bonding thing.\ He says his name and pictures were removed from the Wiking website not out of concern that they would harm his political career, but because he quit the group three years ago, after his son lost interest. loft participated in the group under his own name, and also under the alias \Reinhard Pferdmann,\ which has also been removed, and which lott described as being his German alter ego. \Part of the reenactors [experience],\ lott said, \is the living-history part, of really trying to get into the persona of the time period. In many, not just in our unit, but in many units what individuals do is create this person largely based on a Germanized version of their name, and a history kind of based around your own real experiences. Reinhard of course is Richard in German. And Pferdmann,\pferd' is a horse. So it's literally 'horse man.\ Asked whether his participation in a Nazi re-enactors group might not upset voters, particularly Jewish voters, loft said he hoped it would not: \They have to take it in context. Theres reenactors out there who do everything. You couldnt do Civil War re-enacting if somebody didnt play the role of the Confederates. [This] is something thats definitely way in the past. ... [I hope voters] take it in context and see it for what it is, an interest in World War II history. And thats strictly all.\ 0 lott at Nazi re-enactment. Rabbi Moshe Saks, of the Congregation B'nai Israel in Sylvania, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo that sits in the 9th district, disagreed. \Any kind of reenactment or glorification of Nazi Germany, to us, would be something unacceptable and certainly in poor taste, if not offensive,\ he said. \I think the reaction here will be very negative. And not just among the Jewish community, but the broader community.\ In a follow-up email today, loft seemed at pains to address concerns that his conduct may have alienated veterans groups but made no specific mention of possible offense to Jews or human rights groups: \Never, in any of my reenacting of military history, have I meant any disrespect to anyone who served in our military or anyone who has been affected by the tragedy of war. In fact, I have immense respect for veterans who served our country valiantly, and my respect of the military and our veterans is one of the reasons I have actively studied military history throughout my life.\ He added that he has participated in re-enactments as a Civil War Union infantryman, a World War I dough boy and World War II American infantryman and paratrooper. The actual Wiking unit has a history as grisly as that of other Nazi divisions. In her book \The Death Marches of Hungarian Jews Through Austria in the Spring of 1945,\ Eleonore Lappin, the noted Austrian historian, writes that soldiers from the Wiking division were involved in the killing of Hungarian Jews in March and April 1945, before surrendering to American forces in Austria. \What you often hear is that the [Wiking] division was never formally accused of anything, but thats kind of a dodge,\ says Prof. Rob Citino, of the Military History Center at the University of North Texas, who examined the Wiking website. \The entire German war effort in the East was a racial crusade to rid the world of subhumans, Slays were going to be enslaved in numbers of tens of millions. And of course the multimillion Jewish population of Eastern Europe was going to be exterminated altogether. Thats what all these folks were doing in the East. It sends a shiver up my spine to think that people want to dress up and play SS on the weekend.\ This article available online at: http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/why-is-this-gop-house-candidate-dressed-as-a-nazi/64319/ Copyright © 2010 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

C05770567	H: Im sure you are preoccupied with the adventures of Lula, et al. Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NY Review, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. Its worth reading, not least for Frank Luntzs poll numbers. The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly rooted in this long-term and profound development. Sid http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/jun/10/failure-american-jewish-establishment/ The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment June 10, 2010 by Peter Beinart E-mail Single Page Share More by Peter Beinart anjamin Netanyahu; drawing by John Springs In 2003, several prominent Jewish philanthropists hired Republican pollster Frank Luntz to explain why American Jewish college students were not more vigorously rebutting campus criticism of Israel. In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen. The philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didnt. \Six times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,\ he reported. \Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word 'they' rather than'us` to describe the situation.\ That Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and An Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that \non-Orthodox younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,\ with many professing \a near-total absence of positive feelings.\ In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state. Luntzs task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students views of Israel, he hit up against some firm beliefs. First, \they reserve the right to question the Israeli position.\ These young Jews, Luntz explained, \resist anything they see as 'group think.\ They want an \open and frank\ discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, \young Jews desperately want peace.\ When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled \Proof that Israel Wants Peace,\ and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, \some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians.\ When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends. Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment has been working against for most of their lives. Among American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster—indeed, have actively opposed—a Zionism that challenges Israels behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionisms door, and now, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead. Morally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox- dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States—so that American Jews can help save liberal Zionism in Israel—is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntzs students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israels current government, by no longer averting our eyes. Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, \After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions.\ One version, \founded on a long memory of persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in Jewish power and solidarity.\ Another, \nourished by secularized Versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment idea of progress,\ articulates \a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values.\ Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth. As Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism, particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority. You can see this spirit in \new historians\ like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the human rights guarantees in Israels \Basic Laws.\ You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Baraks apparent willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001. But in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government, its worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex–cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. \We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,\ he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into Netanyahus Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahus special emissary for overseas \campus engagement.\ In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli governments behalf. The group that organized his tour was called \Caravan for Democracy.\ Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitams views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahanes now banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Liebermans position might be called \pre-expulsion.\ He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who wont swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israels 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel. You dont have to be paranoid to see the connection between Liebermans current views and his former ones. The more you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of expulsion becomes. Liebermans American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israels border so that a large chunk of Israeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent. Lieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahus first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank, Netanyahus own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégés. In his 1993 book, A Place among the Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank, he has declared, would be a \ghetto-state\ with \Auschwitz borders.\ And the effort \to gouge Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] out of Israel\ resembles Hitlers bid to wrench the German-speaking \Sudeten district\ from Czechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the Jewish state. On the left of Netanyahus coalition sits Ehud Baraks emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas—like some of its Ashkenazi ultra- Orthodox counterparts—was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaisms profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shass immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs \vipers,\ \snakes,\ and \ants.\ In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that \God strike him down.\ The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama \an Islamic extremist.\ Hebrew University Professor Zeev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize. Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, \The last time politicians holding views similar to theirs were in power in post–World War II Western Europe was in Francos Spain.\ With their blessing, \a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order.\ Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house. Israeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school students—and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students— would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey \a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.\ You might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion substantial public concern—even outrage—among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy. (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an \apartheid state\ if it continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that \Israel has not been democratic for some time now.\) But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn for peace. The result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism. On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to \free speech and minority rights.\ The Conference of Presidents declares that \Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom, security and peace.\ These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very liberal values they profess to admire. After Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents' Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was \far more moderate than the media has presented it.\ Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti- Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that \Hes not saying expel them. Hes not saying punish them.\ (Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would \chill Israels democratic political debate.\ But the Forward summed up the overall response of Americas communal Jewish leadership in its headline \Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.\ Not only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a campaign to discredit the worlds most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians \bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic.\ The Conference of Presidents has announced that \biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and] Save the Children.\ Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch \has repeatedly demonstrated its anti-Israel bias.\ When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.) Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions—directing their outrage solely at Israels neighbors—they leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an \animus toward Israel,\ an alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like BTselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights, have been at least as critical of Israels actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. All of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israels overseas human rights critics are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israels domestic human rights critics? The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders dont generally say that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israels vice prime minister, Moshe Yaalon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a \virus.\ This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israels Gaza war. A Knesset member from Netanyahus Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Liebermans party launched an investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NG0s. To their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israels government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst. In the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism—with its idioms of human rights, equal citizenship, and territorial compromise—has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They dont want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right. These American Zionists are largely the product of a particular era. Many were shaped by the terrifying days leading up to the Six-Day War, when it appeared that Israel might be overrun, and by the bitter aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, when much of the world seemed to turn against the Jewish state. In that crucible, Israel became their Jewish identity, often in conjunction with the Holocaust, which the 1967 and 1973 wars helped make central to American Jewish life. These Jews embraced Zionism before the settler movement became a major force in Israeli politics, before the 1982 Lebanon war, before the first intifada. They fell in love with an Israel that was more secular, less divided, and less shaped by the culture, politics, and theology of occupation. And by downplaying the significance of Avigdor Lieberman, the settlers, and Shas, American Jewish groups allow these older Zionists to continue to identify with that more internally cohesive, more innocent Israel of their youth, an Israel that now only exists in their memories. But these secular Zionists arent reproducing themselves. Their children have no memory of Arab armies massed on Israels border and of Israel surviving in part thanks to urgent military assistance from the United States. Instead, they have grown up viewing Israel as a regional hegemon and an occupying power. As a result, they are more conscious than their parents of the degree to which Israeli behavior violates liberal ideals, and less willing to grant Israel an exemption because its survival seems in peril. Because they have inherited their parents liberalism, they cannot embrace their uncritical Zionism. Because their liberalism is real, they can see that the liberalism of the American Jewish establishment is fake. To sustain their uncritical brand of Zionism, therefore, Americas Jewish organizations will need to look elsewhere to replenish their ranks. They will need to find young American. Jews who have come of age during the West Bank occupation but are not troubled by it. And those young American Jews will come disproportionately from the Orthodox world. Because they marry earlier, intermarry less, and have more children, Orthodox Jews are growing rapidly as a share of the American Jewish population. According to a 2006 American Jewish Committee (AJC) survey, while Orthodox Jews make up only 12 percent of American Jewry over the age of sixty, they constitute 34 percent between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four. For Americas Zionist organizations, these Orthodox youngsters are a potential bonanza. In their yeshivas they learn devotion to Israel from an early age; they generally spend a year of religious study there after high school, and often know friends or relatives who have immigrated to Israel. The same AJC study found that while only 16 percent of non-Orthodox adult Jews under the age of forty feel \very close to Israel,\ among the Orthodox the figure is 79 percent. As secular Jews drift away from Americas Zionist institutions, their Orthodox counterparts will likely step into the breach. The Orthodox \are still interested in parochial Jewish concerns,\ explains Samuel Heilman, a sociologist at the City University of New York. \They are among the last ones who stayed in the Jewish house, so they now control the lights.\ But it is this very parochialism—a deep commitment to Jewish concerns, which often outweighs more universal ones— that gives Orthodox Jewish Zionism a distinctly illiberal cast. The 2006 AJC poll found that while 60 percent of non- Orthodox American Jews under the age of forty support a Palestinian state, that figure drops to 25 percent among the Orthodox. In 2009, when Brandeis Universitys Theodore Sasson asked American Jewish focus groups about Israel, he found Orthodox participants much less supportive of dismantling settlements as part of a peace deal. Even more tellingly, Reform, Conservative, and unaffiliated Jews tended to believe that average Palestinians wanted peace, but had been ill- served by their leaders. Orthodox Jews, by contrast, were more likely to see the Palestinian people as the enemy, and to deny that ordinary Palestinians shared any common interests or values with ordinary Israelis or Jews. Orthodox Judaism has great virtues, including a communal warmth and a commitment to Jewish learning unmatched in the American Jewish world. (Im biased, since my family attends an Orthodox synagogue.) But if current trends continue, the growing influence of Orthodox Jews in Americas Jewish communal institutions will erode even the liberal-democratic veneer that today covers American Zionism. In 2002, Americas major Jewish organizations sponsored a large Israel solidarity rally on the Washington Mall. Up and down the east coast, yeshivas shut down for the day, swelling the estimated Orthodox share of the crowd to close to 70 percent. When the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz told the rally that \innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well,\ he was booed. Americas Jewish leaders should think hard about that rally. Unless they change course, it portends the future: an American Zionist movement that does not even feign concern for Palestinian dignity and a broader American Jewish population that does not even feign concern for Israel. My own children, given their upbringing, could as easily end up among the booers as among Luntzs focus group. Either prospect fills me with dread. In 2004, in an effort to prevent weapons smuggling from Egypt, Israeli tanks and bulldozers demolished hundreds of houses in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. Watching television, a veteran Israeli commentator and politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother. In that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot—its unpleasant. Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster Zionism among Americas young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word \Arabs, not Palestinians,\ since \the term `Palestinians evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,\ while \Arab says wealth, oil and Islam.\ Of course, Israel—like the United States—must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents Conference should ask themselves what Israels leaders would have to do or say to make them scream \no.\ After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities; settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line? What infuriated critics about Lapids comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do. • But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about themselves. Many of Israels founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated the non-Jews living under their dominion. \For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,\ Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, \and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live with a minority.\ But the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the opposite: since Jews are historys permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, \Victimhood sets you free.\ This obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among Americas secular Jewish young. It simply bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israels. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish victimhood—a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967—strikes most of todays young American Jews as farce. But there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israels Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state \will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and peace taught by the Hebrew prophets,\ and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begins visit to the United States after his partys militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish fortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of Jewish power. For several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years, from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the face of Zionism shown to Americas Jewish young? What if the students in Luntzs focus group had been told that their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state on earth? \Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,\ writes Avraham Burg. \I was very comfortable there.\ I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral abdication. Lets hope that Luntzs students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an uncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be. Lets hope they care enough to try. —May 12, 2010 .

C05768882	sbwhoeop Thursday, March 25, 2010 10:16 AM H: Haaretz chief columnist on Bibis visit. Sid htto://www. haaretz.com/hasers/spagesil 158992. html Aluf Benn / Netanyahu leaves U.S. disgraced, isolated and weaker By Ake Berm Details emerging from Benjamin Netanyahus visit to Washington remain incomplete, but the conclusion may nonetheless be drawn that the prime minister erred in choosing to fly to the United States this week. The visit - touted as a fence- mending effort, a bid to strengthen the tenuous ties between Netanyahu and U.S. President Barack Obama - only highlighted the deep rift between the American and Israeli administrations. The prime minister leaves America disgraced, isolated, and altogether weaker than when he came. Instead of setting the diplomatic agenda, Netanyahu surrendered control over it. Instead of leaving the Palestinian issue aside and focusing on Iran, as he would like, Netanyahu now finds himself fighting for the legitimacy of Israeli control over East Jerusalem. Advertisement The most sensitive and insoluble core issues - those which when raised a decade ago led to the dissolution of the peace process and explosion of the second intifada - are now being served as a mere appetizer. At the start of his visit, Netanyahu was tempted to bask in the warm welcome he received at the AIPAC conference, at which he gave his emotional address on Jerusalem. Taking a page from Menachem Begin, he spoke not on behalf of the State of Israel, but in the name of the Jewish people itself and its millennia of history. His speech was not radical rightist rhetoric. Reading between the lines, one could spot a certain willingness to relinquish West Bank settlements as long as Israel maintains a security buffer in the Jordan Valley. But at the White House, the prime ministers speech to thousands of pro-Israel activists and hundreds of cheering congressmen looked like an obvious attempt to raise political capital against the American president. Knowing Netanyahu would be reenergized by his speech at the lobby, Obama and his staff set him a honey trap. Over the weekend they sought to quell the row that flared up during U.S. Vice President Joe Bidens trip here two weeks ago, and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described Netanyahus response to the ultimatums Washington presented to him as \useful.\ Special envoy George Mitchell made a televised visit to the prime ministers bureau Sunday to invite Netanyahu to the White House. Washington, it seemed, was trying to make nice. Far from it. Just when Netanyahu thought he had resolved the crisis by apologizing to Biden, Clinton called him up for a dressing down. This time as well, Netanyahu almost believed the crisis had passed, that he had survived by offering partial. noncommittal answers to the Americans questions. Shortly before meeting with Obama, Netanyahu even warned the Palestinians that should they continue to demand a freeze on construction, he would postpone peace talks by a year. His arrogant tone underscored the fact that Netanyahu believed that on the strength of his AIPAC speech, he could call the next few steps of the diplomatic dance. But then calamity struck. At their White House meeting, Obama made clear to his guest that the letter Netanyahu had sent was insufficient and returned it for further corrections. Instead of a reception as a guest of honor, Netanyahu was treated as a problem child, an army private ordered to do laps around the base for slipping up at roll call. The revolution in the Americans behavior is clear to all. On Sunday morning Obama was still anxiously looking ahead to the House of Representatives vote on health care - the last thing he wanted was a last-minute disagreement with congressmen over ties with Israel. The moment the bill was passed, however, a victorious Obama was free to deal with his unruly guest. The Americans made every effort to downplay the visit. As during his last visit in November, Netanyahu was invited to the White House at a late hour, without media coverage or a press conference. If that were not enough, the White House spokesman challenged Netanyahus observation at AIPAC that \Jerusalem is not a settlement.\ The Americans didnt even wait for him to leave Washington to make their disagreement known. It was not the behavior Washington shows an ally, but the kind it shows an annoyance. The approval of construction at the Shepherd Hotel in Sheikh Jarrah, announced before his meeting with Obama, again caught Netanyahu unawares. Apparently the special panel appointed after the Ramat Shlomo debacle to prevent such surprises failed its first test. Netanyahu is having his most difficult week since returning to office, beginning with the unfortunate decision to relocate the planned emergency room at Ashkelons Barzilai Medical Center and lasting through his humiliating jaunt through Washington. Returning to Israel today, Netanyahu will need to work hard to rehabilitate his image, knowing full well that Obama will not relent, but instead demand that he stop zigzagging and decide, once and for all, whether he stands with America or with the settlers.

Sid In light of Clegg's rising popularity partly based on his anti-Americanism and Germany's growing hegemony in Europe while becoming more insular, John Kornblum has written this op-ed with reference in last graphs to US policy. 7.71 April 23, 2010 I.H.T. Op-Ed Contributor Germany in Need of a Dream By JOHN KORNBLUM Has Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no longer the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the Fraulein Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested? As a former American ambassador who has lived arid worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my Blackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same: Germany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma. Germany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German society. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and peace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus. From the first days of the Federal Republic. Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely within a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not remove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions. Many important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of others — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany pushed them with determination. Helmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a common currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard. The euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s eastward expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank. Slowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way, Germany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by Germany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in pursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others. A new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. \Europe\ in the institutional sense has become increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the German Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate assistance to Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a German Tea Party? Here we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the \motor of Europe.\ Ms. Merkel's unwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German willingness to \salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,\ as Konrad Adenauer used to put it. Germans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who can do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self- denial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that characterizes many E.U. programs. Most maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is whether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so sure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a globalized world. And so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that Germany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue aricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others when it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland. The growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to burden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense of common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will themselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream. Younger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when they rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to \Dare to Hope,\ which is the characteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America seems busy elsewhere. The main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a democratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to haggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for Germany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance. Uniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be joined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness more energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will be assured. European fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and the United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its side of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope. John Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001.

C05761920	sure -- bottom line - you need a special security code to get on line from a computer outside the building. Only 1 in 5 of our employees has gotten the device (fob) that allows you to do this access. This effort is making sure they get fobs into the hands of more (or all) employees so folks can work from home thereby increasing productivity substantially since the 4 in 5 essentially do no work from home once they leave the building until they get in again b/c they don't have access to their email. cdm
C05767695	Ur email must be back up!! What happened is Judith sent you an email. It bounced back. She called the email help desk at state (I guess assuming u had state email) and told them that.
