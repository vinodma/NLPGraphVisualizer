C05767623	http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6991697.ece From The Times January 18, 2010 Fear of the poor is hampering Haiti rescue American views rule among the rubble of Port-au-Prince. That's one reason aid is taking so long to get to those in need Linda Polman Aid workers have already baptised the earthquake in Haiti a \historical disaster\. It will rate high in the annals of the humanitarian aid world because of the number of victims and scale of the destruction. But the rescue operation is also becoming notorious for the slowness with which aid is reaching the victims. Five days after the quake hit, many places are still largely bereft of international aid. Not through lack of funds, supplies or emergency experts. Those are all pouring in from dozens of countries. But most of the aid — and aid workers — seems stuck at the airport. Rescue teams have pulled survivors from five-star hotels, university buildings, a supermarket and the UN headquarters, all in Port-au-Prince's better neighbourhoods. In poor areas, where the damage appears much greater, apparently forgotten victims report on Twitter that they have yet to encounter the first foreign rescuer. Many aid workers are reported to have orders not to venture out without armed guards — which are not there at all, or only after long debates with the UN military command. The UN has lost a number of staff in the quake, and is not keen to risk more lives. But the Haitian people seem to scare aid workers more than Somali warlords, Darfuri Janjawid or Afghan Taleban. Frightened Dutch aid workers abandoned a mission without•reaching the collapsed building where people were trapped, and frightened doctors have left their patients unattended. The experience of CNN's medical reporter, Dr Sanjay Gupta, is telling. In a makeshift clinic he encountered a Belgian medical team being evacuated in a UN bus. UN \rules of engagement\ apparently stopped them providing security for the doctors. The Belgians took most of their medical supplies with them, to keep them out of the claws of robbers. Dr Gupta and his camera team stayed the night, monitored the abandoned patients' vital signs and continued intravenous drips — and they were not robbed. Some rescuers are leaning so much toward security that they will allow people to die. The media are not helping. CNN rules in the rubble. \Outside of a military conflict, this is our biggest international deployment since the tsunami in 2004,\ according to Tony Maddox, the managing director of CNN International. So the image of the aid operation being beamed back is primarily Ameridan — and one of the big problems is the American view of Haiti. CNN won't stop telling aid workers and the outside world about pillaging (the incidence of which — for the first four frustrating days at least — did not compare with what happened after Hurricane Katrina) and about how dangerous it is to distribute food, because of the likelihood of \stampedes\. Nor is the US Government, the biggest player in the aid operation, doing anything to help to relax the atmosphere. On the contrary. When President Obama said that the US aid effort would be \aggressive\ he meant it. The humanitarian operation is not led by civilian agencies, but by the Pentagon. Mr Obama ordered 9,000 troops and a fleet of nuclear-powered ships to move in. Victims of the war in Congo (which has cost five million lives in the past years) and of the genocide in Darfur would love so much American attention — but it is Haiti's fate to lay in America's backyard and to have been a sore to American eyes for decades already. One, perhaps even two million Haitians already live in the United States, but more try to come. Every day dead Haitian refugees wash up on Miami's sunny beaches. Haiti is a constant pain for US taxpayers who feel that the billions of dollars that have been poured in should have at least lifted the country out of its position as one of the poorest places on Earth. Even when the earthquake struck, investigations were taking place into the fate of several million dollars of aid funds, sent to victims of a hurricane that hit Haiti in 2008, that have disappeared. Furthermore, to the horror of many godfearing Americans, voodoo is an officially recognised religion in Haiti. And, perhaps above all, Haitians are poor and black. In the view of some Americans those two add up to ... murderous gangs. The invasion of soldiers and humanitarian workers at the airport of Port-au-Prince reminds me of the American military invasion of Haiti authorised by President Clinton in 1994. I'd lived and worked there for almost two years as a correspondent for Dutch radio. There were 20,000 soldiers but they were surprisingly nervous about what reception the unarmed Haitians might have in store for them. It turned out to be a wave of slum dwellers streaming to the air and sea port to greet the American guests. In abundant conga lines they snaked through the city, tea cosies on their heads to express just how happy they were. \Liberte! Merci Beel Cling Dong!\ they shouted. A terrified American GI, still a teenager, saw the mass of pitiful creatures approaching him, and asked me if the tea cosies were \some kinda voodoo?\. He calmed down only when a line of BMWs and Mitsubishis appeared and filed past to watch the invasion. Where the soldier came from, the owners of vehicles like these are respectable citizens. In Haiti, they are likely to be the ones smuggling drugs and making US aid dollars disappear. The good guys in Haiti are the defenceless people in the slums. For Western city dwellers, this is the world turned upside down. \Back! Back!\ the soldier shouted, aiming his weapons at the good guys. The rescue teams that stay put at the airport are one reason why we still don't really know what is going on. Seventy survivors had been pulled from the rubble so far, the International Red Cross said on Sunday. That's 14 rescues per day as a joint result of the 1,739 international specialised rescue workers that are there. That number would surely jump if some of the professional equipment that they brought was made available to the countless groups of local people desperately digging for victims with their bare hands, day and night. Let's hope that the food distributors worrying about their safety know that yesterday hundreds of people in Port-au-Prince dropped to their knees praying outside a warehouse where workers for the agency Food for the Poor had announced that they would be distributing rice and beans. The crowd allowed children and the elderly to go first in line without having guns aimed at them first.

C05770840	Netanyahu pleased: I didn't capitulate Ben Caspit, Maariv, May 27 2010 [page 2 with front page lead; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post] In the course of intimate conversations over the past few weeks with top political officials and civil servants, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, according to his interlocutors, that he managed to defeat the US administration. Netanyahu is pleased by the fact that the Americans failed, so he said, to twist his arm and that ultimately, in the duel between him and the Obama administration, he was the one who emerged with the upper hand. We did not make concessions on our red lines and they failed to make us fold and to drag us to places we didn't want to go, said Netanyahu, according to people who heard him speak. Netanyahu is convinced that he is not going to be forced to extend the settlement construction freeze, which is due to expire in September. According to senior officials in Jerusalem, an agreement has already been reached with the administration that the Israeli government will not announce an extension of the construction freeze in the territories, and the Americans will \make sure\ that the Palestinians do not withdraw from the talks. Israel, however, will not take \aggressive\ action and construction will be resumed only in areas that are clearly within the consensus inside the settlement blocs. The Prime Minister 's Bureau vigorously denied the above report. \The statements attributed to the prime minister are incorrect,\ said a spokesman in the Prime Minister's Bureau. \They were not said by Netanyahu in any forum. The reason is simple: the prime minister does not think that, Prime Minister Netanyahu holds in great esteem the commitment by President Obama and the administration to Israels security and their efforts to renew the peace process in our region.\ Eli Bardenstein adds: The formal invitation that Netanyahu received yesterday to meet with President Obama next week might attest to a radical change in the White Houses attitude towards him. Political sources in Israel described the planned meeting as \the peak of the campaign for Israel and the Jews that has been pursued by the Obama administration in the past number of weeks.\ The sources said that the meeting was geared to put an end to the grave crisis that erupted some two months ago between the Obama administration and Netanyahu over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and particularly over the continued construction in East Jerusalem, and to mend the mistaken impression that was received as if Israel was \no longer an absolute ally of the United States.\ That crisis, which was initiated by the Americans, elicited fierce criticism in the United States, and sparked a desire among members of the Obama administration to rectib) the situation. Another reason for the administrations desire to end the crisis is the fear offailure in the upcoming Congressional elections in November. \The Democratic Partys coffers are empty. Many Democrat members of Congress and Senators have complained that if the hazing of Israel were to continue, they would be unable to obtain donations from Jews and were liable to lose the elections,\ said one source in Washington. The prevalent assessment is that Netanyahu will be received far more warmly in Washington next week than he was two months ago. This time the meeting will be covered by the media and the two leaders are expected to have their picture taken together and to give statements to the media. That said, sources in Washington noted that \Netanyahu is leery of the meeting with Obama and of walking into a trap once again. He knows that the smiles notwithstanding, behind closed doors he is going to have to give answers to very difficult questions, like how do you envision the end of the negotiations with the Palestinians.\ Netanyahu is to begin his political travels today in Paris, where he is to attend the ceremony in honor of Israel's acceptance into the OECD. The prime minister will be arriving in a city that is on strike, which is liable to impede his movement through the city streets to the center of Paris for his meetings.
C05763715	Jake, when you can, I think I speak for the group when I say that we'd like and After Action Report on last night's date with Dr. Senkler - especially curious if your plan to transition from the initial expanded group to a more restricted bilateral meeting worked as planned. And while I'm writing, here is about the most straightforward piece about HRC ever written in the NY Times - with this classic line: \...a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud funny noises whenever she said something striking.\ Clinton Ends Africa Tour, Vowing to Stay Involved By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN The New York Times Published: August 15, 2009 SANTA MARIA, Cape Verde - After a grueling seven-nation, 11-day trip, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrapped up her Africa tour on Friday by reaffirming her promise to renovate American relations with the continent. \I leave Africa after this remarkable trip even more committed,\ Mrs. Clinton said before leaving Cape Verde. \I have seen the joy and energy Africans have, evidenced not just by the boogieing, but by the hard work and perseverance,\ she said, referring to a recent comment from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, that she knew how to \boogie\ with African dancers. \And weve seen the worst humanity can do to itself,\ she added, presumably referring to Congo, where Mrs. Clinton met victims of a brutal civil war that just does not seem to end. Mrs. Clinton seemed satisfied that she had accomplished her mission: strengthening American relations with crucial allies on the continent, like Nigeria and South Africa, and sending a message of \tough love,\ as she called it, to nations like Kenya and Congo. Over all, she said, the United States wants to work more closely with African nations as a partner, not simply as a patron or dispenser of aid. In exchange, she said, African leaders must deliver democracy and good government. Mrs. Clinton vowed to stay on top of Africa, even after she gets back to Washington, closely monitoring the issues she addressed on her tour. She also pointed to Cape Verde, a set of palm-studded islands best known for their beaches and enormous tourist hotels, as an example of what good leadership can do. \This is possible,\ she said. \You create not just economic growth but a sense of human dignity and possibility.\ Kenya. South Africa. Angola. Congo. Nigeria. Liberia. And finally Cape Verde. Mrs. Clinton saw with her own eyes some of Africas most promising countries - and some of its most troubled ones. In Kenya, she pushed for the government to prosecute perpetrators of the postelection violence last year. In South Africa, the big issue was Zimbabwe and how the South African government should do more to help ease the crisis there. In Angola, the theme was good governing practices and oil, a strategic concern of the United States given the many inroads China has made there and elsewhere in Africa in its hunger for natural resources. In Congo, Mrs. Clinton was passionate about the need to end the nations rape epidemic. \The secretarys visit to the heart of the worlds deadliest war zone in eastern Congo was a potential game-changer for that conflict,\ said John Prendergast, a founder of the Washington-based Enough project. \Her commitment to addressing root causes such as the conflict minerals that power our electronics industry was a refreshing contrast to the usual disaster sympathy tourism of visiting dignitaries.\ \Now,\ he added, \comes the hard part: making good on the promises and living up to the high expectations engendered by her visit.\ In Nigeria, Mrs. Clinton pressed for electoral changes. In Liberia, she praised the countrys president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the only woman in Africa to be elected head of state. The Liberian visit had a special warmth, almost like a meeting of long-lost cousins. Liberia was founded in the 19th century by freed American slaves, and the countrys flag, the peoples names and even the police uniforms with plastic- brimmed hats were all reminiscent of the American versions. Mrs. Clinton received possibly her most exuberant welcome there, and a Liberian man with a long wooden horn followed her around most of the visit, blowing out loud funny noises whenever she said something striking. \I love that - the horn - I want to take that guy with me wherever I go,\ she said. In Cape Verde, Mrs. Clinton seemed to have few bones to pick. For once, she said, she had a cheat sheet on a country that included a list of far more positives than negatives. The country has fewer than 500,000 people and has escaped the turmoil that has engulfed so much of Africa. The all-inclusive, poolside buffet resorts here feel like something found in CanctIn or the Bahamas. Mrs. Clinton called Cape Verde \a model of democracy and economic progress in Africa.\ On Friday, just as she had at every stop, she started her speech by saying, \I bring you greetings from President Obama.\ She called him a \son of Africa\ and said that under the Obama administration, the United States was determined to help Africa reach its promise.

Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), who were barely on speaking terms a few years ago, joined forces with the nationalist SDLP in the Northern Ireland assembly to endorse a deal on policing, hammered out last month. The justice minister will be appointed on 12 April and is likely to be David Ford, the leader of the centrist Alliance party. The breakthrough was marred by a row when the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), which governed Northern Ireland for five decades until the imposition of direct rule in 1972, voted against the deal. Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, who recently formed an electoral pact with the Conservatives, said he had voted no because his party did not believe that the four-party power-sharing executive was functioning properly. Empey, the minister for employment and learning, said: \We exercise our rights, refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks.\ The UUP hit out after facing intense pressure from London and the US to fall in behind David Cameron, who has backed devolution of the criminal justice system. Gordon Brown phoned Empey shortly before today's vote, while former US president George Bush pleaded with Cameron last week to persuade the UUP to support the deal. Empey's unionist rivals, the DUP, who have overtaken the UUP in recent years, focused on what could happen after the vote. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, who managed to persuade all but one of his 36 assembly members to back the devolution deal, said: \The move is about completing and maintaining devolution, it is about whether we move forward together as a society.\ The vote secures an extra £800m for policing and justice that Brown promised the assembly if they backed the transfer. It also adds an extra 1,200 police officers. The prime minister praised the main parties for reaching the deal on an issue that almost broke the power-sharing government. He said: \Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland. The completion of devolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.\ The vote was also praised tonight by Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state. She said: \I commend the Northern Ireland Assembly for its affirmation of the Hillsborough Agreement and its endorsement of the devolution of policing and justice, an important step in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous future for all of the people of Northern Ireland for generations to come.\ Irish president Mary McAleese also hailed the move. \Todays vote in the Northern Ireland assembly represents an eloquent statement of confidence in the political institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement,\ she said. Matt Baggott, chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, welcomed the vote as a step forward. \Devolution will strengthen our service. It will help to ensure communities receive the policing service that not only they deserve, but that we are committed to delivering. \The financial package is also welcomed ... it will help us deal with those who are living in the darkness of the past and who have tried to disrupt this process and the lives of our community.\ But there was discord inside Stormont after the UUP and their 17-strong assembly team voted against the move. Martin McGuinness, Sinn Feins deputy first minister, denounced the UUP stance, claiming they were doing it to embarrass the DUP. \The UUP declared last night [Monday] that they will not support this resolution,\ McGuinness told the assembly. \That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons.\ He stressed that no single party could control the justice department. The UUP no-vote will put pressure on the Tories, who will campaign with their allies in the general election, having taken opposing sides on the biggest vote since the DUP and Sinn Fein started sharing power in 2007. Cameron insisted that the Tories had played a constructive role, saying he would maintain his alliance with the UUP. \We want to move Northern Ireland politics forward — to focus on the issues that affect people in their everyday lives — rather than remaining stuck in the past. That is why we remain totally committed to bringing national, mainstream UK politics to Northern Ireland and to ending its semi-detached political status.\ Camerons remarks were designed, in part, to reassure the White House, which fears a UUP no-vote could harden unionist opinion against power-sharing. Hardline Unionists turned on the DUP tonight. Jim Allister, the former DUP MEP, who now leads the breakaway Traditional Unionist Voice, claimed his former party had \rolled over in triple somersaults for Sinn Fein\. He also suggested the new justice minister would be a \pointless puppet keeping the seat warm for Sinn Fein\. Prior to the vote the widow of the first Police Service of Northern Ireland officer to be murdered by dissident republicans urged all parties to back the devolution of policing and justice powers. Kate Carroll, whose husband, Stephen, was killed by a Continuity IRA sniper, said in an appeal to the UUP: \It is heartbreaking that I have to get on this morning to please ask the politicians to get on with their job.\

Sid H: In case you haven't seen the Wash Post piece today, here is Pat Lang's brief commentary and then below that the piece itself. Sid Men on Horseback 1; 1 e NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the senior administration official as limiting military operations \in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two goals -- to prevent al-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government.\ The use of resource- intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to be restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said. \The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy,\ Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week, using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. \This is not go out and occupy the whole country. \ \ Washbost It appears that the Afghan policy war is not over. Chandrasekaran is a good reporter but not good enough to get this unaided. Soo°, someone(s) at the NSC briefed him so that the message would be delivered to the \other team\ that their behavior is being watched closely and that the NSC team is prepared to use the public media as a weapon if need be. The reporter then went to the Defense Department where he was told their side of the story. Secretary Gates appears to have become the leader of the pentagon faction Petraeus is interestingly absent from this nearly open struggle. He will wait to see what the outcome may be. A major confrontation over policy and presidential authority is coming. The policy review scheduled for July 2010 may well precipitate it. pl 26 December 2009 in Afahanistan, gpvernment, Policy, Pali .s perm.aiin4c Civilian, military planners have different views on new approach to Afghanistan By Rajiv Chandrasekaran Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday, December 26, 2009; A01 Two days before announcing the deployment of additional U.S. troops to 8fg,rianistan, President Obama informed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal that he was not granting McChrystals request to double the size of the Afghan army and police. Cost was a factor, as were questions about whether the capacity exists to train 400,000 personnel. The president told McChrystal, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, to focus for now on fielding a little more than half that number by next October. Ten days after Obamas speech, the U.S. command responsible for training the Afghans circulated a chart detailing the combined personnel targets for the army and police. McChrystals goal of 400,000 remained unchanged. \Its an open issue,\ a senior Pentagon official said last week. Nearly a month after Obama unveiled his revised Afghanistan strategy, military and civilian leaders have come away with differing views of several fundamental aspects of the president's new approach, according to more than a dozen senior administration and military officials involved in Afghanistan policy, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Members of Obama's war cabinet disagree over the meaning of his pledge to begin drawing down forces in July 2011 and whether the mission has been narrowed from a proposal advanced by McChrystal in his August assessment of the war. The disagreements have opened a fault line between a desire for an early exit among several senior officials at the White House and a conviction among military commanders that victory is still achievable on their terms. The differences are complicating implementation of the new strategy. Some officers have responded to the July 2011 date by seeking to accelerate the pace of operations, instead of narrowing them. At the White House, a senior administration official said, the National Security Council is discussing ways to increase monitoring of military and State Department activities in Afghanistan to prevent \overreaching.\ The NSC's strategic guidance, a classified document that outlines the president's new approach, was described by the senior administration official as limiting military operations \in scale and scope to the minimum required to achieve two goals -- to prevent ai-Qaeda safe havens and to prevent the Taliban from toppling the government.\ The use of resource- intensive counterinsurgency tactics -- employing U.S. forces to protect Afghan civilians from the Taliban -- is supposed to be restricted to key cities and towns in southern and eastern parts of the country, the official said. \The strategy has fundamentally changed. This is not a COIN strategy,\ Vice President Biden said on MSNBC last week, using the military's shorthand for counterinsurgency. \This is not go out and occupy the whole country. \ Setting limits During a videoconference two days before the speech, Obama made it clear to McChristal and U.S. Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry that he did not want the additional troops to fuel a broader mission. Speaking to both men from the White House Situation Room, the president told them not to deploy the forces to areas they would not be able to transfer to Afghan security forces by July 2011, according to two senior officials with knowledge of the conversation. Obama's essential instruction was, according to one of the officials, \Dont bite off more than you can chew.\ White House officials said the president opposes using the forces he has authorized to duplicate an expansive, iraq-style counterinsurgency operation -- in part because he questions whether it will be possible to achieve a similar outcome in Afghanistan, which is less developed, and because he wants to start reducing troops in 18 months. The White Houses desired end state in Afghanistan, officials said, envisions more informal local security arrangements than in Iraq, a less- capable national government and a greater tolerance of insurgent violence. Senior military officials still think they can achieve a better outcome than envisaged by civilian skeptics in the administration by using the new forces to mount more comprehensive counterinsurgency operations. Although Pentagon strategists and McChrystals advisers in Kabul are looking at how they can fulfill the White House desire for a less extensive mission, military officials said they are reluctant to strip too much away and weaken an approach that has come to be revered within the ranks as the only way to suppress guerrilla movements. Military officials contend that McChrystal does not harbor expansionist aims. They note that he has begun removing troops from remote mountain valleys and concentrating resources on a modest number of key population centers. But the approach in those areas will involve counterinsurgency tactics: Troops will focus on restoring normal patterns of life by trying to keep the Taliban at bay, helping the Afghan government provide basic services to the population and training local security forces. McChrystals plan, the senior Pentagon official said, \is still counterinsurgency, regardless of the various agendas people are trying to spin.\ Dissent over drawdown During strategy discussions at the White House, differences between the White House and the military came into sharp relief over °baffles decision to announce his intention to begin drawing down troops in July 2011. McChrystal argued against it, according to three officials familiar with the process. The head of the U.S. Central Command, Gen. David H. Petraeus, also expressed concerns. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged Obama to make the drawdoWn \conditions-based.\ \There was a lot of push back\ from the Defense Department, one of the officials said. The president received cover from one uniformed general at the table, James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright had adopted a more skeptical view of the mission than many of his military colleagues, one that resonated with Obama and Biden. Cartwright effectively endorsed the July 2011 date, arguing that increasing forces and engaging in limited counterinsurgency made sense, the senior administration official said, \but given the risk factors -- Pakistan, the Karzai government, the whole notion of sub-national governance and our track record with the [Afghan security forces], which is not prestigious -- that it made sense to demonstrate that we could actually do this.\ It. also helped Obama that the principal troop-increase proposal being discussed at the time -- a recommendation that McChrystal receive 30,000 forces for 18 to 24 months -- had been developed by Gates. The Defense Department paperwork detailing the proposal identified the increase as starting in the summer of 2009, when the first troops deployed by the president this year began conducting operations in Afghanistan, but it did not specify an end date. \Rather than leaving this indefinite and hypothetical, the presidents intervention was to say, Okay, if were starting in July of 09, then were really talking about July of 11,\ said the senior administration official who described the NSC guidance. Obama eventually told his war cabinet that he would announce the July 2011 deadline but that the pace of withdrawals would be determined, as Gates had sought, by conditions on the ground. Obama said he would conduct a thorough review of progress in a years time. Although he did not endorse McChrystals request to increase the Afghan security forces to 400,000, he said he would reevaluate the issue once the 2010 goal of training 230,000 forces is achieved. The president avoided details in his Dec. 1 address, leaving it up to members of his Cabinet and to his advisers to explain the specifics. The result has been a wide divergence of expectations. Gates, appearing on NBCs \Meet the Press\ the Sunday after the speech, said that perhaps only \some handful or some small number\ would be withdrawn. Biden, during his MSNBC appearance last week, said a chart showing an increase in U.S. deployments this year would be \coming down as rapidly over the next two years.\ The ambiguity over the meaning of the July 2011 deadline has generated uncertainty over the presidents intent. \Is the surge a way of helping us leave more quickly, or is the timeline a way to help win support for the surge?\ asked a senior Democratic staff member in Congress. \Which is the strategy and which is the head-fake? Nobody knows.\ One senior military officer in Afghanistan said he and his fellow soldiers \don't know if this is all over in 18 months, or whether this is just a progress report that leads to minor changes.\ \Until they tell us otherwise,\ the officer said, \we're operating as if the latter is the policy.\ A dramatic change? Although senior-level civilians in the administration emerged from the review process thinking the mission had been circumscribed, senior military officials continue to have a different view. The result, as they see it, is that the White House has embraced McChrystals original plan. \We had already been pretty focused that we wouldnt try to clear and hold things more than we needed to,\ said a senior commander involved in the war. \It wasnt a dramatic change by any means.\ White House officials have cited a meeting among NSC staff members and McChrystal in which the general displayed a slide stating that his mission was to \Defeat the Taliban,\ which some civilians deemed overly ambitious because it suggested that every last member of the Taliban would have to be killed or captured. The officials said the mission was redefined to avoid the term. But to military officers, defeat \doesnt mean wipe everyone out,\ the commander said. \It means after Waterloo, Napoleon still had an army but he wasnt going to threaten Europe. We used that view when we worked defeat.\ Even before the White House review had finished, the commander in charge of day-to-day operations, Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, had developed a plan to concentrate U.S. and NATO efforts in 80 of the countrys nearly 400 districts. \They're taking credit for some of the things that McChrystal was already doing and calling it a narrowed focus,\ a senior military official said. White House advisers maintain that the review process did refine the mission beyond what McChrystal had proposed over the summer. \There was a real narrowing here,\ the senior administration official said. \Stan has a big leadership task to adapt his original concept to the new strategic guidance.\ The official said NSC officials recognize it will take time for the new orders to filter through the ranks. \This doesn't turn around with a speech,\ the official said. \But I hope we don't see slides a month from now that continue to state that our goal is 400,000\ Afghan security forces. The challenge, said that official and another senior administration official, is to recalibrate military operations over the next 18 months in accordance with the new goal. \The guidance they have is that we're not doing everything, and we're not doing it forever,\ the second official said. \The hardest intellectual exercise will be settling on how much is enough.\ For now, however, top military officers speak more expansively than White House advisers. \Winning means we hand off to a security force that can secure the country,\ the senior Pentagon official said. \We've separated the enemy, we've connected the people to the government, and we're helping them to rebuild their economy. It's at that point that we begin to transition it over to them.\ Terms such as \winning\ and \victory\ have been eschewed by the White House. Obama did not use either in his Dec. 1 address, and he said in an interview earlier this year that he was uncomfortable using the term \victory\ when fighting \a non-state actor, a shadowy operation like al-Qaeda.\ But when Gates visited Kabul a week after Obamas speech, he made a point of telling military personnel there that \we are in this thing to win.\ \From a moral perspective, when you ask soldiers and families to sacrifice, we do that to win,\ the Pentagon official said. \We need to be able to articulate winning.\

C05773961	aned by Woodwards Fire by Leslie H. Gelb September 23, 2010 I 1:32pm The president and his team cooperated with the famed authors new book. Leslie H. Gelb on the fallout—and how Obamas Wars shows the U.S. is stuck in an open-ended conflict. Lots of White House officials observed Bob Woodward, Mr. First Draft of History, repeatedly and boldly slipping behind the closed doors of President Obamas most intimate advisers. They all knew what was happening. The presidents men were helping The Washington Posts sleuth write \the inside story\ of how the boss masterfully managed the most trying of Herculean labors—the war in Afghanistan. Theres only one very big problem in dealing with Woodward in this manner: Once the boss opens the doors to spilling the secrets, many of his subordinates feel liberated to \tell their side of the story.\ By the time each has exhausted tales of his own heroism and the shortcomings of his fellow senior officials, well, no one looks terribly heroic. Lets start with Obama, who emerges from the pages of Obamas Wars as he is—brilliant, emotionless, abstract, focused, and confused, a Chicago law-school professor in presidents clothes. He obviously wanted Woodward to portray him as a brilliant intellectual leader of a government that was not giving him too much help in solving the Afghan mystery, but that he trudged on, doing the best anyone possibly could under these terrible circumstances. The worst circumstance, as Team Obama alleged to Woodward, was that the Pentagon leadership and the U.S. generals did not give him the real choices he was asking for. He wanted options for troop increases below, even far below, what the generals were giving him. He didnt get them. He wanted a strategy for how U.S. forces would be drawn down after they reached their projected peak of about 100,000 (more than three times the number George W. Bush left him). The military didnt provide him with that, either. As they say in Missouri, \Give me a break.\ If the commander in chief of the United States doesnt know how to get what he wants from the U.S. military, he might want to do something about that. And some of the many generals in the White House who he picked to guide him might have told him how to go about that task. To cut to the chase: Obama didnt understand what he had to do—tell Defense Secretary Bob Gates to tell the generals either they meet the presidents wishes or they will be fired. Republican presidents do just that. And so, as Woodward describes, Obama had to write the strategy all by himself. This was and still is an awful situation that springs from two sources. One is that the president has just not been clear enough about his thinking and objectives for Afghanistan, and the military and the rest of us must have real clarity to pursue wars. Woodward has this right. Here are a few Obama quotes that illustrate the problem. The president told Woodward that he didnt think about the Afghan war in the \classic\ terms of the U.S. winning or losing. \I think about it more in terms of: Do you successfully prosecute a strategy that results in the country being stronger rather than weaker at the end?\ What on earth does that mean? Or try this one, to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about whether the July 2011 deadline to begin withdrawal was firm: \I have to say that. I cant let this be a war without end, and I cant lose the whole Democratic Party.\ Does that mean Obama really believes in the war, but his party doesnt? Or to White House aides: \This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan.\ So, if he wanted such a plan, he should have gotten such a plan. He is president after all. Which leads to the second problem: When a president is not clear about a tough problem, the military smells vacillations. And they sure dont like vacillation when it comes to dispatching their men and women to war. Americans dont fathom well the military mentality. The military in most countries throughout history doesnt like to go to war; they like to build up their arms and overall strength. But once in war, they want only more troops, fewer restrictions on their use, and above all, victory, victory, victory. Since Vietnam, they smell only vacillation among Democrats, and they dont like it. For their part, Democrats see insubordination and worse among the military toward them, and they dont care for the suits either. Its not a happy circumstance. Woodward didnt explore this underlying reality, which is critical for Americans to understand. breakAd The White House clash with the military could get worse over the latest news about Gen. Stanley McChrystals firing over naughty things said about the White House to a reporter. According to a preliminary Army investigation, the general—and perhaps even his senior Army aides—were not the sources of those nasty quotes. It was some other guys—you know, the usual culprits, the Navy and civilians. There will be further formal inquiries on this, but nothing good will come of them. Theres another important thread running throughout the Woodward account that, I believe, he gets more wrong than right. That is, Woodwards repeated insistence of open and bitter policy brawls in the good old Situation Room (the inner sanctum for White House meetings) over Afghan policy. Mr. Instant Historian paints a picture of a war of all against all. My information has always been that there was relative agreement on major policy. Based on my sources, there is no doubt that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Defense Secretary Bob Gates, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen were almost always quite cordial and in full lock step. They, along with the NSC Adviser Jim Jones and field commanders like General McChrystal and General Petraeus, are the key players. Of course, Vice President Joe Biden and Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel were the only regular critics of where policy was heading. The generals did lobby for their positions in public—in advance of presidential decisions. And thats a big no-no. But by that standard, almost all Obamas top advisers did as much. The day after his West Point speech last December, where he set the firm date of July 2011 to begin unspecified U.S. troop withdrawals, almost all the advisers publicly stated that maybe one didnt have to take this date too seriously, that everything was \conditions based.\ That group of rebels included Gates and Clinton. So, if anything, most of Obamas top counselors were more or less united—sometimes against where he seemed to be going. Here is what Petraeus had to say to Woodward on the subject of goals, and its a stunner: \You have to recognize also that I dont think you win this war. I think you keep fighting. Its a little bit like Iraq, actually.... Yes, there has been enormous progress in Iraq. But there are still horrific attacks in Iraq, and you have to stay vigilant. You have to stay after it. This is the kind of fight were in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids lives.\ The brilliant general said as much to others over the last year. Its enough to knock your socks off. So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever. Doubtless, President Obama does not want to fight an open-ended war. Hes sworn to that time and again, and I believe him, despite his history of calling for \victory\ and \defeat\ of the Taliban and al Qaeda. But what the Woodward book demonstrates is that Obama and his team just dont know how to get from here to there. So far, there are no heroes to this narrative, only self-described heroic skeptics of the war and warriors who would fight on forever. Leslie H.

I offer my deepest sympathies to the family, loved ones and colleagues of these victims. The safety and security of our personnel and their families in Mexico and at posts around the world is always our highest priority. I have spoken with our Ambassador in Mexico and we are working with the Government of Mexico to do everything necessary to protect our people and to ensure that the perpetrators of these horrendous acts are brought to justice. These appalling assaults on members of our own State Department family are, sadly, part of a growing tragedy besetting many communities in Mexico. They underscore the imperative of our continued commitment to work closely with the Government of President Calderon to cripple the influence of trafficking organizations at work in Mexico. This is a responsibility we must shoulder together, particularly in border communities where strong bonds of history, culture, and common interest bind the Mexican and the American people closely together.

C05766022	Cover story in the Economist this week. Very big issue when I was in Japan and Korea. Korean parliamentarians want to get women and economic growth on the G20 agenda when they have the lead next year and we are advocating for Japan to advance the issue at APEC which they are leading this year. On another note, so sad about Smith Bagley. He was a good person and was one of your biggest fans. Women and work We did it! Dec 30th 2009 From The Economist print edition The rich world's quiet revolution: women are gradually taking over the workplace Getty Images AT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate: within the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the majority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional workers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many of the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France. Women's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our times. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial jobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to abandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are running some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class citizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives. And millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to resist this trend—most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some southern European countries—will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent and frustrated citizens. This revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article). Men have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular advance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under- represented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest companies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid significantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and child-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have too little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children— particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money on child care. Dealing with the juggle These two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose between their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure companies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements. Motherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as much as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative poverty also disadvantages their children. Demand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if some of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior workers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex, including the \war for talent\ and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law firms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their \up or out\ promotion systems because they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in Germany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it easier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways. Women have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the European Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In America three out of four people thrown out of work since the \mancession\ began have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by 2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America. The light hand of the state All this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used threats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are women. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries. They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of the social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument, there is a way to speed up the revolution—and improve the tough lives of many working women and their children? If that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action programmes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is no. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and unfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a lower proportion of women in management than America does. But there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life easier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at home. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance, close at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer. These things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without going to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it spends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich country, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid maternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric about \real family values\. Still, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that women have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when America's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the image of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and \We Can Do It\ slogan, to encourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the workplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining glass ceilings.

Gary Sick has been arguing that it is in fact a military government. Of course this is predicate for targeted sanctions. There is a consistent thread in the challenges we face from a host of authoritarian (and totalitarian) military governments, sometimes loosely allied on an ad hoc basis--Iran, China, Myanmar, Venezuela, Cuba. This is nothing like the Cold War, but it's an idea worth exploring, not publicly discussing, but thinking about. On Justice Jim, a couple of thoughts: I wish his tragic end were as politically conclusive as that of Edmund Ruffin, the Southern fire-eater and secessionist who was given the honor of firing the first shot at Fort Sumter and upon hearing of Appomattox carefully sat himself down in his grand Charleston house and blew his brains out with a shotgun. Unfortunately, the evil Justice Jim did lives on--in the wild bigotry against Obama and even through the Supreme Court decision in the case of Citizens United, a group he helped galvanize to circulate the Whitewater hoax.

C05766928	Murtha back in the hospital By: David Rogers February 2,2010 10:43 AM EST Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha was back in the hospital Tuesday after undergoing gall bladder surgery last week. The Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington said that the 77-year-old Democrat was a patient in its intensive care unit but referred all questions about his condition to his family. Murtha's congressional office confirmed that he underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove his gallbladder at Bethesda Naval Hospital last week. But the congressman's spokesman refused comment on the seriousness of his condition or any complication that required hospitalization. A powerhouse in the House Appropriations Committee and close friend of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D- Calif.), Murtha was hospitalized for a period in December as well when he suffered an infection in his gall bladder. The doctors then decided that it should be removed once the infection had been tempered, and that set up the surgery last week at Bethesda. In the interim, Murtha has been back in the Capitol, and in his style, came back from the hospital— with IV bandages still on him— to oversee passage of his defense appropriations bill.

C05766082	I. Introduction The next six months will be a critical time for establishing the Department's leadership in bridging relationships for U.S. intergovernmental officials and their foreign counterparts, defining the mission and role of the Office of the Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs (\S/SRGIA\), and outlining an agenda that serves the needs of the Department and these officials. Our approach will be strategic and integrated, working in collaboration with Department bureaus and USAID offices to strengthen and deliver on the Secretary's and Administration's priorities. II. Key Objectives The Special Representative for Global Intergovernmental Affairs will serve the global needs of the U.S. intergovernmental officials and the entities they represent. The S/SRGIA will also connect U.S. state and local officials with intergovernmental officials around the world, promote local capacity building investments and programs to enhance country-led processes, and facilitate the needs and goals of intergovernmental officials here and abroad consistent with Department priorities. III. Next Steps This work plan describes activities that the S/SRGIA plans to initiate, grow and implement in the next six months. To place the Work Plan in context, we describe below S/SRGIA' s work-planning process. A. Establish S/SRGIA Mission and Role in the Department. Currently, no one and no office in the State Department has accountability to serve the needs of intergovernmental officials, (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected leaders, the entities that represent them) with respect to their global affairs portfolios. State and local officials' concerns are typically routed on an individual basis through bureaus with the results reflecting , the priority of the person in the bureau's estimation or the nature of the request. Priority activities will be as follows: 1 Sensitive But Unclassified • Confirm the Secretary's support to focus on priority issues and countries; • Join Department's meetings and conversations with visiting foreign state and local representatives and dignitaries to establish S/SRGIA's role; • Strengthen support on global intergovernmental affairs issues internally in the State Department, by explaining the value of these stakeholders; • Track deployment of resources assisting intergovernmental officials and leverage the State Department's collective U.S. and global intergovernmental relationships; • Follow and interpret international issues (e.g., food security, global health, climate change, trade and economic development, energy) of importance to state governments; • Promote dialogue between the Department (e.g., USAID, EEB, ECA, Public Private Partnerships, Global Women's Issues, Consular Affairs, MCC and targeted Regional Bureaus) and external constituents (e.g., Governors, Mayors, local elected officials, and the entities that they represent) for more effective partnerships and relationships; and • Collaborate with the Public Diplomacy and INR to create a survey of foreign intergovernmental affairs officials to determine their needs and engage U.S. intergovernmental officials to learn how the Department should help to further their global goals. B. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of U.S. intergovernmental officials. State economies are increasingly globalized, and more and more U.S. companies are competing in international markets and against firms worldwide. As the principal stewards of their states' economic success, Governors recognize that the global marketplace presents both challenges and opportunities and that states must address both to ensure their continued competitiveness. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in partnership with its participating US and other intergovernmental and international organizations. U.S. national organizations who serve governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following: • National Governors Association; • National Lt. Governors Association; • U.S. Conference of Mayors; • National League of Cities; • National Association of Counties/Large Urban County Caucus; • National Association of States Attorney Generals; • National State Legislatures; and • Councils of State Governments. Outreach is essential to many aspects of the Department's activities. S/SRGIA's outreach objective is to promote and increase the general awareness of the benefits of the State Department efforts in global intergovernmental affairs, especially among decision makers and policy makers, educational entities, non-governmental organizations, public-interest groups and public agencies. S/SRGIA will provide international outreach services to state and local elected officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all other inhabited U.S. territories. Specific objectives are to: 2 Sensitive But Unclassified • Build state by state profiles, thus creating a set of priorities and identifying opportunities for collaboration with state and local officials on their global projects and Department priorities; • Establish our target list of public officials to assist and nurture relationships with principals and the organizations that represent them and their global needs; • Create dialogue with the Governors and Mayors in preparation for the NGA and Mayors Washington conferences in the fall; • Travel to conferences and meetings within the United States and countries abroad required to implement the Department's global intergovernmental affairs agenda; • Develop a network of leaders, to collaborate and create partnerships; • Coordinate meetings between Department of State experts and state and local officials; • Support targeted elected officials trade missions and other official trips abroad; • Develop a strategy for deliverables such as multilateral pacts and Memorandum of Understandings on key State Department priorities that we will sign with responsible parties; and • Collaboration with EEB, to partner with them to engage state and local government leaders in the bureaus enhanced commercial diplomacy efforts (e.g. the Administration's National Export Initiative and EEB/Consular Affairs Business Visa Facilitation initiative, etc.). C. Conduct Stakeholder Outreach: Obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials. Currently, ECA conducts a significant number of exchanges with foreign and domestic government officials. None of ECA's programs target regions with the objective of enhancing another country's government systems because the bureau's authorities do not permit any type of training since everything must be done under the auspices of enhancing mutual understanding. The most visible ECA program is the International Visitor Leadership Program which in FY09 brought in 1,390 foreign government officials at the state, city and national levels to gain knowledge around the US political system and culture. To date, the bureau estimates the same number of government visitors in FY10. Thus, S/SRGIA will develop its global intergovernmental affairs outreach activities in partnership with international organizations. International organizations who serve local governmental authorities include but are not limited to the following: • United Cities and Local Governments; • Metropolis; • The World Urban Forum; • UN-HABITAT; • Latin American and Caribbean Ministers of Housing and Urbanization; • UN Advisory Committee of Local Authorities; • The World Mayors Council on Climate Change; 3 Sensitive But Unclassified • Sister Cities International; • Local Governments for Sustainability; and • Municipal Development Partnerships which targets governments in Africa. Priority activities will be as follows: • S/SRGIA will collaborate with Public Diplomacy to conduct stakeholder outreach with strategic countries — e.g. Af, Pak, Iraq — and key emerging powers (Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria) and developing countries (Rwanda, Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.) to obtain first-hand understanding of the needs of middle and senior foreign intergovernmental affairs officials; • Collaborate with [NR to assist us in gaining a better understanding of what foreign intergovernmental affairs officials want to engage with their US counterparts ranging from engagement on a host of common policy concerns, opportunities, programs and connections. D. Provide Leadership for Department Intergovernmental Capacity Building. One of our largest challenges in most developing countries is the lack of capacity in the government below the President and Prime Minister level. As the Department seeks to implement development programs or conduct diplomacy, there is often limited local counterpart capacity to do so with or to empower. S/SRGIA will work with USAID and State bureaus and offices to provide connections and leadership development to build the capacity of intergovernmental officials in countries around the world. Currently, millions of dollars of USAID and ECA grants that support capacity building are typically carried out by contractors and have results that are not transparent in their reporting or impact. S/SRGIA will partner with existing offices to provide leadership for the investment in this space, accountability for the outcomes and programming, and foster relationships between intergovernmental officials here in the US with foreign partners to mentor and model what is needed. S/SRGIA capacity building strategies will primarily be based on best practices derived from studying successful and less-successful approaches. Within the next six months, S/SRGIA will work in partnership with Department and USAID bureaus and resources. Priority activities will be as follows: • Identify State Department investments, canvass additional State Department dedicated resources other than grant-making and assess the strength of the current environment needed to advance the S/SRGIA's Secretary capacity building agenda for state and local leaders; participate in QDDR process regarding this agenda; • Develop an agenda for a high-level retreat on the formulation of a National Capacity Development Strategy to present achievements to date, lessons learned and proposals for institutional capacity development going forward; • Work with the Chiefs of Missions and other diplomats in countries where capacity building is critical to the success of our diplomacy and development efforts; 4 Sensitive But Unclassified • Amplify and sustain high quality and results driven support to institutional capacity development by assisting in advocating for increased funding and building public-private partnerships; • Prioritize discrete initiatives to \fast track\, based on importance, regional priorities (e.g., Asia, Africa and Latin America), assessment of readiness, impact and feasibility and translate priorities into actionable interventions; • Develop a network of experts involved in existing capacity-building initiatives related to global intergovernmental affairs and build partnerships; • Define a coordinated approach and institutional responsibilities for supporting the GIA capacity building initiative; and • Identify opportunities for further collaboration with state and local officials on their projects and Department priorities. IV. Administrative Activities • Standardize requests for assistance with projects related to policy, business, trade, consular affairs, etc.; and • Link the Department website to states websites and trade and development office websites. V. Budget and Staffing S/SRGIA will require a budget and staffing to fulfill its mission. VI. Assessment of Progress The short term goal will be to engage U.S. intergovernmental officials about their global concerns. The S/SRGIA office will become a significant resource for high-level State Department engagement for U.S. state and local elected officials. The benefits of this new office will be immediate and grow over time as our engagement deepens. Assisting US states and local governments to expand their exports, promote locations for foreign investment and for participation in State Department priorities are some of the short term benefits we hope to achieve with respect to U.S. intergovernmental officials. With respect to the global intergovernmental officials, in the short term, we expect to work with our Regional Bureaus and Offices, (e.g., USAID, ECA, EEB, etc.) to assess the current state of play and assist us with how we better target and leverage our assistance to this constituency. In the longer term, institutionally, we need to sustain relationships with our embassies and missions overseas, so that they can assist state and local officials and their constituencies to expand their global business base. As related to our national capacity building strategy, in the long term, we seek to empower and educate and build relationships with state and local officials abroad. We also seek accountability for the outcomes of the programming and will provide leadership for future investments. Going forward, we will tailor these investments to address regional State Department priorities. 5 Sensitive But Unclassified In addition, since there is a lack of USG harmonization of all of the relevant USG programs, having S/SRGIA be the designated coordinator will allow DOS to take the lead in synchronizing government wide programs that engage foreign government officials. This will be another long term goal for the office. VII. Potential Events A. Potential Events and Activities for S 1. Private Dinner or Luncheon with the Governors and Urban Mayors; 2. Roundtable or Speech at USCMNGA Winter Meetings; and 3. Recommendations of Governors and Mayors for S to extend possible invitations for occasional international travel with S. B. Potential Events and Activities SRGIA 1. Host \Day with State\ with U.S. intergovernmental officials and conduct joint meetings with various State Department Bureaus and Offices giving stakeholders the ability to connect and partner with State; 2. Focus Groups with Diplomats from key regions of interest representing Latin America, Africa, Asia in our development of our capacity building strategy; 3. Meetings with other elected officials and representative organizations; 4. Meetings with NG0s, thinktanks, etc.; and 5. Recommend US intergovernmental officials for appointments to US delegations to State Department international meetings and conferences. VIII. Possible Travel for SRGIA A. Domestic 1. TX, NY, VA, MD, PA, Delaware, D.C. Illinois, Florida, California, Ohio, NJ, Michigan. States are targeted based on foreign direct investment, export data and states of interest. B. International 1.

The awards are all serious and DVF is the moderator. Each awardee receives 50K for her ongoing work. The event bears no resemblance to a typical foreign policy event, but if you were in NY, you could arrive for the awards and leave.

I had multiple exchanges with Jackson over the course of the day yesterday. Based on your colloquy with Aboul-Gheit and Jeff s follow-up, we are quoted in the piece which you see in the clips as having a direct and spirited exchange with the Egyptians and that there was no misunderstanding of the importance that we attach to these issues. So in the end Jackson grants some credit for the discussion, and we agree to disagree on the degree to which this discussion should be public. PJ SBU This email is UNCLASSIFIED.
C05771629	Talks.doc I have not been able to get a psychology dinner set up, but I have found the article that you read on the difference an apology can make in the Middle East (coming in next email) and commissioned a useful paper from Louise Diamond, an expert on psychology and negotiations who has done a lot of work between the Israels and the Palestinians herself (attached). It's about 5 pages; I really think it is worth a read. Finally, on changing the frame to look forward, I strongly recommend that you spend 8 minutes to look at a video produced by a Rand study called The Arc, which proposes a high-speed road/rail project connecting the key cities in the West Bank and Gaza. It is a powerful, powerful vision of what could be, one that will play right into Bibi's emphasis on economic growth. For my money, it would be worth a private 8 minutes screening.

Sanger has a blog item on the NYT site about the comment, but more of a political take in that if you run for president again your opponents will pull the Brookings tape. And a couple of wingnut blogs asking why you don't just volunteer more of your own money to taxes, and that you chose Brazil as a \socialist country that sides with our enemies as a model.\. But frankly, I had to look pretty hard to find that, I was the 19th person to read it. Not 19,000th. 19th. Most coverage was either straightforward about the NSS, or your comments about the debt as a national security problem.

C05771883	Cc: Samuel Berger Saturday, August 28, 2010 5:30 PM H Samuel Berger Principles_Design_Working Draft.pdf; Principles_Design_Working Draft.pdf HRC: I am attaching a matrix of prior language that has been used in connection with the major Israeli-Palestinian issues. It was prepared in the context of language the US might use if it were to articulate principles, not principles to which the parties might agree, but it provides most of the language that has been used in the past, with citations. The USIP Middle East group Steve and I chair decided that rather than issue a static report, we would prepare/commission a series of timely and specific papers that we would provide privately to the Administration. (I have sent some of those to your office). They include papers on security, Palestinian institution building, public attitudes in Israel and the territories, etc. I will deliver a set of those papers to your office on Monday If it would be useful, I would be happy to convene a small, private discussion with some of the sharpest people in the group, or give you some names. A few observations following up our call this am.: (1) This (a Framework Agreement) is very difficult but I don't think impossible. If Bibi can say he has secured unprecedented commitments on security and established the principle of a Jewish state, he could decide to play the historic leader. If he is uncompromising, he will have to deal with the consequences for US-Israeli relations. His opt out, of course, is to blame the Pais, but we will be \in the room\. (2) I think this should be a negotiation that goes from principle to paper rather than the other way around, i.e. not an early exchange of documents that dig each side into its positions. The two leaders need to feel each other out first at the level of first principles, to be distilled after a period by the U.S. (3) Not sure we need to be in every meeting.. Ultimately, they need to establish some trust. But we (you or Mitchell) need to be present enough to make sure that there is no misunderstanding of what has been agreed, and to move things along. . (4) On the critical issue of security, I don't think the Israelis any more trust NATO to stand firm. They will expect an IDF presence in the Jordan Valley for some time. Palestinians recognize that there will be a transitional phase. Question is how long. (5) As you know, Abbas' position is crumbling. Based on my conversation with him when he was here recently, I think he is genuinely committed to an agreement. He hopes that, if this fails, Bibi will seem to be unreasonable. And in that event, I expect he will resign. His minimal requirement is the equivalent of 1967. This is all tricky business, but I don't think we have a responsible choice not to make this effort. It is the highest form of statesmanship for you to try. I am leaving on Monday for some foreign travel but can be reached through my office -- Laura Huber Sandy

C05759611	What should we do about this?
C05767490	The Secretary's Phone Call with Egyptian President Mubarak Background: S/E Mitchell met with Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Omar Solimon on January 24 in Cairo. While Solimon responded positively to S/E Mitchell's request that Egypt encourage Palestinian President Abbas to agree to proximity talks, Aboul Gheit asserted that the Palestinians should not agree to any form of negotiations until Israel has taken action on the \five steps\ requested by the Palestinians. Aboul Gheit then hosted a meeting on February 3 with Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Jordanian FM Nasser Judeh, which Solimon attended in part. Egypt and Jordan agreed to support the Palestinians entry into proximity talks, but the three sides also agreed that Abbas would seek U.S. views on two questions: 1) The terms of reference for the proximity talks and 2) Whether the U.S. would present its own bridging proposals on final status issues or simply serve as a conduit for the parties' positions. Deputy Envoy David Hale met with Abbas on February 5, during which Abbas indicated flexibility on both the terms of reference (he would accept a general formula based on language from the Roadmap) and on the U.S. role. You should emphasize that it is critical that Abbas agree to begin proximity talks immediately to lay the foundation for negotiations that will realize Palestinian aspirations for an independent and viable state.

C05771747	Please Pass to the Secretary Madame Secretary, A shoot out occurred on August 20 in front of the American School in Monterrey (AFSM), resulting in the death of two bodyguards. An investigation is continuing into the details, but our understanding at this point is that it was an attempted kidnapping targeting the relatives of a local business executive. While it does not appear that U.S. families were targeted, the sharp increase in kidnapping incidents in the Monterrey area, and this event in particular, present a very high risk to the families of U.S. citizens who might be become incidental victims. U.S. security and law enforcement personnel have engaged local and federal security officials to seek their help on understanding the immediate risks and measures that can be taken. I have urged U.S. families at the Consulate in Monterrey not to send their children to school in the coming days while we review the events that took place on August 20. We also are advising U.S. citizens in the area that we have urged Consulate personnel not to send their children to school while we complete this security review. I am sure that the warden notice will lead to a rash of press reports on U.S. concerns about security in Monterrey. More broadly, if the government cannot get the kidnappings in Monterrey under control, that may affect our ability to function in Monterrey. I have advised Secretary Espinosa of this, and have sought her help as well to address consulate security. Consulate personnel are currently on \authorized departure\ and have the option to send their families to a U.S. location. Pat Kennedy is in close touch on these matters. Carlos Pascual
C05770538	Thank you for all you did on behalf of the Afghan women on your whirlwind visit. Emails of gratitude to you are pouring in from Afghanistan. Many of the women listened to your intervention and commented on that as well as your small meeting. Yesterday, I had to speak at an event with the Congressional Women's Caucus on Maternal Health in Afghanistan. I said that as we were meeting in the Cannon Caucus Room , you were making a major maternal health announcement in Afghanistan. The women Members were overjoyed as were all the health advocates. This article from the Guardian was sent to me by a UK parliamentarian who intends to echo your remarks. Also, Andrea Mitchell did a great piece on your meeting with the women on NBC. > Hillary Clinton vows to defend rights of Afghan women > US secretary of state tells foreign ministers meeting in Kabul women 'will not be sacrificed' in any peace deal with the Taliban > Jon Boone in Kabul > Wednesday July 21 2010 > The Guardian > http://mvw.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/20/hillary-clinton-afghan-women-taliban > Jon Boone > Hillary Clinton today promised that any peace deal with the ultra-conservative Taliban movement would not come at the cost of the rights of Afghan women. > The US secretary of state told a conference of the world's foreign ministers that women in the country \will not be sacrificed\ and announced a number of initiatives to improve their situation. > Her intervention came when many diplomats assume that any deal with hardline insurgents will inevitably involve compromises that would have been unthinkable nine years ago, when the US-led invasion of Afghanistan was in part justified by the desire to emancipate Afghan women. > But in a meeting with leading Afghan women today Clinton told them that any deal \cant come at the cost of women and womens lives\. > \We are aware of the concerns that many of you have expressed about the reconciliation process and we understand why you would have those concerns,\ Clinton told them. > Anxious to put the issue on the agenda of her fellow foreign ministers, she told the conference that women and civil society groups \will be essential to this countrys success.\ > \If these groups are fully empowered to help build a just and lasting peace, they will help do so,\ she said. \If they are silenced and pushed to the margins of Afghan society, the prospects for peace and justice will be subverted.\ > She also announced extra US funding for projects to improve maternal and child health, including one scheme that will use mullahs to encourage women to make use of clinics. In rural Afghan society, where they are often not allowed to leave the house without their husbands permission, women are sometimes discouraged from seeking medical care. > The final conference communique recognised \the centrality of women's rights to the future of Afghanistan\. > Earlier this month, a report by Human Rights Watch said the Afghan government was already doing little to protect women and that their rights should be a priority in any political agreement with the Taliban. > The organisation said in areas under the control of militants, women suffer from violence and intimidation while girls schools and female activists are attacked. The report identified one case where a female civil servant had to quit her job after receiving a \night letter\ from insurgents threatening to kill her. > If you have any questions about this email, please contact the guardian.co.uk user help desk: userhelpguardian.co.uk.

C05768176	Wow, that was fast - and great Dont worry about the reporter reading the quotes back to you, were recording and hell have the transcript shortly. Im guessing we just caught him at a bad moment and hes not as flaky as he sounds
C05763949	Whenever you do something big on TV we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great. But this time is noticeably different. First, people across the spectrum - DC insiders, reporters, staff, ex-staff, friends of friends, WH folks, etc - were blown away. Second, people were REALLY moved by the last segment, three people even told me they teared up. Im guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days. And I think because its been a lousy couple of weeks for the Admin, with mixed messages and bad news, coupled with many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the President, and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in Denver that youre in a class all your own (including the President who became enmeshed in the Gates incident) That you didnt wait for the envoy question was key, you turned it into a strength. What you said about the President and how you said it, one cant help but think how much of a team player you are and how remarkably youve adapted to the role. You were definitely on your game. You either threw a perfect game - or at least a no hitter. So this couldnt have gone better, achieved everything we needed to times 10, and comes on the heels of a great 10 days. Will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this. Because there was no substantive news, itll be a focus on style especially saving Biden.

C05770409	One thing I forgot to mention - Bill B and Mike Posner recommend that you release the below statement. Apparently Hamidis execution is imminent. With your approval well put out. DRAFT STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON Urging Iran to Respect the Fundamental Freedoms of its Citizens The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights, as well as to intimidate and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and who stand up for the rights of their fellow citizens. We remain troubled by the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who garnered international attention for her verdict of death by stoning. While the Iranian government later stated she would not face execution by stoning, her fate has been left unclear. We are also troubled by reports that Ebrahim Hamidi, an 18-year old charged with homosexuality, faces imminent execution despite the fact that he is currently without legal representation. Neither of their cases have proceeded with the transparency or due process enshrined in Irans own constitution and their lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, felt that he had no other choice than to flee Iran after he had been questioned by authorities and his family members had been detained. We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to free expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lan. The United States urges the Iranian government to halt these executions in accordance with its international obligations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners and imprisoned human rights defenders. The United States will continue to stand with people all around the world who seek to exercise their universal rights and to speak out in defense of human liberties.

C05770760	FYI George Richert May 25, 2010 6:00 p.m. A new Buffalo Bill is catching the worlds attention. On the practice field Tuesday afternoon, he was just another Bill, a rookie no less, but hes catching a lot of attention in his familys homeland. In China this week, during a speech to dignitaries at the USA Pavilion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said this: \From Yo-Yo Ma to I.M. Pei to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Chu, Chinese-Americans have achieved great success in business, government, the arts, sciences and sports. And to that end, I was pleased to hear that the Buffalo Bills have recently drafted the first Chinese-American to play in the NFL,\ said Clinton. Buffalo Bills offensive tackle Ed Wang said, \It felt good. Shes a very important person, and so for someone like that to talk about me, it just feels good.\ Wang didn't know until he heard from News 4 that he was mentioned in Shanghai. The 6'5\, 250 pound Bills rookie wasnt born in China, but both of his parents were Chinese Olympians in track and field, so he loves breaking new ground in football. >»In Georges reporters notebook, he explains why the Buffalo Bills limit media access to the first 15 minutes of practice \It is important to me just because I am the first, and I take a lot of pride in being Chinese, but at the same time, I know that Im out here to play football,\ said Wang. Wang is expected to make the team, and his goal is to make a difference.

A few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite props: a pipe clenched between his teeth. \Ive got my pipe,\ he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the stem, \because were going to speak about schoolish kind of things.\ The theme of the day was \Restoring History,\ and Beck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of history textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by \malicious progressive intent.\ Progressives, he explained—liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left—\knew they had to separate us from our history to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God.\ For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the history that \is being stolen from us\: the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the nation from the \near-depression\ of 1946—crises that progressives don't want you to know about. \Youve been taught one lie, I think, your whole life,\ he said. For the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck—a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon convert—has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by Democracy Corps, showed that he is \the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,\ seen not merely as an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an \educator.\ And in the past few months Beck has established his own institute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with \revisionists and secular progressives\ about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist federal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the division of powers. During the \Restoring History\ episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear \lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find.\ The B.U. faculty consists of three members, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at Louisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders, which the Web site calls \a national pro-family organization.\ Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one, on his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons about the countrys long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the early twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and the graduated federal income tax came into existence. \Wilson,\ Beck told his radio audience in August, \just despised what America was.\ Becks claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movements Freedom Summit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, \The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill.\ And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from Cape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the groups Web site that \the very things you see happening in this country today started with the Wilson Administration.\ At a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as \an unfettered new force of the middle class.\ And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is audacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement—or, at least, a new twist in the nations long history of conspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago, especially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers. Becks version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W. Cleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Societys founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is, of course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers politics and their view of American history—which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist China—has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades inside the Republican Party have exploded anew—and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to challenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them. The early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist violence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time deliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called \massive resistance\ to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which claimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a fearsome Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he resigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedys Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom Thurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly liberal domestic programs \fall clearly within the category of socialism.\ The John Birch Society was one of the decades most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert Welch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military- intelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the Cold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthys fall, in 1954, many of McCarthys followers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his societys membership was estimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an \immense\ domestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists clutches. In a tract titled \The Politician,\ he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as \a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy\ who had been serving the plot \all of his adult life.\ Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he accused the Kennedy Administration of \helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the opposite.\ Wherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of totalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik Revolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as \always and inevitably an enemy of individual freedom.\ Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal governments role in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson \more than any other one man started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.\ In the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but \a tool of the total conspiracy.\ This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth century, in the \uniformly Satanic creed and program\ of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called \the Insiders,\ the conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government agencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they had done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. \One broad avenue down which these conspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,\ Welch declared in 1966. \The very same collectivist theories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new and modern concepts.\ In the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a nonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the Marxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the populace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. \It isn't numbers we have to worry about,\ Welch wrote, \but the courage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough—the same as the Communists do.\ The \Founder\ himself would dictate the societys policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and professionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. \It is the leadership that is most demanding, most exacting of its followers,\ Welch observed, \that achieves really dedicated support.\ Welchs group became synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly to the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a humorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states. Still, the most outlandish of the eras right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A transplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early nineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoovers F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted that \during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who are promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes.\ Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I., from 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed implausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he had served as Hoovers administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position. Skousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from 1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card game attended by the citys right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen \a master of half truths\ and said that he ran the police department \like a Gestapo\; Skousens supporters placed burning crosses on the Mayors lawn. After losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an exemplar of the far-right \ultras.\ Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion Speakers Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled \The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,\ which condemned the societys critics for \promoting the official Communist Party line.\ (This was a tic of Skousens; he later defended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called \The Communist Attack on the Mormons.\) All along, Skousens evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welchs. In \The Naked Communist,\ a lengthy primer published in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.s adviser Harry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first Sputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condons novel \The Manchurian Candidate\ appeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating \a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters.\ A later book, \The Naked Capitalist,\ decried the Ivy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller Foundation, formed \the worlds secret power structure.\ The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like the wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the Federal Reserve and the graduated income tax. In 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for Constitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets included \the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Communication Commissions fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal governments change of the gold standard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social security, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.\ Skousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing fringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had \gone off the deep end.\ In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of \inventing fantastic ideas and making inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,\ and advancing doctrines that came \perilously close\ to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President.Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his organizations. Skousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced \The 5,000 Year Leap,\ a treatise that assembles selective quotations and groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that the framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often described as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander Hamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. \The 5,000 Year Leap\ is not a fervid book. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of what Samuel Adams, in 1768, called \the Utopian schemes of leveling,\ which Skousen equates with redistribution of wealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas Jefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy, which meant that \the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made a paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.\ Skousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that \the Founders were not indulging in any idle gesture when they adopted the motto In God We Trust. \In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional Convention was \E Pluribus Unum\: out of many, one. \In God We Trust\ came much later; its use on coins was first permitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency. The following year, President Eisenhower—who Welch charged was a Communist agent—approved \In God We Trust\ as the national motto. In 1982, Skousen published a follow-up work, an ancestor-worshipping history text titled The Making of America,\ and prepared a study guide for nationwide seminars based on its contents. As Alexander Zaitchik reports in his informative study of Beck, \Common Nonsense,\ the new book became an object of controversy in 1987, after the California Bicentennial Commission sold it as part of a fund-raising drive. Among its offenses was an account of slavery drawn from long-disgraced work by the historian Fred A. Shannon, which characterized slave children as \pickaninnies\ and suggested that the worst victims of slavery were the slaveholders themselves. The constitutional scholar Jack Rakove, of Stanford, inspected Skousens book and seminars and pronounced them \a joke that no self-respecting scholar would think is worth a warm pitcher of spit.\ By the time Skousen died, in 2006, he was little remembered outside the ranks of the furthest-right Mormons. Then, in 2009, Glenn Beck began touting his work: \The Naked Communist,\ \The Naked Capitalist,\ and, especially, \The 5,000 Year Leap,\ which he called \essential to understanding why our Founders built this Republic the way they did.\ After Beck put the book in the first spot on his required-reading list—and wrote an enthusiastic new introduction for its reissue— it shot to the top of the Amazon best-seller list. In the first half of 2009, it sold more than two hundred and fifty thousand copies. Local branches of the Tea Party Patriots, the United American Tea Party, and other groups across the country have since organized study groups around it. \It is time we learn and follow the FREEDOM principles of our Founding Fathers,\ a United American Tea Party video declares, referring to the principles expounded by Skousens book. If Beck is the movements teacher, \The 5,000 Year Leap\ has become its primer, with \The Making of America\ as a kind of 102- level text. The popularity of Becks broadcasts, which now reach two million viewers each day, has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of. Several times a week, Beck informs his audience that socialists (whom he also sometimes calls Fascists or Communists) led by Obama have seized power, and that patriotic Americans must take their country back. His TV show for some time featured \Comrade Updates,\ in which Beck described perfidy while the Soviet anthem played in the background. He attacks all the familiar bogeymen: the Federal Reserve System (which he asserts is a private conglomerate, unaccountable to the public); the Council on Foreign Relations (born of a \progressive idea\ to manipulate the media in order to \let the masses know what should be done\); and a historical procession of evildoers, including Skousens old target Colonel House and Welchs old target Woodrow Wilson. His sources on these matters, quite apart from Skousens books, can be unreliable. On September 22nd, amid a diatribe about House, Beck cited a passage from \Secrets of the Federal Reserve,\ by Eustace Mullins. The book, commissioned in 1948 by Ezra Pound, is a startlingly anti-Semitic fantasy of how a Jewish-led conspiracy of all-powerful bankers established the Federal Reserve in service of their plot to dominate the world. Part of Becks allure is the promise that he will reveal secret information. In one segment last year, he produced a drawing of fasces—which he described, anachronistically, as \the Roman symbol of Fascism\—and then a picture of an old Mercury dime, with fasces on the reverse side. \Who brought this dime in? It happened in 1916—Woodrow Wilson was the President,\ he said. \We've been on the road to Fascism for a while.\ Benito Mussolini, of course, didnt adopt the ancient symbol of authority as the Fascist emblem until the nineteen-twenties; the designer of the coin, the sculptor Adolph A. Weinman, intended it to signify the nations military preparedness, and paired it with an olive branch to illustrate the desire for peace. Becks readings of Progressive-era politics are nearly as bizarre. Whatever can be said about Theodore Roosevelt, he was not a crypto-radical. It was Roosevelt who coined the term \lunatic fringe\ to describe the extreme leftists of his day, and his concept of New Nationalism—in which an activist government built a vibrant capitalism, partly by regulating big business—looked back to Alexander Hamilton, not Karl Marx. Nor was Wilson a Bolshevik; in fact, in 1917 he sent American troops to Russia to support the anti-Bolshevik White Army. At home, his reforms sought to break up monopolies in order to restore competition among small companies. \If America is not to have free enterprise,\ Wilson declared, \then she can have no freedom of any sort whatever.\ In 2007, Beck, then the host of \Glenn Beck,\ on CNNs Headline News, brought to his show a John Birch Society spokesman named Sam Antonio, who warned of a government plot to abolish U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, \and eventually all throughout the Americas.\ Beck told Antonio, \When I was growing up, the John Birch Society—I thought they were a bunch of nuts.\ But now, he said, \you guys are starting to make more and more sense to me.\ His guest beamed. \Yes, we at the John Birch Society are not nuts,\ Antonio said. \We are just exposing the truth that's been out there for many, many years.\ Since then, the Birch Societys Web site has run clips from Becks Fox broadcasts, proudly pointing out similarities with their own ideas. Last June, an essay on the site described a presentation by Beck on Communism in America as \the ultimate in complete agreement between the Beck and JBS presentations of American history.\ Beck has also praised Ezra Taft Benson, one of Skousens close associates. Benson, the Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower and the thirteenth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, gained notoriety for a speech in 1966 in which he denounced Democratic officeholders and intellectuals (including the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.) as socialists and Communist sympathizers, warned that \the Constitution will be endangered and hang, as it were, by a single thread,\ and praised the John Birch Society as \the most effective non-church organization in our fight against creeping socialism and Godless Communism.\ Last June, Beck aired a clip from another Benson speech, intoning, \Ezra Taft Benson warned about what was coming.\ The Birch Societys Web site subsequently praised Beck for \getting progressively (sorry for the bad word choice) closer to presenting American history in the way that The John Birch Society has been doing it for over 50 years.\ Beck is no more the sole representative of todays multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen- sixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was \not involved with the Tea Party.\ Why, then, have the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative Republicans—not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a \freedom conference\ in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John Birch Society and Skousens old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as \mainstream America\ and patriots who had \heard the call.\) The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested that the election of a black President sowed \fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in the country.\ There are signs that this is so: Republicans singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an \activist Justice\ during Elena Kagans Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the minuscule New Black Panther Party. But \socialist\ is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal Reserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Partys fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big government generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obamas skin. The current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half century. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in November, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those \discordant voices of extremism\ that \equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with Communism.\ But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as paranoids and conspiracy-mongers. The leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor of National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph McCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was set by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical conservatives their chance at national power. \By 1961,\ his biographer John B. Judis writes, \Buckley was beginning to worry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even Fascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted.\ In the next two decades, with Buckleys support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that succeeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power. As confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be expected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their fellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckleys colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch Society went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the conservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of \distorting reality\ and failing to make \the crucial moral and political distinction\ between Communists and liberals, the magazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support. By 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and he consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged Goldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing \kooks\ lurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some \nice guys,\ and that it would be injudicious to attack the group in public. The Birchers support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in 1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: \Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. . . . Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\ In the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats succeeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan \In Your Heart, You Know Hes Right,\ the Democrats shot back, \In Your Guts, You Know Hes Nuts.\) Buckleys fears had been confirmed. But he was undeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon among a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagans politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently been elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy- washy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York. Nixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had established himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official at the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. \It seems to me that we ought to have a real chance of winning this year,\ Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National Convention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge of Nixons media operations. But Buckleys candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of the editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P. nomination in 1960, didnt sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom Welch had called one of \the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene.\ As President, in 1969, Nixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious appeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place later that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the countrys anxieties over Vietnam, Buckley and the mainstream of what he called \responsible conservatism\ returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives were left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch Society. Nixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The conservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixons second term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixons campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats internal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had \an indifference toward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom.\ Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read the Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican Party and in national politics. In 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagans primary challenge to Nixons successor, Gerald Ford. After two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a shrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford, demonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of Orange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His pragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the relatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision dismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican moderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right- winger. Nobody was more pleased by Bushs selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who understood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had. As President, Reagan flattered the extremists—he even delivered some admiring words about Skousens Freemen Institute—but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style government, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He appointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bushs close associate, his first chief of staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy adviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and Bakers deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights legislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan skillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail Gorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed forward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillipss phrase, \a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda.\ Whatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the federal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the standpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to matching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline, and it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of extremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies—not least when, in the face of fiscal calamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of attacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to check some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even though polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first to have a bit of Reagans conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for his moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial collapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a conservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that \urbane visionaries and builders of institutions\ such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures \who make their money by stirring fears and resentments.\ Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, \has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,\ and is now ruled by those he called \the crazy-cons.\ Some Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the Republicans obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the congressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bushs financial bailout, lost a vicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the campaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had bought them at birth. \And then, of course,\ he recalls, \it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the Bilderbergers and all that stuff.\ Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox News the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine ODonnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were \nutty.\ Instantly, criticism came from Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself \a huge Tea Party fan,\ endorsing ODonnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give her its full backing. So far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as Buckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P. stalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates; Grist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the Republicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan. Fifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far rights \counsels of fear and suspicion.\ Today, Obamas White House is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the left, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like ODonnell may prove too eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of government. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as \a massive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party.\ (Already, Rove and some leading Bush political operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly supplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this years candidates.) But, according to a recent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a Republican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the coming midterm elections. In 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunnes fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social and political tumult of the day into perspective. \Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,\ Dooley remarked. \It's on'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet.\ A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the same about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a degree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For defenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. • Read more http://www.newyorker.com/reportinq/2010/10/18/101018fa fact wilentz?printable=true
C05769121	As I mentioned last week, I was on a panel at the Brussels forum with Lady Ashton (who insisted everyone call her Cathy), Estonian president Toomas lives, and Senator Voinovich. Ashton and I essentially reinforced each other at every turn and presented a very positive vision of US-EU partnership. She has scored some significant victories lately, most notably that development will be included in the European Action Service (EAS) rather than sitting at a separate desk (the formula we are seeking rather than the DFID formula). EU defense staff will also be included in the EAS. Indeed, Ashton chairs the European Council whenever the 27 foreign ministers, development ministers, or defense ministers meet -- the ultimate integrated frame. She also has control over a number of the smaller development and state- building budgets, though I gather the biggest development fund is still in dispute between her and the development commissioner. Apparently, however, the enlargement commissioner took his cues from her on strategy and policy and then presented his implementation plans to the Council, which is the role she wants. We should be able to build on the way the EU is organizing in pushing pushing our own integrated frame here. I hope everything goes well on Ottawa and NY. Bob Hormats and I will send a note on other aspects of Brussels forum, where US was well represented. AM

C05769739	Welcome back to an unbelievable snowy mess in DC! I wanted to tell you that I met with the Lithuanian official who is heading up the Community of Democracies. Lithuania has the lead for the next two years. They are extremely energetic and recognize that CD needs to be reinvigorated. It was not given much leadership from us during the Bush years and besides democracy got a bad name — among other reasons. Their plan is to create a few working groups focused on issues that are current and important with specific practical goals and tangible results — among them, one will be focused on women and their critical role. As you know, they have a female president, the EU has just established a Gender Institute in Vilnius and they remember Vital Voices when you headed up the conference in Iceland and the successor conference which was held in Lithuania in 2001. We talked about a more concerted commitment -- to advocating for women and the role they need to play in conflict resolution (1325), helping women in Afghanistan and working to help women in eastern Europe and the Caucuses where things appear to be going backwards in many ways (takes me back to our first-ever VV conference in Vienna). I agreed that we would co-chair the gender working group with Lithuania. The Lithuanians believe that in many ways the younger generation takes for granted what the older generation fought for (they remember being a \Captive Nation and how the US kept them going with an embassy when they was little likelihood at the time that theyd ever become a democracy), and that today democracies are struggling in too many places. Its as though we have to take back democracys good name and focus it as a universal value to address the critical challenges. Mike Posner has the lead on CD. I talked to him about all of this. He is all for our doing the gender working group as something tangible. He is concerned about where the Community of Democracies goes more broadly. Since this was a creation of the Clinton Administration and since democracy is under siege in so many places, I hope we will find a way to work with the Lithuanians and others who still want to see it make a difference. In some ways it may be more relevant today. They are planning the first ministerial in Krakow in July and hoping so much that you will be a part of it. Assuming I can get there, Im going to their embassy in the morning where several government reps of participating countries will be meeting to announce next steps, including the gender working group.

C05769875	Our clips service doesnt have the license necessary to provide FT (or Reuters) content, so heres the long awaited FT profile -youll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote: An FT interview with Hillary Clinton By Daniel Dombey FT June 11 2010 22:21 This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journeys end; the spotlight that has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most exciting for a generation - had never ended. But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clintons convoy is snaking through Sao Paulo, Brazil, not South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of US leadership, one very much built around herself. Shes had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but shes still greeted by a wave of raised arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones. In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage. Most US secretaries of state wouldnt bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip - and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a quarter of a million miles since taking office. On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we dont leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day. So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week, talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out. \We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister or the foreign minister or an ambassador,\ she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. \People now have a voice and an opinion and a vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.\ She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the USs image in the wake of the Bush administration - by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role - and ambitions - go beyond that. Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? \Well, I think that is part of the job,\ she replies, toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. \If you are making a case for American values and for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.\ As in Sao Paulo, her system is under strain - \Ive been fighting this all day,\ she says as she masks a cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as \oh my gosh\, even as she discusses issues of state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it. \He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - its chunky! I dont know how else to describe it,\ she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word \chunky\. Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way - a world away from the clipped, on-message manner of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying from a room. Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state, and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who served as secretary almost a century ago. \Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential stature, has set her apart,\ Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. \Leaders want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.\ State visitor Hillary Clinton is greeted by Air Force Base Commander Colonel Celso de Araujo at S'ao Paulo airport in March Back in Sao Paulo, the meeting at the university ranges far from the confines and dramatis personae of traditional diplomacy. Annie, a young woman with red and blue dreadlocked hair, tells Clinton about her dance and percussion classes and asks how to study in the US without paying college fees. A nervous young man confesses himself lost halfway through an abstruse question about tariff policy; Clinton, smiling and nodding in that vaguely automatic way of hers, bears with him all the same. Another female student asks for an autograph. When answering, Clinton sometimes opens her eyes wide as she emphasises a phrase; at other moments, seemingly at random, she pulls her hands apart as if demonstrating the size of a fish. Then a law student called Marina asks about abortion - which is illegal in Brazil - and Clinton moves into treacherous terrain. She speaks of the Brazilian hospital she visited in the 1990s that treated not just expectant mothers but women suffering from the consequences of backstreet abortions. \Wealthy women have rights in every country,\ she says. \And poor women dont.\ Her strength of feeling cant be hidden as she denounces \the great toll that illegal abortions take and the denial of women being able to exercise such a fundamental personal right\. Tom Shannon, the US ambassador to Brazil, tells me later: \I understand the possible concern that we might have come close to domestic issues. But she wasn't laying out a prescription for Brazil. She was sharing her experience as a woman in American politics and as secretary of state.\ Its true: Clinton doesnt quite cross the line. Onstage, she is controlled without seeming artificial, convivial without appearing over-effusive, what a previous age would call a real trouper. At the podium she looks straight ahead, her lips carefully expressionless. Still, the old competitive instincts havent left her. Perhaps it is the lecterns at press conferences, reminiscent of the Democratic presidential debates, but on exiting the podium at a joint appearance with Argentinas president Cristina Fernandez, Clinton makes clear her satisfaction at having had the last word. The expert debater who usually bested Obama has not left the stage. Yet that competitive urge coexists with what one insider describes as her \almost inhuman loyalty\ towards Obama. Her mastery of the facts - an \information carnivore\ one of her officials calls her - comes despite the consensus in much of Washington that her role consists largely of implementing the foreign policy Obama and his inner circle have framed, rather than helping frame it herself. In Sao Paulo, she shows her loyalty in striking fashion when she is asked repeatedly about positive discrimination - another sensitive topic in Brazil - not least because, Clinton herself observes, Afro- Brazilians account for more than half the countrys population but only 2 per cent of university students. \That suggests to me that some special steps need to be taken [in] recruiting and admitting students so that they can have a chance to succeed,\ she tells the hall, again inching towards domestic politics, before speaking of her pride in the progress the US civil rights movement has made in the past half-century. She says: \The election of Barack Obama, many believe, was the greatest accomplishment of all because it demonstrated that an African-American could be elected president of the United States.\ Among the crowd, I catch my breath and scribble down her words. Its hard to think of a more fulsome statement from the woman who fought so hard against Obama - and who squandered a huge poll lead and millions of dollars in the struggle against him. The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama administration When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne \that's politics\. She adds: \We're working really hard and well together ... It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to me.\ Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. \I always run inclusive and successful organisations,\ she retorts when I ask her whether shed applied any lessons from that searing experience to her new post. She admits she didnt want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the Senate -. \but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't.\ Also, she adds: \Suppose I had won and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.\ Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than before. \Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised that,\ says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. \The relationship is based on her performance in the job.\ By all accounts, its a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind - or with the rest of the administration - as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both. In truth, Clintons language remains harder-edged than Obamas - she recently claimed that Irans Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup - and she has sometimes been more willing than he is to hint at using the military. \She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,\ says Kurt Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush. She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan - apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama. Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill Clinton gives her strategic advice. \One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a kind of baseball saying,\ she says: \Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines but the trend lines.\ It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office, she replies \the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying and solving problems.\ A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine. But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades, when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a smart decision - by all accounts shes overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had towards her. \Its fair to say that she was not born into the administrations inner circle but slowly but surely, for the most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,\ says one official. Praising what he calls her \Terminator-quality durability and determination,\ he adds: \Shes done an amazing amount of work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.\ Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the meeting in So Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her campaign claims of expertise in the field. \It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around all of these issues,\ she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, \you may be in a different city four times a day but you have a message youre trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries problems, six different regional or global challenges in the course of a day.\ As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa - and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says the push is working, hailing a \change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the US\ - a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies. During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to her cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces \an Iran that runs to Brazil\ as well as other countries such as Turkey and China \telling different things to different people to avoid international sanctions\. Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. \Of course, I dont agree with everything the Secretary said,\ he says. It is not a happy experience - indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clintons biographers described his approach to government as a \permanent campaign\, and it appears to be his wifes preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clintons life, it is that she never throws in her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service. \Never, never!\ she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. \I have a very realistic sense of what high- stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the arena ... but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding, but you can't take it personally.\ Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. Shes been listening to coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders wives. \Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,\ she says. Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from Sao Paulo to Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job - as in her many other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. \I feel passionately it is in not just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and the tools to make the most out of their own lives,\ she says. In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she says, \I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job.\ \It's all baloney,\ says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is sitting to one side in her office. \Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,\ Clinton responds. I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: \I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.\ \Any chance it would be you?\ I ask. \No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,\ Clinton says. Shes given more categoric denials in the past. \I think that theres a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and thats just a fact.\ But, says one US official, \all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? Shes already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: Whats the idea behind raising her domestic profile still further?\ Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections. Back in Sao Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton, long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever. Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: \Hillary is a rock star ... she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour\ It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense - probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is essential and a commitment to multilateralism - in fact multi, multilateralism using different and overlapping forums - is real and right. You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me. That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself as well as at others. She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's essential to take part. There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague. David Miliband is shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: \Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly close\ A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven. Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which limited his ability to get things done in the wider world. Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world. That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy. Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and says: \Shes done some great trips, and shes highly professional. But its hard to see any particular area where she has really driven policy.\ Gideon Rachman is the FTs chief foreign affairs columnist David Rothkopf: \When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly\ Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued his agenda without upstaging him - an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department. That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with private and non-state actors such as NG0s, as well as dealing with non-state threats. When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly. This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing. Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Koreas nuclear programmes, the rise of emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises. We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the GB to one where you have to work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office. Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature issues - and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

He filed this report: Minutes after Landon Donovan scored the stunning extra-time goal that won a critical World Cup match against Algeria, Bill Clinton and several of his aides and friends (including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe) were escorted downstairs to the U.S. teams locker room. The American players roared with pride as the former president (and honorary chairman of the committee bidding to bring the World Cup to the U.S. in 2018 or 2022) walked in. After a round of embraces, handshakes and high fives, he spoke briefly about his joy in their victory: \I'm proud of you because you didn't let the frustration of all the shots that you almost made get you down. You are amazing!\ Much posing for pictures ensued with the shirtless, whooping, chest-bumping players -- who couldnt quite seem to believe they had done it. The team then invited Clinton alone to join them in the inner locker room, where he could be glimpsed toasting them with a beer amid much additional hollering. When he emerged 10 minutes or so later, he had a broad smile and a hoarse voice. As Clinton left for Johannesburg, where he will meet tomorrow with former President Nelson Mandela, one of the players chased him out into the hall and handed one of the former presidents aides an official ball signed by all the members of Team USA. Clinton stopped for just a moment to talk with the local press before disappearing in a convoy of flashing lights and sirens. \If it hadn't been the decisive game, even I would have said it should have been a tie,\ he said. \It was a great game. You know, all great contests become head games at some point -- sports, elections, wars. And they [Team USA] have good heads and good hearts.\

With Labour leadership contest going through summer theres no real opposition, which is just as well, let Cameron/Clegg dig their own hole. Labour needs a new face after Gordon. Lots of internal tensions inside LDs, will only get worse. They are seen as the enablers. This cant be sustained. This budget isnt the end either. College tuition probably to double this fall, among other new measures.

C05770377	August 8, 2010 Gary Sick America and Iran: Strikes, Sanctions and Scapegoats For the pundits, there are only two questions about U.S.-Iran relations that are of any importance: (1) Will Israel and/or the United States attack Iran? and (2) will the new sanctions have enough bite to persuade Iran to change its nuclear policy? Despite all the printers ink spilled on these two issues, the answers are an easy no and no. Neither the United States nor Israel will take the military option off the table, thereby giving the pundits (and the crowd that is dying to repeat Iraq) latitude to keep the distant prospect of military action on the front pages, where it has been for years. As a lede, it sells columns and newspapers, so it will not go away. But as analysis it is either blinded by the momentary hype or else is simple wish fulfillment. Uber-neocon John Bolton had it right. If any such attack were to occur, it would have been at the end of the Bush administration when there was nothing left to lose. Bolton thought it was so inevitable that he predicted it unequivocally in a Wall Street Journal column in 2008. Dick Cheney apparently agreed, judging from his subsequent statements of regret. So it is fair to say that George W. Bush, after looking the potential consequences, resisted the advice of his neocon advisers, his previously dominant vice president, and the reported direct request from the government of Israel — and rejected a strike. What is the likelihood that Barack Obama, with the same catastrophic scenario before him, will approve? Forget it. Sanctions do not persuade dictatorial regimes to abandon projects that they think are central to their security and survival or even their self-image. Just look at Saddam Hussein. The international sanctions imposed on Iraq in the 1980s make the current Iran sanctions appear anemic in comparison. Every item that went in and out of Iraq was subject to approval by a UN committee dominated by a vindictive United States. Yet, although Iraq had abandoned its nuclear weapons program years earlier, Saddam could not bring himself to let his own people and his enemies know that. Instead he was prepared to gamble that the United States would not attack him. One of the reasons for this bad bet was that he and his cronies were doing so well under the sanctions that there was no immediate necessity to come clean. They, after all, controlled the smuggling routes. And their henchmen managed the thriving and enormously lucrative black market. As for concern with their own people, a rotund Tariq Aziz, sitting with a fine Scotch and a Cuban cigar, informed a worried UN representative that it would be good for the Iraqi people to lose some weight. An Iraqi friend of mine told me at the time that the sanctions had made criminals of the entire Iraqi middle class, which had to resort to illegal behavior in order to survive. The biggest – and most successful – of this new criminal class was the privileged group immediately around Saddam Hussein. Which brings us to Iran. The sanctions are more effective than many anticipated. They have built a web of financial restrictions and limitations around the already weak Iranian economy that is certain to cause significant problems for the leadership. Irans critical energy sector is particularly vulnerable. It is in a pincer. Because of cheap energy prices inside the country, artificially propped up by massive subsidies, energy demand is soaring. This siphons off a lot of Irans oil production, which would otherwise be sold on the world market for hard currency. At the same time, because Irans oil fields are old and complex, they require modern technology to maintain production. That technology – and the capital investment that can only be provided by the major international oil companies – has been absent for many years. It was driven away partly by the sanctions, ironically assisted by Irans own short-sighted negotiating tactics that offered only the most meager profit margins to outside investors. As a result, Irans oil production is in decline at the same time that more and more of it is being soaked up by domestic consumption. In a period of relatively low oil prices, this means that Irans hard currency earnings are drying up at an alarming rate. This unenviable economic situation is compounded by what has to be described as perhaps the least competent economic management team of any major country in the world. Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, seems totally preoccupied with bolstering his own shaky political legitimacy by pandering to the Revolutionary Guards who surround and protect him. The result is corruption on a scale beyond anything the shahs regime could have imagined. President Ahmadinejad, also a creature of the Revolutionary Guards, is free to indulge his taste for outlandish and irresponsible rhetoric. His words keep the international and domestic spotlight glued to him; but the effect drives away prospective investors and facilitates the U.S. drive to enlist international support for sanctions against Iran. An American Jewish leader once joked with me that he suspected Ahmadinejad was a Mossad agent: no one, he observed, had been more helpful in promoting donations to Israel and Israeli causes. At the same time, under his leadership Iran has inflation and unemployment that are both in double digits. But to be fair, Ahmadinejad is the first politician in modern Iranian history willing to address the \third rail\ of Iranian politics — the immensely costly subsidies on food and energy. His initial efforts to reduce the amount of subsidized gasoline that Iranians could use met with outbursts of indignation, including torching filling stations. But these rules now seem to be grudgingly accepted and have eased slightly Irans energy dilemma. He is now addressing the low tax rates assessed against merchants. This has also resulted in outrage, including closing the bazaars in Iran and other major cities. But his campaign seems to be making progress. These are needed reforms that would be recommended by any responsible economic overseer, including the International Monetary Fund. Ahmadinejad attempts to balance his daring assaults on the entrenched economic interests by his belligerent rhetoric, always casting himself as the champion of the little guy. In that he resembles his populist predecessors, from Juan Peron to Huey Long to Hugo Chavez. Ahmadinejad takes on America and Israel the way Governor Long took on Standard Oil. But like other populists, Ahmadinejad is the prisoner of his own eccentric view of the world and his loyalty to lieutenants who may or may not be worthy of his faith in them. The key question about Iran today is not whether it will be attacked or collapse under sanctions. It is whether Iran is capable under its present leadership to take a sober decision about how to deal with the outside world. The Revolutionary Guards have established a dominant position in Irans military, its economy, and its politics. Iran increasingly comes to resemble the corporatist states of southern and eastern Europe in the 1920s and 30s that we call fascist. Iran is conducting an interior battle with its own demons, from the millenarians on the far right who choose to believe that Khamenei is the personal representative of God on earth, to the pragmatic conservatives who simply want a more responsible leadership, to the reformists of the Green movement whose objective is to put the \republic\ back into the Islamic Republic by giving the people a greater voice. This is a yeasty and unpredictable mix. No one knows what is going to happen next. And this is the reality that the Obama administration must deal with. The danger is not that the administration will back the wrong horse in Iran. The real danger is that the Obama administration will be so preoccupied with domestic American politics and its constant demand to look tough when dealing with Iran that it will inadvertently rescue this cruel but hapless regime from its own ineptitude by providing a convenient scapegoat for everything that goes wrong in Iran.

C05770565	WASHINGTON (AP) - The Obama administration targeted key leaders of Afghanistans Taliban with new financial sanctions Thursday in a move that could complicate relations with Pakistan and Afghan efforts to reconcile with insurgents. The action by the Treasury Department will freeze the militants assets, ban travel and trigger an arms embargo. It follows similar action by the United Nations earlier this week, and comes after calls from Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for sanctions against Afghan insurgent commanders operating in Pakistan. Taken together, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions prohibit any financial transactions of the terror leaders in U.N. member countries, putting additional pressure on Pakistan to take broader actions against the Taliban militants. Three financial kingpins were targeted with sanctions, including a key member of the Haqqani network, which,directs operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan from safe havens in Pakistan. Among those sanctioned Thursday was Nasiruddin Haqqani, an emissary for the Haqqani Network and brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani who leads the group with his father, Jalaluddin. Others sanctioned included Gul Agha Ishakzai, the head of the Talibans financial commission and Amir Abdullah, the former treasurer to captured Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Barader. The sanctions placed on the three leaders as terrorists would deprive them of the assets they need to fund their terror operations, said Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control. \We will continue to aggressively work to expose and dismantle the financial networks of terrorist groups in support of the president's goal of a stable Afghanistan,\ he said. According to officials, lshakzai is the head of the Talibans financial commission, has collected money for suicide attacks in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and has been involved in the disbursement of funds for Taliban fighters. He has served as a main financial officer and close adviser to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. Abdullah has reportedly traveled to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates to raise money for the Taliban and facilitate meetings and communications with key leaders. Nasiruddin Haqqani has collected funds for the Haqqani group, including from al- Qaida. Last week, Gen. David Petraeus, the top military commander in Afghanistan, urged officials to add commanders from the Haqqani network to the terrorist list. At the time, administration officials said a review was under way, largely accelerated after the May 1 failed Times Square bombing. The man who has pleaded guilty in the New York incident, Pakistani-born American Faisal Shahzad, said he trained with the Pakistani Taliban to build bombs, then returned to the U.S. to launch an attack that would avenge attacks on Muslims by U.S. forces overseas.

C05770950	Published on The New Republic (http://www.tnr.com) The Unnecessary Fall A counter-history of the Obama presidency. • John B. Judis • August 12, 2010 I 12:00 am On April 14, 2009, as Barack Obamas standing in the polls was beginning to slip, and as Tea Party demonstrators were amassing in Washington for tax day protests, the president gave a lengthy address atGeorgetown University explaining the \five pillars\ of his economic policies. The speech was intended to promote a memorable slogan for Obamas program that would evoke comparisons with Theodore Roosevelts Square Deal, Franklin Roosevelts New Deal, and Lyndon Johnsons Great Society. Obamas contribution was to be the New Foundation. \We must lay a new foundation for growth and prosperity—a foundation that will move us from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and invest,\ he declared. Obama would repeat the phrase seven times that day and on many more occasions over the next months. At Obamas private White House dinner with presidential historians that June, the historians were no more impressed than the public with the New Foundation as a slogan. \I dont think its going to work,\ Robert Dallek warned. Doris Kearns Goodwin said it sounded \like a womans girdle.\ One of these historians might have been able to forewarn Obama that the slogan had been unsuccessfully deployed by a Democratic president once before. In his 1979 State of the Union address, Jimmy Carter began, \Tonight, I want to examine in a broad sense the state of our American Union—how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world.\ Carter would use the phrase five times in the speech, including in its conclusion, where he asked members of Congress to join him \in building that new foundation.\ Like Obama's effort, the phrase inspired, at most, a few underwear jokes and was then forgotten. Obama's evocation of Carter was obviously unintended—but the Man from Plains is indeed the specter now hanging over his presidency. Of course, Obama has already accomplished more in his first 20 months than Jimmy Carter did during his entire presidency. But there is a disturbing political resemblance between the two presidencies. Both men ran inspired campaigns in which they positioned themselves above the scandals and partisan quarrels of their predecessors and initially stirred hopes of a \transformational\ presidency. But, as presidents, both men somehow failed to connect with large parts of the electorate. To be sure, there are a number of very specific reasons why Carter and Obama landed in political trouble. Both men contended with rising unemployment—Carter with rampant inflation as well—and voters' approval of a president and his party tend to track closely with changes in the economy. Carter faced friction in his own party and the rise of a powerful business lobby, and Obama has dealt with a Republican Party that has frustrated his dreams of a post-partisan presidency. Yet the most important reason for their difficulties—evident in their inept attempts to brand their programs—has been an inability to develop a politics that resonates with the public. In the United States, politics pivots around the allegiance of the middle class, even as its identity has changed from yeoman farmers and mechanics to store clerks, office workers, x-ray technicians, and small business owners. They are, in Bill Clinton's words, \those who work hard and play by the rules.\ They are the central characters in a populist rhetoric that goes back to the early republic. It depicts the middle class as embattled and threatened either from forces below (impoverished immigrants, welfare cheaters, ghetto rioters) or above (Wall Street speculators, state bureaucrats, K Street lobbyists). Populism can be embraced by Glenn Beck or Tom Harkin. It is intrinsically neither left-wing nor right-wing. Politicians, such as Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan, who found a way of using populism's appeal during downturns have enjoyed success, while those who have spurned it have suffered accordingly. If, in circumstances like the present one, you don't develop a populist politics, your adversaries will use populism to define you as an enemy of the people. That's what Carter discovered during the stagflation of the late '70s. And that's what has happened in the last 20 months of the Great Recession to Barack Obama and to the Democratic Party he leads. Obama took office with widespread popular support, even among Republicans, and some of his first efforts, including the $800 billion stimulus, initially enjoyed strong public favor. But that wide appeal began to dissipate by the late spring of 2009. Disillusion with Obama fueled the November defeat of Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia. By January 2010, it was a crucial factor in Republican Scott Brown's astonishing victory over Martha Coakley in Massachusetts. In the postmortem debate over these defeats, some Democrats have blamed Obama's dogged pursuit of health care reform while the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. That may have been a factor, but the real damage was done earlier. What doomed Obama politically was the way he dealt with the financial crisis in the first six months of his presidency. In an atmosphere primed for a populist backlash, he allowed the right wing to define the terms. As Obama was delivering his inaugural address, the financial crisis was already in full swing; and it was already apparent that financial speculation, outright fraud, and irresponsible and sometimes illegal housing-loan practices had played a very large role in precipitating the crisis. The public was up in arms. But, instead of rallying the public against the \money changers,\ as Roosevelt had done in his first inaugural, Obama, taking a leaf from Jimmy Carter's infamous \malaise\ speech, put the blame on the public as a whole. \Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age,\ he declared. Over the next month, Obama would periodically criticize bankers after embarrassing revelations—at various times calling the bonuses they gave themselves \shameful\ and an \outrage\—but, after hearing complaints about his rhetoric from the bankers, he would back off. At a private meeting on March 28 with 13 Wall Street CEOs, the president, his spokesman Robert Gibbs said, \emphasized that Wall Street needs Main Street and Main Street needs Wall Street.\ And, in his Georgetown speech, Obama returned to his theme of collective responsibility. The recession, Obama said, \was caused by a perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street.\ Obama's policy followed the same swerving course as his rhetoric. One week, he would favor harsh restrictions on bank and insurance-company bonuses, but, the next week, he would waver; one week, he would support legislation allowing bankruptcy judges to reduce the amount that homeowners threatened with foreclosure owed the banks; the next week, he would fail to protest when bank lobbyists pressured the Senate to kill these provisions. But, more importantly, Obama—in sharp contrast to Roosevelt in his first months—failed to push Congress to immediately enact new financial regulations or even to set up a commission to investigate fraud. (When Congress finally appointed a commission in July 2009, Obama and his party put a milquetoast Democratic politician, former California State Treasurer Philip Angelides, in charge of it.) Obama's appointments also conveyed an impression that he wanted to let Wall Street off the hook. He appointed Timothy Geithner to be treasury secretary. Geithner claimed that he was not part of Wall Street, but, in his capacity as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he had served under a board of directors headed by JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. As New York Fed president, Geithner had been partly responsible for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go under, for the unpopular tarp program, and for American International Group (MG) paying back its Wall Street creditors with government money. Geithner chose as his chief of staff a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. Retiring Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan told me, \Most Americans were reading about the massive compensations and bailouts, and the administration largely hired people from the culture of Wall Street.\ By the spring, Obama's apparent tilt to Wall Street had sparked a right-wing populist revolt in the country. The newly formed Tea Party movement, Beck and Fox News, and a host of right-wing bloggers were leading the charge; but, in a less extreme form, the general public shared their anger. In an early April New York Times/CBS News poll, the public disapproved of Obama's aiding the banks by 58 percent to 33 percent. In this same poll, public approval of Obama's handling of the economy began to fall. Pollsters who did focus groups also traced disillusionment with Obama's economic policies to his handling of the financial crisis. Congressman Barney Frank, who defends Obama's policies, acknowledges that the president's political difficulties began with the revelation that MG, which had received $170 billion from the government, had paid out $165 billion in bonuses to the division that had brought the company down. Geithner had known about the bonuses but insisted there were no legal grounds to block them. (It then came out that Geithner had pressured Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd to insert a provision in the stimulus bill that protected the bonuses.) \The pitchforks were out. It added injury to injury,\ Frank says. That's when public opinion of Geithner plummeted. According to a Rasmussen poll, 24 percent had a favorable view of Geithner and 44 percent an unfavorable one. The public's view of the bank bailout and the AIG bonuses colored its view of the auto bailout, the stimulus, and health care reform. One of the rallying cries for the populist opposition to Obama was \wheres my bailout?\ (Obama himself acknowledged that it was \one of the most frequent questions\ he was asked in letters.) The auto program became a bailout for the Big Three CEOs; the stimulus became a bailout of government itself; and health care reform was a bailout for the uninsured—or \reparations,\ as Rush Limbaugh put it. Wrote right-wing blogger Michelle Malkin, \hardworking citizens were getting sick of being played for chumps\ by \moochers, big and small, corporate and individual, trampling over themselves with their hands out demanding endless bailouts.\ Obama and the Democrats were successfully portrayed as aiding \the moochers,\ but not the \hardworking citizens.\ In American politics, thats a recipe for political disaster. Some in the White House political operation recognized in the late spring that the administrations economic efforts were being defined by right-wing populism and tried to push Obama to take a more populist tack. A group within the White House began calling themselves the \pitchfork gang,\ but they would find their attempts to convince Obama to get tough on Wall Street or on insurance companies undermined by Geithner and by National Economic Council head Larry Summers, who were worried about upsetting business confidence. \There was a continual tension in the White House,\ says a person who was privy to the discussions. \One week, we would be very hot, and then, the next week, we would dial it back.\ By early January of this year, Obama was clearly losing the battle for the middle class. According to a CNN poll, 60 percent of Americans thought Obama \had paid more attention to the problems faced by banks and other financial institutions\ than to the \problems faced by middle class Americans.\ Only 28 percent, barely more than a quarter, thought he had paid more attention to the middle class. As Brown surged ahead of Coakley in the polls, the White House temporarily embraced a populist approach. On January 14, Obama called the bank bonuses \obscene\ and said, \we want our money back.\ In a January 22 speech at Lorain County Community College in Elyria, Ohio (a far cry from Georgetown), Obama used the word \fighting\ 13 times and \fight\ nine times. \I will not stop fighting for you,\ he declared. But, faced with a falling stock market and anger from Wall Street, Obama once again turned conciliatory. On February io, he said that he didnt \begrudge\ the $17 million bonus awarded to Dimon and the $9 million to Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein. \I know both guys. They are very savvy businessmen.\ Obamas reluctance to rail against Wall Street might have led to a watered-down financial reform bill, or even no bill at all, but, on April 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission indicted Goldman Sachs for fraud. The next week, an emboldened Obama went to New York to criticize the bankers directly for their \failure of responsibility.\ As a result of the indictment and Obamas rediscovery of his anger, Republicans became somewhat less obstructionist, moderate Republicans broke with the partys leadership, and moderate Democrats fell into line. Congress produced a much stronger bill than the Democrats had ever expected. But Obamas embrace of populism has remained fitful and sporadic. After the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Verizons Ivan Seidenberg, the head of the Business Roundtable, criticized Obama for being anti-business in June, the president dispatched Geithner, White House aide Valerie Jarrett, and Bill Clinton to appease the business community. Obama has said enough to anger the CEOs, but he has failed to convey to the greater public that he is fighting for them. Obamas unwillingness to buck Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, along with his delayed and muddled response to the BP disaster in the Gulf, has eroded the publics confidence in his leadership. In Pews midyear report card on Obamas image, the greatest drop from February 2009 to this June was in the perception of Obama as a \strong leader.\ Voters will sometimes tolerate policies they question from presidents like John Kennedy or Reagan, whom they regard as \strong,\ but not from politicians like Jimmy Carter, whom they regard as weak. What of the other factors behind Obamas political difficulties? There is no doubt that, if the economy were growing faster, and if unemployment were dropping below 9 percent, Obama and the Democrats would be more popular and not fearing a November rout. But, unfortunately, the economys sluggish recovery cannot be completely disentangled from the White Houses weak political performance. In January, when the White House debated how large a stimulus to propose, Christina Romer, the head of the Council of Economic Advisors, proposed a $1.2 trillion Keynesian jolt. David Obey, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, told The Fiscal Times that Obamas Treasury Department asked initially for a $1.4 trillion bill. But the administration finally proposed a stimulus between $700 and $800 billion that included large tax cuts that were more likely to stimulate saving than consumption—and spending that would be unlikely to produce many jobs until the end of Obamas first term. In the stimuluss first year, the administration spent only $17 billion of the $139 billion allocated for infrastructure spending. Prominent economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, made the case that a much larger stimulus was necessary to reverse (rather than merely reduce) the rise in unemployment, and that, if a modest stimulus failed to reduce unemployment, Republicans would convince the public that the stimulus was toxic medication and would block additional Keynesian measures. That argument has been proven sadly correct. Some White House advisers appear to have underestimated the depth of the Great Recession. Others seem to have doubted the administration had the political clout to get more from Congress. But the White House might have gotten more if Obama had proclaimed a national economic emergency (which it was); framed the issue in terms of rescuing the middle class from damage done by Wall Street speculators, short-sighted CEOs, and Chinese mercantilism; and directly attacked Republicans as heartless obstructionists. When Obama belatedly made this sort of case on the eve of the financial reform vote this year, he got a much stronger bill than anyone had anticipated. So its not clear that the failure to get a larger stimulus—which has ended up hurting the administration politically—wasnt itself a result of political timidity. The president has also suffered from an inability to explain to the public why he sought such a large stimulus and what he thought it could accomplish. Obamas New Foundation speech at Georgetown was soon forgotten. Afterward, Obama, to the dismay of Democrats in Congress and some of his White House aides, pretty much dropped the jobs issue. From then to Labor Day, he devoted a July visit to Buffalo and an August stopover in southern Indiana to the issue—at a time when the right wing was mobilizing against him. Obama didnt just fail to develop a consistent narrative about the economy; he didnt really try. Contrast Obamas attempt to develop a politics to justify his economic program with what Reagan did in 1982. Faced with steadily rising unemployment, which went from 8.6 percent in January to 10.4 percent in November, Reagan and his political staff, which included James Baker, Mike Deaver, and Ed Rollins, forged a strategy early that year calling for voters to \stay the course\ and blaming the current economic troubles on Democratic profligacy. \We are clearing away the economic wreckage that was dumped in our laps,\ Reagan declared. Democrats accused them of playing \the blame game,\ but the strategy, followed to the letter by the White House for ten months, worked. The Republicans were predicted to lose as many as 50 House seats, but they lost only 26 and broke even in the Senate. Some commentators have noted Reagans popularity was even lower than Obamas. But, on key economic questions, he did much better than Obama and the Democrats are currently performing—and voters expressed far greater patience with Reagans program. According to polls, even as the unemployment rate climbed, a narrow plurality still expressed confidence that Reagans program would help the economy. On the eve of the election, with the unemployment rate at a postwar high, a New York Times/CBS News poll found that 6o percent of likely voters thought Reagans economic program would eventually help the country. Thats a sign of a successful political operation. If Obama could command those numbers, Democrats could seriously limit their losses in November. But Obama has not been able to develop a narrative that could convince people to trust him and the Democrats. Why has the White House failed to convince the public that it is fighting effectively on its behalf? The principal culprit is clearly Barack Obama. He has a strange aversion to confrontational politics. His aversion is strange because he was schooled in it, working as a community organizer in the 198os, under the tutelage of activists who subscribed to teachings of the radical Saul Alinsky. But, when Obama departed for Harvard Law School in 1988, he left Alinsky and adversarial tactics behind. The young lawyer who returned to Chicago and won a seat in the Illinois state Senate in 1996 practiced a very different style of politics. Obamas principal accomplishments in Springfield were bills restricting lobbying and requiring videotaping of confessions in potential death penalty cases. He was not a typical blue-collar, bread-and-butter Chicago Democrat, but the kind of good government liberal that represents the upscale districts of the city, seeing in politics a higher calling and ill at ease with (although not in open opposition to) the citys Democratic machine. He was also a post- racial politician who eschewed the hard-edged, angry rhetoric of Jesse Jackson. (That, too, is oddly reminiscent of Carter, who partly campaigned in 1976 as the white Southern antidote to George Wallaces angry racial populism.) Obama carried this outlook into the U.S. Senate, into his campaign for the presidency, and then, into the presidency itself. He is a cerebral, dispassionate, post-partisan; he wants to \end the political strategy that has been based on division,\ to \turn the page\ on the culture wars of the 1960s and the partisan battles of the 1990s. During the campaign, his aides jokingly referred to him as the \black Jesus.\ While he can tolerate and even brush aside conflict, he is reluctant to actively foment it. \In a time of crisis, we can't afford to govern out of anger,\ he declared in February 2009. During his campaign and his first year in office, he held to a blind faith in bipartisanship, even as the Republicans voted as a bloc against his legislation. He is, perhaps, ill-suited in these respects for an era of bruising political warfare. His advisers have clearly reinforced these inclinations. In the campaign, they fashioned him as the outsider candidate of \hope\ and \change\ and have extended this strategy into the presidency itself. They see him as standing above party. In a meeting with congressional leaders last April, senior adviser David Axelrod rejected the complaint that Obama accorded equal blame to Democrats and Republicans with his descriptions of the \cynical politics in Washington.\ Within the White House, top aides still speak of promoting the Obama \brand.\ Organizing for America, the administrations campaign organization, which is supposed to be focusing on the 2010 elections, recently devoted its resources to organizing parties across the country to celebrate Obamas forty-ninth birthday. These efforts to elevate Obama above the hurly-burly of Washington politics have been disastrous. Obamas image as an iconic outsider has become the screen on which Fox News, the Tea Party, radicalright bloggers, and assorted politicians have projected the image of him as a foreigner, an Islamic radical, and a socialist. He has remained \the other\ that he aspired to be during the campaign, but he and his advisers no longer control how that otherness is defined. The White House and cabinet officials he appointed have reinforced his aversion to populism. As Jonathan Alter recounts in The Promise: President Obama, Year One, Geithner and Summers repeatedly blocked attempts to get tough on Wall Street on the grounds that doing so would threaten the recovery itself by upsetting the bankers. For most of his first year, Alter writes, \Obama bought the Geithner-Summers argument that the banks were fragile and couldnt be confronted while they remained in peril.\ Its reluctance to come down on the bankers crippled the administration politically, making it far more difficult for it to get its way with Congress on a second stimulus program that would have boosted the recovery and Democrats' political prospects. Bad politics can trump good policy. Populism has profound shortcomings as a worldview. It tends toward demagoguery. In its relentless focus on the middle class, it can ignore or stigmatize those below it. It can prove hostile to a long-range scientific outlook. A more populist Obama, for instance, might have postponed the battle for climate change legislation or national health insurance and probably would have taken a weaker stand on immigration. But populism has been an indelible part of the American political psyche, and those who are uncomfortable making populist appeals, like Hoover or Carter—or, more recently, presidential candidate John Kerry—suffer the consequences at the polls. If Obama's politics leads to a Republican takeover of one or both houses of Congress, and even to a Republican president in 2012, then much of what Obama has accomplished could be undone. It's unlikely that a new Republican president and Congress would actually repeal the health care or the financial reform bill. But the former could be starved of public funds and deprived of regulatory oversight; and the latter could be neutered by a hostile treasury secretary and by weak or hostile presidential appointees to the Securities and Exchange Commission or the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Reform legislation needs administrations and congresses committed to reform. That is where politics has to come in; and that's where the Obama administration, with its aversion to populism, has fallen short. John B.

C05766432	Jake Sullivan Tuesday, January 26, 2010 8:14 AM H; Abed in, Huma (Clinton) call sheet Call_Sheets jjs.docx Attached and pasted below is material for the calls Calls to Brown and Northern Ireland Political Leaders PM Brown has asked to brief you on ongoing negotiations convened by the UK and Irish governments yesterday with FM Peter Robinson and dFM Martin McGuinness and their respective teams, which lasted until 3:30 a.m. in the morning and resumed at 9:00 a.m. today. Sinn Fein and the DUP are apparently not yet meeting face to face at Hillsborough but using the two governments as go betweens. On-site observers have characterized the current atmosphere between the two parties as \poisonous.\ B6 were invited to Hillsborough yesterday night. However, these parties tell us that this was only an informational exercise and they have yet to be included in any substantive meetings. Outstanding Issues: The obstacle to progress seems to be centered on the parades issue and setting of specific dates for devolution. Robinson and the DUP are insisting on the abolishing of the Parades Commission, an independent panel despised by the Orange Order as restricting their desire to parade through nationalist areas, and the adoption of a new process relying on local councils to refer potentially contentious parades to an OFM/dFM selected panel. Sinn Fein and SDLP are both concerned that this will politicize decision-making on parades and PSNI involvement. In late December, the UK government renewed the Parades Commission's mandate until December 2010, so it is expected that any new process would not be implemented until after the summer 2010 parading season. B1 1.4(B) 1.4(D) Key points: B5 Outcomes: If McGuinness resigns (likely along with the other SF ministers) thereby collapsing the current Executive, the Northern Ireland Act provides for seven calendar days for a new Executive to be formed. Failing that, the Assembly cease to operation and Secretary of State Woodward is supposed to schedule new elections though he is not required to do so within a certain timeframe. (Technically, it would take at least five weeks to organize new Assembly elections.) B1 1.4(B) 1.4(E)

Under attack from allied Air and Naval forces, the Libyan Army troops have begun to desert to the rebel side in increasing numbers. The rebels are making an effort togeet these troops as fellow Libyans, in an effort to encourage additional defections. (Source Comment: Speaking in strict confidence, one rebel commander stated that his troops continue to summarily execute all foreign mercenaries captured in the fighting. At the same time Colonel Khalifa Haftzu• has reportedly joined the rebel command structure, in an effort to help organization the rebel forces. Haftar was the commander of the Libyan National Army ([NA), a 1500 man force of anti-Qaddafi troops based in N'djamena, Chad, until current President Idryss Debi overthrew Chadian President Hussein Habre in the fall of 1990, with the assistance of Libyan and French troops. Haftar and his troops lied to a cotaatry in central Africa and many, including Haftar, later settled in the United States.) An extremely sensitive source added that the rebels are receiving direct assistance and training from a small number of Egyptian Special Forces units, while French and British Special Operations troops are working out of bases in Egypt, along the Libyan border. These troops are overseeing the transfer of weapons and supplies to the rebels.

(Source Comment: The rebels are moving back into 'areas that they lost in mid- March fighting, and using the allied air cover, they are confident they can move into the Tripoli district in a matter of days. One rebel source reported that they had reliable intelligence that people were evacuating Qaddafi's hometown, Sirte, anticipating its capture by the rebels. Sirte is located mid-way between Tripoli and Benghazi; its loss will be a psychological blow for Qaddall.) Separately, a sensitive European source stated in strict confidence that French military commanders anticipate a complete collapse of the Libyan military command and control structure in the next week. These officers, who have experience with the Libyan Army during its invasion of Chad in the late 1980s stated that the Libyan troops did not perform well under concentrated fire from troops armed with modern weapons. This source also noted that information from Tripoli has become increasingly difficult to obtain, but there are reports of deaths among some Qaddafi's senior security officials, including Mansour Daw, and that the Libyan leader himself may have experienced a health problem. Unfortunately, the European Intelligence services have been unable to confirm or discredit these reports. This situation has become increasingly frustrating for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, according to knowledgeable individuals, is pressing to have France emerge from this crisis as the principal foreign ally of any new government that takes power. Sarkozy is also concerned about continuing reports that radical/terrorist groups such as the Libyan Fighting Groups and Al Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are infiltrating the NLC. and its military command. Accordingly, he asked sociologist who has long established ties to Israel, Syria, and other B6 nations in the Middle East, to use his contacts to determine the level of influence AQIM and other terrorist groups have inside of the NLC. Sarkozy also asked for reports setting out a clear picture of the role of the Muslim Brotherhood in the rebel leadership. These sources note that French diplomats and intelligence officers in Egypt are in contact with the following rebel figures in Benghazi: MESMAR1Nouri (Qaddafi's former head of protocol, who along with Mousa Kousa was considered the Libyan leaders most loyal follower. Noun currently lives in France; .Gehan (GI-LEI-LAND Abdallah (colonel); CHARRA.NT Faraj, BOUKHRIS Fathi, General Abdelfateh Younis (commander of the rebel forces) (Source Comment: Senior European security officials caution that AQIM is watching developments in Libya, and elements of that organization have been in touch with tribes in the southeastern part of the country. These officials are concerned that in a post-Qaddafi Libya, France and other western European countries must move quickly to ensure that the new government does not allow AQUA and others to set up small, semi- autonomous local entities—or \Caliphates\—in the oil and gas producing regions of southeastern Libya.) These knowledgeable sources add that the insurgents have the following weapons stockpiled in Benghazi: 82 and 120 mm. mortars; GPZ type machine guns; 12.7mm. machine guns mounted on 4x4 vehicles; some anti-aircraft batteries type ZSU 23/2 and 23/4 as well as Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems (MANPADS) type SAM?; some tanks type T-72; U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739594 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

They are reaching out to others to try to find a helpful solution. Amorim called the Brazilian Ambassador here, who tom spoke to after your call. Amorim was very happy with the call, especially the detailed discussion of possible solutions. He professed a desire to work with you to resolve this issue. Brazil recognizes that it is being tagged as the \blocker on democratic language and wants to get out of the way. That explains Amorims heavy push to give this issue back to Insulza. Torn told the Brazilian Ambassador that Insulza has a big credibility problem in our Congress, and that we, Brazil, Mexico, and others cannot walk away from the issue. This was being relayed back to Amorim. Among a core group of countries there is a growing realization that lack of consensus could be very damaging for the OAS and its members. Tom thinks your calls have injected new urgency into the search for a solution. He will be sending a classified update on the latest in a few hours. We will pouch to the house. 83

C05767839	Assume the following two pieces from Dawn in Karachi reached you through other channels, but just to be sure. The first is exactly the bad story I was worried about. The second is the Administrations attempt to shoot it down. Bottom line (another four-letter word): \Whew!\ FIRST STORY Talks under way for N-deal with US: Haqqani By Zulciernain Tahir Monday, 15 Feb, 2010 I 06:02 AM PST I LAHORE: Pakistans Ambassador to US Husain Haqqani has said the government has started negotiating with the United States for an agreement on nuclear technology. \The US is not sceptical about our nuclear programme. Talks between Pakistan and the US for cooperation on atomic programmes are under way and we want the US to have an agreement with us like the one it had with India on civil nuclear technology,\ Mr Haqqani said at a reception hosted by Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer on Sunday. He said Pakistan would get 16 latest F-16 aircraft in June. He said although the expectations of Pakistan and the US with each other usually did not fulfil, both were indispensable for each other. \We have to largely depend upon the US for our defence related matters. \India is our main concern as it is buying weapons worth $100 billion from five countries, including China, and to balance it our relations with the US are very significant,\ he said and added that India had 5,500 tanks and there was a question against whom they would be used. \We cannot be assured by statements that India will not wage a war against us.\ Giving a reason as to why Pakistan had to look towards the US for enhancing its military capacity and capability, Mr Haqqani said the European countries did not offer soft terms for buying weapons. \Ties with the US are important for a secure, stable and prosperous Pakistan.\ Mr Haqqani said Pakistan had also made it clear on the US that it should ensure a strengthened and Islamabad-friendly regime in Kabul before leaving. He said Pakistan had sought drone technology from America. \On one hand our innocent people are losing their lives while on the other Taliban leaders like Baitullah Mehsud get killed in such attacks,\ he said. Mr Haqqani said the US wanted to strengthen democracy in Pakistan and aid under the Kerry-Lugar Bill had started coming from January. In reply to a question, he said Pakistan's embassy in the US was working on diplomatic and legal aspects in Dr Aafia Siddiqui case and was making efforts for securing her release or transfer of her case to a Pakistani court. SECOND STORY No nuclear deal with Pakistan, says US By Anwar lqbal Monday, 01 Mar, 2010 I 07:15 AM PST I WASHINGTON: The Obama administration has told Pakistan it would not get an atomic power plant or a civilian nuclear deal from the United States. A senior US official, while briefing Indian journalists in Washington, said the United States was working closely with Pakistan to help meet its growing energy needs. \But nuclear power is not currently part of our discussions,\ and the United States had conveyed its decision to Pakistan, the official said. He said the administration had also told Pakistan that \there is no way they can get a civilian nuclear deal similar to the one the Obama administration has signed with India\. The lndo-US civilian nuclear deal, the official said, was \specific to India only and there is no thinking going on in the administration to create a template for it.

C05765099	sbwhoeop Monday, November 2, 2009 6:23 PM H FYI: When you have a chance, re: what Wm. Hague told you, relevant undercurrent to EU debate. Sid FrsOrn The Times November 3, 2009 I suggest a night at the theatre, Mr Cameron A sop to the party's Europhobes has left the Conservative leader defending the indefensible. He should be ashamed David Aaronovitch On Friday morning David Cameron called upon David Miliband to apologise. On Friday evening I went to see a play. The play was Our Class, by the Polish playwright, Tadeusz Slobodzianek. In a series of short \chapters\ Slobodzianek followed a group of classmates in a small Polish village from 1925 to 2002. Like the village, the class was half Catholic and half Jewish. In 1941, as the Germans replaced the Russians as the occupiers, almost all the Jews of the area were murdered in a single day. Slobodzianek shows what led up to the massacre and what happened afterwards. It is unbearable. Though the village is not named in the play, it is based on real events that took place at Jedwabne on July 10, 1941. As Poland's Institute of National Memory concluded in 2002, on that day 40-50 Jewish men were forced to parade around the town singing songs, and were then led to a barn on the outskirts where, one by one, they were killed with knives, axes and cleavers and then thrown in a pit. Then 300 or more women and children were led from the town square to the barn and locked inside. Kerosene was poured over the roof and walls and set alight. The screams could be heard from two kilometres away; no one survived. In 2001 it was finally acknowledged what many people had known all along. The murderers hadn't been Germans, but local Poles, as depicted in Our Class. Alexander Kwasniewski, then the Polish President, apologised to the dead Jews and their survivors at a ceremony in Jedwabne \in my own name, and in the name of those Poles whose conscience is shattered by that crime\. History matters. Few believe that as much as the Law and Justice party of Michel Kaminski, who leads the Tory-backed group in the European Parliament. The party's leaders have demanded apologies from the Russians for the massacre of 21,000 Polish officers at Katyn in 1940 and their references to terrible Polish historical suffering have constituted a big part, of their political appeal. But despite his historical sensitivity Mr Kaminski, the MEP for the Jedwabne area, did not support the 2001 apology. He opposed it vigorously, associating himself with the \Committee to Defend the .Good Name of Jedwabne\. Among its leading members were the local priest, Edward Orlowski, who — asked by journalists whether he would be attending the ceremony at which the President apologised — said: \These are all lies. it is not my business. Germans are responsible, so why should we apologiSe?\ Mr Kaminski developed a slightly different rationale. As he told an interviewer for a far-right newspaper, Our Poland, the murders — which he abhorred — were the work of a few outcasts, and that he would only apologise if someone \from the Jewish side\ apologised for how \the Jews\ behaved during the Soviet occupation from 1939 to 1941. Last month Mr Kaminski (who had denied giving the interview) confirmed this position. \If you are asking the Polish nation to apologise for the crime made in Jedwabne,\ he said, \you would require the whole Jewish nation to apologise for what some Jewish communists did in Eastern Poland.\ It is this argument that so incenses me,•as it would anyone, I think, who had sat through Our Class. The idea of collective Jewish Bolshevism was a major anti-Semitic trope before the war; it was a major element of self-justification after it. Mr Kaminski denied the apology, denied the need for it, equated the massacre to \Jewish actions\ and allied himself with those who denied the massacre altogether, fulfilling the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet's observation about patterns of massacre denial: \it never happened, it happened but was justified, they did it to themselves, they did it to us.\ Mr Kaminski's view was described as disgraceful by Mr Miiiband. Having read an enormous amount on Jedwabne in the last few weeks, I think Mr Miliband is completely right — it is disgraceful. And as he might well demand of Mr Cameron: \I should apologise?\ But more than that, I find myself amazed by how Mr Cameron ever came to be in the position of demanding that a foreign secretary, descended from Polish Jews, should apologise for possibly offending the sensibilities of a foreign politician who vehemently opposed there being an apology for the massacre of Polish Jews. I think of all the things that Mr Cameron has got right in his leadership of the. Conservatve Party and my mental jaw drops at the sheer wrongness of it. Now Tory columnists, bioggers and activists are devoting their time to nitpicking sophistry about the nature of collective guilt, and to attacking non-existent \smears\ that they say have been attached to the unlovely person of Mr Kaminski. Why? It is true, as embattled Conservatives have argued, that many of the grand European coalitions contain people whose history is problematic. There are odds and sods in the big conservative grouping, the EPP, and in the socialist group. But these personalities are far outweighed by the parties of the IVIerkels and Sarkozys. The Polish member of the EPP, for example, is the ruling free-market, non-nationalist conservative party of Donald Tusk — almost certainly the party that Mr Cameron would join if he were a Pole. The new Tory grouping, the European Conservatives and Reformists, by contrast, is all about odds and sods whom a continental Cameron would certainly shun, bar one organisation — the British Conservatives. So why get yourself into a position where you have to explain that the Latvian SS wasn't so bad really, and that Mr Kaminski has an understandable position on collective guilt? And the answer seems to be that Mr Cameron promised his Europhobes in his leadership campaign back in 2005 that he would leave the \federalist\ EPP, and that the logical outcome of this move has been the weird alliance that he now finds himself defending. Was it all necessary? No. Was it in Britain's interests? Absolutely not. is it in the interests of progressive Conservatism? You must be joking. So has this happened because Mr Cameron doesn't really care enough about Europe to think through the consequences of his own lightly given promises, or because he's just as much a Euro-nutter as those sects, the Hannanites, the Cashists and the Redwoodians? This is the kind of advice I loathe, but I'll say it anyway. Go to see Our Class, Mr C. This is one hole you don't want to keep digging.

C05767893	Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned By MICHAEL BARBARO March 03, 2010 New York Times A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks. But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. \Its not the right thing to do,\ he said, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation. A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been told that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr. Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand. Mr. Fords decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms. Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights. A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in discussions of \who got there first, and who meant it the most,\ on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee. What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed, was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations. As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist. What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year, among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles. Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. \I think you should give this serious thought,\ he said, of the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would. After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Fords best shot at reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand. Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New Yorks wealthiest and most politically connected executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors. Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. \You can raise the money,\ he told him in December. Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch. \She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up\ was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager, conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation. As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there were \scared and desperate\ about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her city. But Ms. Gillibrands strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January, the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New York politics than Mr. Ford. \With all due respect,\ he asked Mr. Ford, \why do you think you have what it takes to be New Yorks senator?\ Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand would be harder than it seemed. Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, \Its difficult to make a strong case against her here.\ Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage. After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently pushed back, saying he had always supported a womans right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest. It did not. \He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up,\ a friend said. One of Mr. Fords top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloombergs 2009 re-election, arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr. Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements. Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a womans health is in danger? Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut off financing for abortions. \You gave her a pass,\ he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to run he hoped to return to ask for the groups support. Ms. Conlin responded: \We can never support you if you take these positions.\ Mr. Ford \looked shocked,\ a person in the room said. His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the Stonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read \Liar!\ and \Go home snake oil Harry,\ a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in Congress. A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his advisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of his record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Fords chance seemed to be 50-50. \It was not a slam dunk, at all,\ said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data. Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the states black vote, a tall order, but not inconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and Representative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New Yorks black political elite was in seeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified. By Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold Ford Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages. \Im not going to run this time,\ he said in one message. \Thank you for your support.

On Monday at 3.00 pm, the Senate will vote on cloture on the tax bill. They expect to obtain cloture. If the opponents require the use of all 30 hours, post-cloture, they will finish the tax bill on Tuesday evening. It is possible that new START will then be the next order of business. But that hasn't been decided yet.

C05772323	sbwhoeop Saturday, September 11, 2010 2:20 PM H: On NYT website within last hour, in tomorrow's paper. Paid TV ads, please. Sid September 11,2010 G.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists By ERIC LIPTON WASHINGTON — House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory overhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry lobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session. The bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street lobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water it down. \We need you to get out there and speak up against this,\ Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three people familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats. That sort of alliance — they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill — is business as usual for Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS. They have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their corporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for his Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed. Some of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help — calling the congressman and his aides as often as several times a week — to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped them out. As Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party — President Obama mentioned his name eight times in a speech last week — and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists, cultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack. The woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met \countless times with special-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation\ that would regulate corporations and protect consumers. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he \epitomizes the smoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.\ Mr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically motivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that he has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small plastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says. \I get lobbied every day by somebody,\ he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. \It could be by my wife. It could be the bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.\ Mr. Boehner — a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer — is not as fiery as Newt Gingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his reputation as a \Chamber of Commerce\ Republican and his fund-raising skills — he has raised $36 million for Republican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party — that explain, in part, his rise. If elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds coalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong with that. \Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,\ said Mark lsakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm represents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse as Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. \But I think all the good lawmakers do.\ Mr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco lobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had broken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns. His business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the Thursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's legislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership position. But he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars, along with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters, write checks to his campaign and socialize with him. That tight circle includes Mr. lsakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a Citigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists. The tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds, maker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr. Boehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's political career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity. While many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate interests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The members of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff. \He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,\ said Drew Maloney, a lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. \That is how you get things done.\ One lobbyist in the club — after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help — ticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil industry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap on greenhouse gas emissions. Still, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights. But despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists. From 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by companies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.) In addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to popular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been curbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington. Mr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for through his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz Carlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events. In June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund- raising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw large donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans. He turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the Republican National Committee. \The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,\ Mr. Boehner told his supporters, one of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. \But I dont want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because we have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.\ Mr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised nearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates across the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers. The Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like \meetings with Leader Boehner and much much more.\ But his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of access to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House. \He knows this is going to be a tough election,\ said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients include Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. \But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril.\

C05765712	The Independent November 12, 2009 sbwhoeop Thursday, November 12, 2009 8:52 AM H FYI: Murdoch makes his move to Cameron. Attack on BBC to follow. Sid Has Cameron done a deal with Murdoch? By Andy McSmith Lord Mandelsons attack shines spotlight on Tory leaders links with media mogul David Cameron has been accused of making a \contract\ with Britains biggest media company to trade political support before an election for government favours afterwards if the Tories win. The accusation was levelled yesterday by the Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, who is increasingly the public face of Gordon Browns government. Ministers are angry at the campaign that The Sun has run against the Prime Minister all this week over the spelling mistakes in a letter Mr Brown sent to the mother of a young soldier killed in Afghanistan. They suspect that the Conservative Party has been tailoring its policies on media regulation and the BBC to suit the commercial interests of News International, which owns The Sun, and that the papers aggressive support for the Tories is a pay-off that could spread to other parts of the mass media. Examples of the apparent tie-in between what News Internationals boss, James Murdoch, wants, and what David Cameron is ready to promise include the recent decision by the Conservatives to abandon the idea of \top slicing\ the BBC licence fee. It had been proposed that part of the money paid to the BBC would be siphoned off to help regional television companies meet the threat from the internet. But this would also have helped them compete more effectively against Sky News, which is part of the Murdoch media empire. When the policy was abandoned in September, Jeremy Hunt, the shadow Culture Secretary, said that it was because enacting it might make the commercial television companies \focus not on attracting viewers but on attracting subsidies\. There was no gain for the BBC in the climbdown, because David Cameron had already said that the Tories will freeze the licence fee. What it will mean is that the BBCs income will be capped, without the regional television companies seeing any government help, which will strengthen the market position of Britains only satellite television company, Sky. \This was done for News International,\ a Tory insider said yesterday. \Murdoch wants Sky to go head to head with the BBC. He doesnt want the independent companies strengthened.\ In April 2008, James Murdoch complained bitterly about the media regulator Ofcom in his first major speech after taking over as chief executive of News Corporation in Europe and Asia. The following year, David Cameron announced that a Conservative government would cut Ofcom down to size. Last summer James Murdoch attacked the \abysmal record\ of the BBC Trust - the body created by Labour to over see the BBC - in a lecture he gave at the Edinburgh Festival, singling out its \total failure\ to stop the BBC buying the Lonely Planet travel guides, a takeover that Murdoch denounced as an \egregious\ invasion of private enterprise by the state. Less than two months later, Jeremy Hunt promised that the Tories would abolish the Trust. In the same lecture, Murdoch complained that BBC performers like Jonathan Ross are being paid salaries that \no commercial competitor can afford\. He had barely uttered the words before Ed Vaizey, a shadow media minister, promised that a Tory government would compel the BBC to publish the salaries of its top performers. Lord Mandelson alleged yesterday that the Conservatives and News International had \effectively formed a contract, over the head, incidentally, of the newspapers editor and their readers, in which they are sort of bound to one another\. Speaking to the BBCs Today programme, he added: \What The Sun can do for the Conservatives during the election is one part of the contract and, presumably, what the Conservatives can do for News International if they are elected is the other side of the bargain. But there is a wider question. When The Sun creates the news in this way, this is then followed up by Sky News, which then puts pressure on the BBC to follow suit.\ This was \absolutely, categorically\ denied yesterday by The Suns political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, who accused Lord Mandelson of talking \preposterous nonsense\. The Sun, which supported Labour through three general elections under Tony Blairs leadership, announced that it was jumping ship on the day that Gordon Brown delivered his annual speech to the Labour Party conference in September. Its onslaught on Gordon Brown for the mistakes made in a handwritten letter to Jacqui Janes is the most aggressive attack that the newspaper has directed at any Labour Party leader since Neil Kinnock stood down after losing the 1992 general election, a defeat for which The Sun claimed victory with the slogan \It was The Sun wot won it\. But there were signs yesterday that the attack may have rebounded on The Sun. Mr Brown, who is blind in one eye, has admitted that his handwriting is bad and has apologised to Mrs Janes, whose 20-year-old son, Jamie, was killed by a makeshift bomb in Afghanistan last month. A poll yesterday for the website PoliticsHome, whose main shareholder is the Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, found that 65 per cent of those polled thought that The Suns attack was \inappropriate\ compared with 23 per cent who thought it was \legitimate\. The closeness of the new Tory-Sun axis is shown up by the revelation, from an inside source, that David Cameron personally consulted the editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, in three separate conversations before he abandoned his \cast-iron\ promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, now that all 27 members states of the EU have ratified it. Mr Cameron was understandably wary of how The Sun might react to the abandonment of that promise. The paper has campaigned for years against what it sees as the growth of an EU superstate. It was in an open letter to readers of The Sun that Cameron first made his guarantee, two years ago. His announcement that a referendum is off the agenda was subjected to a scathing attack inthe Daily Mail, but in The Sun it was given kid-glove treatment under the headline \Cameron's crusade for UK rights\. The person behind this aggressively pro-Tory policy is James Murdoch, not his father, Rupert, who created The Sun virtually from scratch in the 1970s. Rupert Murdoch claimed in an interview with Sky News Australia that he \regretted\ his sons decision to turn against Gordon Brown, \who is a friend of mine\, but defended it on the grounds that Brown has been a \disappointment\. Yesterday, The Times, another Murdoch newspaper, announced that its veteran political editor, Phil Webster, is leaving the Commons, where he has been based for decades. Mr Webster is very well thought of by New Labour. His replacement, Roland Watson, was a friend of David Camerons at Eton but has no political ties with the Tories. Tom Newton Dunn, newly appointed as The Suns political editor, is another Old Etonian. His father, Bill, used to be a Tory MEP, but defected to the Liberal Democrats in 2000.

C05739739	Im heading back from meetings on women, peace and security at NATO. The chief implementer of WPS at DOD also traveled with me. It was extremely productive. SG Rasmussen chaired a meeting on 1325 today of all the NATO member and partner ambassadors incl DaIcier. The new NATO special rep for 1325 -- the position sponsored by Norway and approved at the Chicago summit — gave her inaugural address, and my DOD colleague and I discussed the US efforts both generally and in Afghanistan. We were followed by extensive remarks from the NATO ambassadors, all of whom touched on the importance of womens role in security and NATOs mission, as well as applauded US leadership. Many mentioned you in their interventions! The ambs from Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia pointed to their own national action plans (their existence was a surprise to us), as well as the new structures they have put in place to implement them. The ambassador from Azerbaijan even said that he is hopeful women will contribute to ending their regional conflict (I will tell Morningstar). The new special rep - a seasoned diplomat who knows her way around NATO --- wanted me to ten you how much you have inspired her -- something I hear everywhere! Im confident our NATO visit also served to reinforce the importance of the NAP and the US role with our own people both at NATO and DOD. I was sorry to miss the discussion with ASSK but there are more events with her tomw. We are working hard on getting the engagement of Burmese women into the formal peace structures being put in place to end the ethnic conflicts. I also met with Vivian Redding at the EU who, despite her efforts, is unlikely to get a quota for women on public boards of directors adopted. She too expressed her admiration of you and your leadership. In addition to everything thats been said about Chris Stevens, he really understood the important role the women in Libya were playing in peace and security. Whenever I met with Libyan women at meetings in the region, they went out of their way to tell me how much he supported them and how much affection they had for him. Such an awful loss. Youve been magnificent throughout all this, despite how wrenching its been.

C05769313	This is an AFP report from today. Also, GTIP is working on a memo for you and Cheryl about child trafficking dangers in Haiti. Trafficking fears as Haiti children go missing Posted 5 hours 47 minutes ago Updated 5 hours 46 minutes ago Slideshow: Photo 1 of 2 The UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek United Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12 earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad. \We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the time,\ said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand. \UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that existed already beforehand. \Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.\ The agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate wake of the quake. However several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States. Mr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago. Trafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of local authorities and relief coordination \to kidnap children and get them out of the country\. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and trafficking in Haiti was \an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and months\. The UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said. Mr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes. \We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,\ he said. \This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable.\ He was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations in Haitis chaos with trafficking. The cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in hospitals. - AFP

C05766989	Great. We're reaching out to them now.
C05766507	Below is from the Economist blogger re efforts wil EU to discredit Ashton, particularly from the French. Wouldn't hurt to mention her positively with French interlocutors. See particularly this line: \There is, frankly, a whiff of old boys network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain.\ A blog by the author of our column on the European Union Charlemagnes notebook . Why did Lady Ashton take the EUs foreign policy job? • Jan 26th 2010, 22:04 NOT yet February, and the briefing against Catherine Ashton, the newly appointed EU foreign policy chief, is getting nasty. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels blogger and well-connected EU correspondent of Liberation, dropped another depth charge against the baroness tonight. His list of complaints against her is long, and I have a feeling some of them are a smidgeon exaggerated. I find it hard to believe it is literally impossible to reach Lady Ashton after eight oclock in the evening as Mr Quatremer charges, because she allegedly has her mobile telephones diverted to the EU situation centre (a small intelligence analysis cell staffed by officers from national servicies) after that hour. I also have some doubts about the stress laid on the fact that she has not yet got round to having top secret security clearance yet, so cannot see any confidential papers. As a former British cabinet minister, and serving UK commissioner, something tells me the British at least may share just the odd secret with her. A senior official I saw today also made the point that any holder of Lady Ashtons post would currently be struggling with teething problems and squabbling as the new foreign policy apparatus created by the Lisbon Treaty takes shape. There is, frankly, a whiff of old boys network against Lady Ashton: she is not a lifetime member of the honourable guild of former foreign ministers, and she is surrounded by men in suits who think they know a lot more about foreign policy than she does. There is not much sympathy for her complicated family life, involving young children, and much commuting between Brussels and Britain. Finally, at the risk of sounding too loyal to the British, I think Mr Quatremer is being unfair when he says that it suits the Foreign Office in London to have Lady Ashton \sabotage\ the post. My impression is that aritich nnvornmpni- fPPlc I (iv Achtnn nePdc a lot of sunnort riaht now and worries she is not getting enough support, but at the same time worries that if she receives too much help in the way of briefings and advice from British officials, she will be seen as a British stooge. That may be a self-serving sort of fear (because it allows the British to offer Lady Ashton lots of help) but it is real enough. Other charges probably have something to them. They certainly chime with things I have been told by other people. But most damaging, to my mind, is the intimate nature of some of the briefing: this stuff is coming from officials close to Lady Ashton, or who are senior enough to have significant contact with her. And I can confirm from my own conversations that people across the whole EU foreign policy machine are asking the same question: why did she take this huge job, when her instinct seems to be to make it as low key as possible? That is a dangerous question mark to have hanging over you.
C05774804	I agree this needs to be addressed. Just let me know how you decide to do so. Thx.

Oren, Israels ambassador to the United States. Mr. Oren said he was not aware that anybody else in the Israeli government had been called and was seeking clarification from the administration. A spokesman for the State Department, Philip J. Crowley, said the United States had \extensive contacts\ with Israel and Turkey before the flotilla set sail. \We expressed to the Israelis the need for caution and restraint in dealing with civilians, including American citizens,\ he said.

C05764995	See below. Will send PIR comments shortly. To: CDM Fr: Caitlin Re: Branch Book Overview: There are few surprises in this book. The \surprises\ that might exist are buried and took a close reading to pick up on—the two main ones are about the terror clause of WJCs crime bill and why he hadnt disclosed information about Lewinsky (because he hadnt wanted to become a witness against her). There are a lot of things that have been covered in My Life and other publications. Quite honestly the book was pretty boring and much more focused on Branch than I had anticipated. While not as \and this day, and the next day\ as My Life, it does share many of the same elements that would engage only a true Clinton fanatic or historian. The fact that there appears to be no index also makes it difficult for anyone looking for a quick hit to get one. Furthermore, WJCs words are so interlaced with Branchs recollection through his dictations, that the number of direct WJC quotes was far fewer than I had expected. HRC was not as much of a player as one might imagine. Her role is largely seen through her interactions with Branch when he is recording WJC. Her statements were consistent with the past, with the exception of the Gephardt comment, and didnt grab much attention at all.Ell (Others included HRCs devotion to CVC, thought that there should not be a special prosecutor and images of her returning from meetings. They were pretty much aligned with her interactions with Branch.) Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, many of the problems discussed in the book are those, which face the current Administration—Middle East peace, North Korea, China, etc... Branch repeatedly injects his feelings on specific subjects and seems to use the book to voice his own opinion of the Administration and events of the time. He clearly has topics he prefers over others (for example his connection with the events in Haiti result in a lot of discussion about it), but there are some subjects that are strikingly sparsely discussed such as Rwanda. Its absence from long discussions was surprising, but it did not appear as thought WJC ever-dodged questions about the topic, they just werent addressed. Much like My Life, one theme that repeated itself was WJCs conflict with and disdain for the media, especially long passages about NYT and Washington Post. There are a few instances where gives them credit on their reporting, but you would be hard-pressed to find them. Additionally, there are numerous mentions of WJCs acute allergies and his chronic fatigue, with imagery of him falling asleep in sessions on more than a couple occasions. The book has quite a bit on Whitewater, but given the dearth of public documentation there is little that Branch could write that hadnt been said. One thing I had not recalled was the DAmatos subpoena of CVCs friends, later quashed, who slept over while HRCs Rose Law Firm records were in the White House. Branch does portray a helpful distinction in how WJC looked at Whitewater and other scandals. While WJC attacks Whitewater as a political hunt, Branch does have him WJC saying that Filegate needed to be separated from Whitewater, because this was a legitimate inquiry. There are some quips that could catch someones eye, such as WJC referring to Paula Jones as \a 'new bimbo' he [WJC] didn't even recognize.\ Branch does not dwell on Lewinsky or the impeachment. With the exception of Bruce, Bennett and Kendall, no other lawyers are mentioned. There is one passage that I am looking into, in which WJC says part of the reason he didnt mention his relationship with Lewinsky at first was because she was being threatened with jail time if she was found to be lying under oath and had he told the truth he could become a witness against her. This is a very small passage that could easily be missed, but one that it is important to note as I dont recall hearing this before. (This is addressed more fully below.) There are a few relationships that track through the book more than others. They include WJCs relationship with Gore, which maps in part because it is not a focal point until the end, and his contentious relationship with Janet Reno. The one Senator that appears to be most discussed negatively is Moynihan. All three of these issues are discussed in turn below. WJC is portrayed as an extremely loving and attentive father and HRC is portrayed in a much more human light than other books/articles covering this time period, with ample mention of her relationship with CVC and images of affection between her and WJC, both pre- and post-impeachment. On foreign relations there is a lot of time spent discussing the Middle East, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, China, Russia, Pakistan/India and in the beginning of the book, Haiti. (Note: Much of what is written about Haiti is about Branchs own experience there and on the subject.) There is also a fair amount of discussion about North Korea, but nothing that has not been discussed in the past few weeks. Bin Laden is discussed in what seems to track mention of him in My Life, which seems to have more detail and background than this book. In certain cases there is more detail here than in My Life, for example on his trip to Pakistan WJC wrote that the USSS cancelled one stop because they would be \defenseless\ flying in, whereas Brach writes that the streets would be lined with \assassins.\ There are candid looks at WJCs take on certain people and the relationship between some, such as Albright and Bergers dislike of Holbrooke, and a more detailed depiction of Yeltsins drinking, such as yelling outside of Blair House for a cab to get pizza. One thing to note, is that often times WJC seems to be speaking to Branch intentionally without the recorders going, but Branch writes about those interactions and exchanges nonetheless. Such is the case with HRCs Gephardt comment. The following items are addressed in the memo: Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill 4 WJC and Lewinskys Silence 4 HRC and Kissinger 4 HRC and gay/lesbian 5 Tension with Moynihan 5 HRC as World Player 5 Jesse Jackson 6 Tension with Janet Reno 6 Portrayal of Carter 7 Relationship with Gore 8 Other (This includes: Maggie recommending Panetta, HRC and Haiti Invasion, ITAV co-author flap, Subpoenas of CVCs Friends, Vernon Jordan on Extramarital Sex, Gore/HRC ticket, WJC suggesting Rubin run for Senate, Trip to South Asia) 11 Wen Ho Lee and Terror Clause of Crime Bill In discussing Wen Ho Lees release Branch characterizes WJCs lack of knowledge about the strained interpretation of the anti-terrorist provisions in the crime bill and arbitrary detentions as a \confession.\ My Life only mentions Lees accusation in passing and does not again discuss Lee. Below are two passages from Branchs book the first giving context and the second about the Terror Clause of the Crime Bill. ➢ The year closed on spies and terrorism. The Justice Department, after fierce debate among the security agencies, indicted nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee on fifty-nine counts of copying classified material to his personal computer. Lee was being handled like a radioactive espionage defendant—no bail, lockdown, solitary confinement—even though the long dragnet had produced no evidence that he offered secrets to China or anyone else. The president said experts were telling him the worst spies sometimes stored their treason for a rainy day. This sounded fishy to me. Clinton shrugged. Nothing would please him more than to establish Lees innocence. [Branch, 577] ➢ While Lee was indicted, Branch writes that WJC noted that others \were being held in secret, uncharged and untried...He [WJC] was embarrassed not to have sponsored this measure into law without foreseeing such arbitrary detentions...Under the terrorist act, any prosecutor should decide within the legal limit...whether to bring charges on the testimony of a secret informant or otherwise. To his dismay, Clinton had learned of defendants held incommunicado for more than six months. One extreme detention had last three years. I think its wrong, he [WJC] said. Its not American. We accept guilty people on the street to enjoy and protect our freedom. [Branch, 629] WJC and Lewinskys Silence Branch writes that part of WJCs motive for not discussing what had happened with Lewinsky was that it could send her to jail, as she had denied it. ➢ \Also, he pointed out that Starr had been threatening to jail Lewinsky all year over her sworn denial of the affair. If Clinton had come forward with anything at all about their relationship, he said Starr could have turned him into a witness against Lewinsky, betraying her discreet silence. Such subtleties, while original, struck me as tendentious. The president never claimed chivalry as the real motive for his steadfast denial, nor did he dispute the essential truth of Lewinskys account.\ [Branch, 511] HRC and Kissinger The following could be fodder for people who want to continue to string along the notion of channeling Eleanor Roosevelt. ➢ There is a passage in which HRC describes an exchange she had with Kissinger at a dinner where he complained that if the health care bill passed he wouldn't be able to see his own doctor. She continued to say \it was interesting, in fact, that she had dreamed about Kissinger only a few nights before. His visage turned suddenly effervescent at a banquet, announcing gladly that his worries were over because the Clinton health care bill was dying. Oh, no, Dr. Kissinger, she replied coolly. Dont be sure that its dead. Well keep fighting, and theres always light at the end of the tunnel. She said Kissing blanched, speechless at her deft reminder of the Vietnam War...Now at last, in Hillarys dream, it registered that his strategic designs had spewed carnage and venom for seven needless years...Thats what I dreamed, Hillary repeated, lost in thought. You know, I always get my revenge in dreams, but never in real life. [Branch, 179] HRC and gay/lesbian Writing about a call with HRC from NYS, Branch recalls how WJCs counsel got very \exercised.\ WJC left the room. \He was subdued on his return. You know, Ive had a lot more contact with gay people in my life than Hillary. He sighed. Her temperament had a conservative, religious core, formed before homosexual issues were even mentionable. New York politics was a tough crucible, and she was unsure what heat she could take. On the other hand, personal experience could speed adaptation.\ [Branch, 551] Tension with Moynihan There are several occasions throughout the book that Branch recalls WJC's grievances and frustration with Moynihan. For example: > When Moynihan called for the international arms embargo to be unilaterally lifted so that Bosnia could fight for themselves, Branch writes, \The president flinched when I mentioned [it]...Thats just a freebie for him, snapped Clinton, and he knows it.\ [p.140] > In regard to health care: \Echoing comments by Hillary at dinner, he [WJC] faulted Senator Moynihan for aimless hearings conducted without a strategy or theme.\ [p.170] ➢ Discussing Independent Counsel: \She [HRC] was especially scornful of the Democrats, and quoted a number of them. Senator Moynihan, for instance, publicly said the Clintons were nice people and he was sure they had nothing to hide. Why not have an investigation? he often asked. She said Moynihan skated blithely on the surface, never produced results in Congress, and could not withstand such scrutiny himself for five minutes, living in an apartment secured through his chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.\ [Brach, 182] ➢ \Donnybrook\ argument in which Moynihan said of a fundraising speech WJC gave citing a regretted hypothetical about a controversial decision. Moynihan told the press, \He doesnt understand...that hes conceding the principles.\ WJC confronted him about lack of context given to the statement to the press and said that Moynihan knew what he was doing by \feeding the beast of hostile presumption about Clintons motives.\ [Branch, 299] HRC as World Player There are several images as HRC as a player on the world stage, both with WJC and on her own. Several examples follow: ➢ Middle East: Discussing peace with King Hussein: \They had retreated for lunch as two couples—the Clintons, with the king and his wife, Queen Noor—in the family dining room... Their agenda was a delicate race between Husseins failing health and his desire to make peace with Israel. The president said he and Hillary pounded away on symptoms of national estrangement: closed boarders, water disputes, travel barriers, war grievances, contested airspace, sealed electrical grids, and so on. Hussein gave them a feast of goodwill without commitment on any point.\ [Branch, 170] > South Asia: Regarding her trip to South Asia with CVC in 1995, \Her [HRCs] schedule was far more demanding than ceremonial, pushing both conflict resolution and civic empowerment for downtrodden women.\ [Branch, 236] Later Branch tells of Benazir Bhutto praising CVC and HRC. \By contrast with a superficial American press, which portrayed Hillary as a demure tourist of no policy significance in exotic Asia, Bhutto said she had touched essential political chords with whirlwind encouragements for citizenship groups and small-scale economic development.\ (The note contrasting Bhutto corresponds to a NYT article which Branch quotes in the footer saying, \she [HRC] played the traditional role of First Lady as wife and mother...\) [Branch, 246] > China Speech: Branch outlines how HRC felt the speech needed to be bigger than China and how she depicted the \harsh reality everywhere\ from China to Africa. He then cites WJC commenting on the rave reviews of HRC's speech. [Branch, 289] ➢ Regarding the Russian financial system meltdown, Branch writes \Yeltsin seemed so removed from urgent political tasks that both Clintons counseled him directly.\ [Branch, 512-513] Jesse Jackson Branch writes about Jesse Jackson calling CVC after the Lewinsky story broke and having continued contact with her throughout the period. WJC thanks him for his support of CVC. This goes into some detail about WJCs gratitude, but the fact that Jackson \counseled\ CVC has been public knowledge dating back to at least 1999. ➢ \But now Jesse had done something he would not forget. When the Lewinsky news broke, he called Chelsea at Stanford. Jesse was the only nonfamily adult with her cell phone number. How he got it was another story. Jesse said he knew this was terrible for her. Nothing like it had ever happened in American politics. He did not know everything involved, but he wanted to remind Chelsea how much her parents loved her. Their family needed to stick together now above all, and if she needed to counsel, rage, or pray, he was always available.\ [Branch, 497] Tension with Janet Reno Throughout the book, from his nomination of her, WJC is portrayed as having no opinion to having a negative opinion of Janet Reno. > \He complained about Janet Reno—made it clear, in fact, that he felt alienated from his own attorney general. If he removed her, however, the pending decision on yet another special prosecutor [for 1996 campaign finance] would fall to Renos deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who, Clinton feared, may share Renos wholesale devotion to outside control for any case in which the president himself may become a target...If he removed both Reno and Gorelick, to start fresh, it would touch off a firestorm of protest like Nixons Saturday Night Massacre of the Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal. That was not an option.\ [Branch, 388-389] > Branch writes about WJC talking about Reno and Louis Freeh disregarding a letter from DAmato and continuing to allow independent counsel to go after Ciseneros. The same held true for Mike Espy. Branch then outlines a meeting between WJC and Reno. Reno had made public statements about her \desire to stay on the job. 'I told her I didn't like that one damn bit,' the president said tersely. 'I didn't hire her to work for the New York Times and Washington Post. I hired her to work for me.'\ [Branch, 398] He continues to outline that Clinton did give Reno credit for some good achievements including coordination with U.S. attorneys and that he didnt blame her for the special prosecutor on Whitewater, but that \he did blame her for abdicating responsibility to supervise the investigations ever since, letting mandates multiply almost at will. She accepted criteria that were ludicrous and crassly partisan. Reno had failed to defend the presidency itself—not Clinton personally, but the institution—and by extension the entire executive branch...He told me she had no clue what he meant. His advisers considered her more naïve than upright, and the fuzziness of the distinction seemed to save her.\ [Branch, 399] He cites that Clinton warned her that she should prepare herself for not staying in the job for the entire second term. Portrayal of Jimmy Carter There are parallels that could be drawn between WJC/BHO and Carter/WJC both in terms of Carters trip to North Korea and the mission he went on to Haiti. WJC clearly was frustrated by Carters seeming desire to be on the front lines. North Korea: ➢ \On North Korea, he [WJC] said Jimmy Carter had initiated his own recent trip with a call to Al Gore, and Clinton had approved the volunteer mission to break through North Koreas extreme isolation... Sure enough, Carter did reach North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung, who proposed to allow inspection of North Koreas nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from the harsh economic sanctions. The only hitch was that Carter announced the terms on CNN before they became official, adding gratuitously that he never had agreed with sanctions in the first place. News stories had the White House seething, but Clinton made light of the spat. He said the deal was since ratified by an exchange of letters, and he did not believe Carter would criticize official policy if the game were still in doubt. [Branch, 162] Haiti: ➢ After pushing to be sent to Haiti and enlisting Colin Powell and Sam Nunn to get WJC to break with Gore (who said Carter shouldnt be trusted a second time) and Christopher and approve the mission to Haiti to seek a truce with the junta, Carter is portrayed as acting stubbornly and having clientitis (arguing for acceptance of Haitian generals versus what was in the United States best interest). He didnt want to leave and WJC told him he had to. Like after North Korea, Carter again, Carter went to the press first. \The three negotiators flew back to Washington late Sunday, and Carter, invited to stay over at the White House, called CNN's Judy Woodruff after midnight to arrange an interview the next morning before he reported to Clinton on his mission. This conduct, the president said tersely, was not right...The press was full of retrospective stories about friction between him and his three prominent negotiators...He said the current newsweeklies lapped up criticism by Carter as an embarrassment to Clinton...Many of his advisers griped that Jimmy Carter thought he was still president, but Clinton found this criticism too jaundiced. Carter had spoken with restraint at their joint press conference, he allowed, exhibiting a keen political ear...To Clinton, Carter simply felt that he had earned the right to speak his mind as an international statesman, even about a mission he had accepted for the United States government complete with an Air Force jet. This sense of entitlement could make Carter a thorn, but Clinton thought his value far outweighed the political annoyance. He considered Carter a sterling ex- resident.\ [Branch, 200-201] Dispatch of Bombers Near Iraq ➢ \He expected military strikes to win bipartisan assent, including former presidents Ford, Reagan and Bush. 'Dole will support me,' he said. 'Carter will probably criticize me. Carter always criticizes, but he doesn't have much positive to say.\ [Branch, 518] Gore For the majority of the book, there is little discussion of WJC and Gores relationship. There are few places where he is briefly mentioned and a couple of scenes with some levity. The end, however, describes the seemingly brutally candid conversation between the two about the 2000 election and the impeachment. ➢ On page 92 Branch writes, \No, he [Clinton] did not ask Gore to take over a failed foreign policy, as alleged, but to improve public presentations by his troika of bad talkers: shy National Security Adviser Tony Lake, boring Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and disorganized Defense Secretary Les Aspin.\ [Branch, 92] ➢ In one-passage WJC talks about asking Gore to lead the independent review of Hazel OLeary and also having Gore substitute for him at an economic conference in Japan. The latter did not fare well as other nations were offended that Gore, not WJC attended. Gore insisted that WJC needed to go to Japan to redeem himself and the administration for his absence. Gore pointed to a few days in January, but WJC \pronounced them vital to Chelsea's schoolwork. Gore blinked. So what?...Mutual exasperation spiked. `Al,' Clinton told him, 'I am not going to Japan and leave Chelsea by herself to take these exams.' Gore erupted. He thought Clinton had lost his bearing. They had a big fight, said the president, and were still wrangling about dates for Japan.\ Branch states that this fight wound up being around the time WJC saw Lewinsky. [Branch, 316-317] ➢ On page 396-397 there is a scene, which shows Gores sense of humor and Gore, WJC, et al working as a team to secure the Cabinet for the second term. ➢ Later there is a passage about an exchange between WJC and HRC about Gore trying to hire a second criminal lawyer. HRC already knew he was paying the first one $30,000 per month. The conversation is about a leak of an offer from Jim Neal of TN, the former Watergate prosecutor to defend Gore for free. The exchange is more on ethics of the offer and its leak to the press than about Gore. ➢ On Gores announcing his campaign. \The president had called twice to congratulate Gore for his kickoff events—once from Geneva, hours later from Paris. Clinton thought the only glitches were technical... But Gore got all the big things right. His twofold message was perfect: distinguish himself from Clinton's personal flaws, and tell voters exactly what he would do for them in the White House. The president said it was fine for Gore to call Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky 'inexcusable.' First, it was true. Second, it showed a necessary strength to criticized the boss. Third, Gore would be badgered to death until he did. 'Al,' Clinton told him, 'if you thought it would help in the campaign, I would let you flog me at noon right on the doorstep of the Washington Post.'\ [Branch, 553-554] Branch continues that WJC told Gore to ignore reporting that he was offended or critical of his campaign. \On tape, the president said he confided his chief strategic worry only to Gore himself and to Gore's pollster, Mark Penn. The vice president must project his platform—where he stood, precisely how and where he would lead the country—because the Republicans would try to knock him off substance.\ [Branch, 554] ➢ WJC offered critiques of Gores campaign throughout, but it was always framed as his fear of Gore not succeeding him. For example, \Clinton still thought Gore could win. Most people considered him smart, experience, and motivated. He examined the pitfalls for Gore in a campaign showcasing presidential character over detailed agendas for the country. Reporters called Gore \stiff,\ but Clinton discounted this liability. He thought Gores droll sense of humor would wear well over time. Gore also was perceived to be too conventional a Democrat, therefore lacking independence, which called for Gore to emphasize more his own passion and initiatives. Then the president said Gore could have a brooding quality about him, not worrisome or off-putting in itself, but potentially damaging if his serious nature failed to give voters a lifted. Clinton isolated the word \sunny.\ Gore needed more of it.\ [Branch, 599] ➢ He also complimented Gore's knowledge of government workings. \Gore knew Washington. Believe me, said the president, his administration would have made many more errors in the first two years had it not been for the vice president.\ He then goes on to say that WJC suggested Gore find someone who would be a bright spot to run with, perhaps Durbin or Bradley or Kerrey, although he also goes into great detail about the virtues of Mikulski, even though she would never get chosen. How much of this was WJC's emphasis versus Branch's focus on his home state senator is unclear. [Branch, 599, 618-19] ➢ WJC criticized Gore for not running on the successes of the administration. \They should be running essentially for a third term, said the president, but they were afraid the Clinton-Gore record would tarnish them with Clintons character.\ [Branch, 623] Branch gives WJCs critique of Gore in debate that had been heard before—that Gore lacked style and a light touch. ➢ Branch has WJC recalling a conversation between WJC and Gore where \Gore had bared himself in one of their stressful consultations by insisting that he, Gore, was a good politician, elaborating that he meant good on the policy, and also good on the politics, but admitted that he did not instinctively blend the two. Gore said he had to think about it, and Clinton thought this was pretty close to the bone...He had the stuff to be a great president, and this was the message that Clinton must convey somehow without seeming to brag on his own record.\ [Branch, 623-624] ➢ The big passage about Gore begins on page 641 and extends to 645. Branch notes that WJC was unsure at first about recording the details. At the outset it says, \For his own part, Gore was not angry, nor did he blame Clinton for his defeat, but he wanted to acknowledge forthrightly that some people around him did.\ [Branch, 642] It has WJC acknowledging that Gores use of him was proper—he was best in the White House. Then he says, \I think you made a mistake not to use me more in the last ten days,\ Clinton told Gore, but otherwise that was not a big deal. I was much more upset about your message, now that were being honest.\ [Branch, 642] Branch recalls WJC saying Gore fought bag saying that \Clintons drag plagued every direction.\ Clinton then said that Gore was better at governance than Clinton, and Gore would be better for the nation than Bush, and that he was an \unparalleled\ vice president, but that he had \blind spots.\ Branch writes that WJC kept saying their confrontation was \surreal.\ o Gore had a \fresh grievance...he wanted Clinton to know that the Buddhist temple fund-raising scandal had been the worst experience of his life. No one had ever questioned his personal integrity, but corrosive publicity and whispers had tormented him now for four years. Gore said he had not been disposed to blame Clinton. However, he remembered telling the president that he found himself the only English-speaking person at one of those Asian fund-raisers. And the president was in charge of the party apparatus that was supposed to screen all the donations for trouble. So he did blame Clinton in a way. The president told me he could scarcely believe the ensuing tales of suspicion. Gore must still be in shock from the election, or unhinged. I thought he was in Neverland, he said.\ [Branch, 643-644] o Branch continues: \The vice president asked Clinton about Monica Lewinsky. He had supported Clinton all through the impeachment, publicly and privately, while declaring himself disappointed. Yes, said the president. He appreciated that. However, persisted Gore, Clinton did not confide any personal feelings. He never explained exactly what happened. There was little to say, Clinton replied, beyond failure and regret. He was humiliated and angry, had made mistake. He had misled the American people, and he was sorry. Gore closed his point with emphasis. Well, he said, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally. Clinton did a double take...Gore treated the confession as a watershed. Their colliding perspectives made both of them angry. Clinton exploded that Gores reaction was phony. What was so significant here?...Gore exploded back. He was feeling a stubborn repeat of the defensiveness and delayed honesty that somehow cost the election. Clintons character was at the root of it...\ [Branch, 644-45] Other ➢ Maggie as Person Recommending Panetta: Unlike in My Life, in Branchs book, it has WJC asking Maggie to compile confidential suggestions for McLartys replacement. \Williams was shrewd, discreet, and efficient.\ [Branch, 161] > HRC and Haiti Invasion: Branch asked WJC what HRC thought about his foreign policy teams suggestion to invade Haiti. \He said the pell-mell rush to invade was crazy to her. Reacting against the pressure, the lack of options, and his sense of being trapped, she said he was badly served by his foreign policy staff. He said she observed with some suspicion that the chief sponsors of the invasion—Lake, Berger, and Talbott—were the same people who had pushed the ill-fated appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as defense secretary.\ [Branch, 189] > ITAV: ITAV co-author flap in which Sally Quinn spread rumors that HRC had not written the book. Quinn said that HRC had denied credit to the books collaborator, Barbara Feinman, a friend of Quinn. HRC said Feinman had withdrawn from the project. Branch notes that the White House had draft chapters in HRCs handwriting. (Branch turned this to be about him and how it affected him as a ghostwriter.) From this HRC said that Quinn and her friends launched a rumor that HRC and a female veterinarian of Socks were \discovered...in flagrante on a bedroom floor in the White House.\ [Branch, 342-343] > Subpoenas of CVCs Friends: Branch tells of how DAmato, as Chair of the Banking Committee, had subpoenaed all those who might have been in the White House when HRCs Rose firm records were there. This included \some two dozen of Chelsea's sleepovers.\ Senator Sarbanes quashed the subpoenas for the sleepovers. [Branch, 362] ➢ Vernon Jordan Extramarital Sex: In the context of Lewinsky, Branch says of Vernon Jordan, \In our glancing associations, I had picked up from Vernon an attitude toward extramarital sex best described as lighthearted or recreational.\ [Branch, 495] > Gore/HRC ticket: \By the numbers, and Clinton's gut, a Gore-Hillary ticket would give Democrats their best chance to defeat Bush for the White House. 'Hands down,' he [WJC] said, tut I don't think Al would ever do it.'\ [Branch, 540] > WJC suggesting Rubin run for NY Senate seat: The passage comes after WJC talks about supporting HRC if she decided to run, which raises a question of whether he had preferred Rubin or whether the two events are unconnected. \When the president had urged him [Rubin] to run for and easily win the New York Senate seat, Rubin recoiled...He could not fathom why Hillary wanted to run now...\ [Branch, 557] ➢ On trip to South Asia: Branch says that WJC agreed to cancel a stop in Bangladesh, because \of hard intelligence that Osama bin Laden had lined the route with assassins.\ [Branch, 594] My Life discusses the cancelled trip but does not specify it was because of bin Laden or assassins. DI Gephardt is an asshole,\ Hillary commented. The president, pointing to my recorders, advised gently that the tapes were on. She winced but shrugged with a smile. \Well, he is,\ she insisted. In an awkward silence, I backed up both machines to erase the first ladys epithet.\ [Branch, 263]

C05776654	sbwhoeop Friday, December 3, 2010 9:55 AM H: Roger Cohen in NYT: \American Diplomacy Revealed — as Good\ http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03iht-edcohen.html?hp December 2, 2010 American Diplomacy Revealed as Good By ROGER COHEN NEW YORK — Let's hear it for the men and women of the U.S. Foreign Service! They are, to judge from the WikiLeaks dump of a quarter-million of their private or secret cables, thoughtful, well-informed and dedicated servants of the American interest who write clear, declarative English sentences. I've not heard much in the torrent of Wiki-chatter about these admirable career diplomats whose diplomacy is now condemned to be unquiet. Yet it is they whose lives have been upturned. Every journalist knows that if their correspondence over several years was suddenly made public, they would lose most of their sources. That should give every journalist pause. So it will be on the front line of U.S. diplomacy. Contacts will self-censor. They will go quiet, particularly in the more conspiratorial parts of the world which also tend to be the most unstable, like the Middle East. Layers of secrecy will be added. Julian Assange, the thin-skinned founder of WikiLeaks, has hurt U.S. interests across a broad but probably shallow spectrum. That will satisfy him in that he's a self-styled foe of the United States. The guy makes me queasy. Perhaps the most shocking thing about the Assange treasure trove — beyond the \shock\ of venal Gulf Arab Sunni leaders looking for war on the cheap against Shiite Iran so long as it doesn't disrupt their U.S.-armed fiefdoms; or the \shock\ of Pakistani double-dealing and nuclear procrastination; or the \shock\ of yet more premature Israeli predictions on when Iran will have a nuclear weapon; or the \shock\ of continued Saudi funding of Al Qaeda; or the \shock\ of the Chinese Politburo hacking into Google; or the \shock\ of Muammar el-Qaddafi's taste for voluptuous Slavic women and Silvio Berlusconi's taste for all women — perhaps the biggest shock of all is just how professional, sober and short on embarrassment all these cables are and just how much they conform with the world as we already knew it, right down to the familiar adjectives evoking French President Nicolas Sarkozy: \hyperactive,\ \mercurial,\ \authoritarian,\ \erratic,\ \monarch-like.\ I swear, if they hadn't become diplomats a lot of these State Department people could have become good hacks. Overall, my longstanding admiration for America's conscientious diplomats has been redoubled, not least for this underreported nugget on the turbulent Iranian election of 2009, contained in a cable of Jan. 12, 2010, from Dubai: \While we dont know nor might not ever know the real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record high levels and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad won big in the first round.\ It is good to know that this is the innermost conviction of American diplomacy: the fraud was evident to anyone in Tehran during the election and its violent aftermath. A couple more observations on Iran: The first is that the Sunni autocrats of the Gulf are as exercised as they are about Tehran in part because they know that any U.S.-Iranian breakthrough might make them more dispensable to the United States. Their vested interest in the prevailing Middle Eastern strategic equation is strong; nothing would redraw the Middle East more than overcoming the U.S.-Iranian psychosis. The second is that President Barack Obamas approach to Iran has been much more conventional than his initial outreach suggested. Old habits of attempted coercion trumped originality. Very quickly he fell back on Dennis Rosss tired thinking about balancing \appetizing carrots\ with \sharp sticks\ in tackling Irans nuclear program. The cables reveal that as early as March 2009, a senior U.S. diplomat was talking \dual track,\ telling Europeans that \engagement alone is unlikely to succeed\ and calling for added \pressure.\ Perhaps Iranian skepticism could never have been overcome; certainly this approach guaranteed longstanding Iranian grievances would fester. Assange himself clearly understands nothing of Iran or the Middle East or diplomacy. In an interview with Time, he expressed approval for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \coming out with a very interesting statement that leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can\ and bought into Netanyahus view that this, in Assanges words, would \lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation to Iran. It Huh? Netanyahu was referring to Arab leaders' now-documented private calls for a U.S.-led war against Iran, an option he also favors. And that, for Assange, is a step forward to peace! He's all over the place. What should we make of this brainy naïf who told my colleague John Burns that America is a threat to democracy? He's a loose canon; let him be. My impression is he's self-armed with a spade and he's digging. And what of the messenger's message? The cables are intriguing, offering plenty of voyeuristic titillation but no gasp of discovery. They provide texture but break little new ground. Yet their publication has done significant damage to the courageous work of America's diplomats and may endanger lives. That's a tradeoff that I find troubling and unpersuasive.

Statement on the Attack in Benghazi September 11, 2012 I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today. As we work to secure our personnel and facilities, we have confirmed that one of our State Department officers was killed. We are heartbroken by this terrible loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack. This evening, I called Libyan President Magariaf to coordinate additional support to protect Americans in Libya. President Magariaf expressed his condemnation and condolences and pledged his government's full cooperation. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind. In light of the events of today, the United States government is working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions, and American citizens worldwide. Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya September 12, 2012 It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel in Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues. A 21 year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi. I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger. Sean Smith was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago.

Prior to arriving in Benghazi, he served in Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal, and most recently The Hague. All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future. America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by the service of each and every one of them. Remarks on the Deaths of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya September 12, 2012 Yesterday, our U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya was attacked. Heavily armed militants assaulted the compound and set fire to our buildings. American and Libyan security personnel battled the attackers together. Four Americans were killed. They included Sean Smith, a Foreign Service information management officer, and our Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. This is an attack that should shock the conscience of people of all faiths around the world. We condemn in the strongest terms this senseless act of violence, and we send our prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those we've lost. All over the world, every day, America's diplomats and development experts risk their lives in the service of our country and our values, because they believe that the United States must be a force for peace and progress in the world, that these aspirations are worth striving and sacrificing for. Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the best traditions of a bold and generous nation. In the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed in marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more friends to mourn. Chris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined the Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people's hopes his own. In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his sister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Sean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to Benghazi. The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking — indeed, I asked myself— how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be. But we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group — not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded. Libyans carried Chris' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible. The friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America's interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies, consulates, and citizens. There will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear — there is no justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially difficult that this happened on September I I th. It's an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya September 13, 2012 The attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four Americans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information Management Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died helping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated military veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and deepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our critical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and Glen. Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him \Rone,\ and they relied on his courage and skill, honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few months ago. We also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an experienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived — with selfless honor and unstinting valor. We condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are taking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the world. This violence should shock the conscience of people of all faiths and traditions. We appreciate the statements of support that have poured in from across the region and beyond.

Remarks at the Opening Plenary of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue September 13, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues from Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department for this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to address the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with Morocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today. We are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and expect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into violence. I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly — and I hope it is obvious — that the United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its content and message. America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course, millions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith. To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there is no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence, We condemn the violence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in the United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue. Violence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other religions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that fundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to shed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against diplomatic missions. These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better understuiding across countries and cultures.

NO FOIA WAIVER. those spaces and people, because to attack an embassy is to attack the idea that we can work together to build understanding and a better future. Now, I know it is hard for some people to understand why the United States cannot or does not just prevent these kinds of reprehensible videos from ever seeing the light of day. Now, I would note that in today's world with today's technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were possible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our Constitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no matter how distasteful they may be. There are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and free expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in response to speech is not acceptable. We all — whether we are leaders in government, leaders in civil society or religious leaders — must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader should be standing up now and drawing that line. I wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this has been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the condolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat And even though that tragedy happened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco to the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans we lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a Peace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in the memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which riot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better future. In many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King Mohammed deserves great credit for the work you've undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat earlier this year. I told my team: \We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\ No country has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to recognize us back in 1777. But we're not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is longstanding We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me highlight a few of the areas we should focus on today. On political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and the Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of these changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other steps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working group will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate commitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people themselves feel the changes in their evetyday lives: the courts reformed, the government more U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

I'm especially pleased by Morocco's commitments to take on the deeply troubling problem of child marriage. We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face life-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only shortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we want to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on this issue. With regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a peaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has remained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco's autonomy plan is serious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We continue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work toward resolution. With respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to deliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco's economy is relatively healthy, but you face the same problem that is now endemic across the world — unemployment is still too high, especially among young people. That's why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effort to attract foreign investors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I'm pleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development conference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries. Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a particular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I'd like to increase the amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration across North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco's stability and Morocco's very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the benefits for Moroccans. Third, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through our work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco already share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global Counterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.

We are also collaborating through USAID, the Peace Corps, and other agencies to help provide Moroccan youth with alternatives to criminal and extremist organizations. And so we are partnering to help strengthen Morocco's criminal justice system and law enforcement. There will be a lot to discuss in the meeting today. And let me add, the United States greatly appreciates the constructive role Morocco is playing on the UN Security Council, especially your support for the effort to end the violence and bloodshed in Syria and help to usher in a new democratic future for that country. I commend Morocco for offering to host the next ministerial meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, and we look forward to continuing to work closely together as close partners even after your term on the Security Council has ended. Finally, our education and cultural ties are reason for much celebration. This year marks the 30th anniversary of our official program to facilitate academic exchanges and other bonds between us. There are more than 5,000 Moroccan alumni of these programs. Two are with us today — Dr. Benjelloun and Dr. Ouaouicha — and we thank them. But among all our work on this front, from preserving Morocco's historic sites to empowering youth, there's one area I particularly hope we can focus on today and receive your advice and counsel — namely, interfaith dialogue. In these tense and turbulent times, it's more important than ever for people of different faiths to exchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It's one of the great challenges of the 21st century, and it's one that we must address together. So we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty our nations signed in 1786 says, and I quote, \Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\ I'm confident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations stronger, more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same for the world. So again, let me welcome you, Minister. It's been a great pleasure for me to get to know you, to work with you, to be your colleague bilaterally, regionally, and globally, and also welcome your distinguished delegation. Thank you.

This comes during sad and difficult days for the State Department family. We lost four Americans. They were good and brave men. They were committed to the cause of building a brighter future for the people of Libya. And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in Benghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen. The Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the support that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this tragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our ambassador. Ambassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words? AMBASSADOR AMU: [redacted] SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very personal loss for you, as it was for me. I'm the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the revolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to bring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya. Religious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people. Hatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good will know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God in any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of whom have shown an outpouring of support during this time Unfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere. Some seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on the intemet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of that video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all prophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity. But both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out against violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack. Think about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to their faiths, and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same goes for all faiths, including Islam.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. When all of us who are people of faith - and I am one — feel the pain of insults, of misunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to resort to violence, That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone's obligation to meet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of others, You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence. And I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They have withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in one's faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one's faith is unshakable. So tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked by understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that whenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will answer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment, answering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits a violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength. In times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some mountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and peacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions of the world call us to pursue. But that's not what I believe, and I don't think it's what you believe either here tonight. Part of what makes our country so special is we keep trying. We keep working. We keep investing in our future. We keep supporting the next generation, believing that young people can keep us moving forward in a positive direction. So tonight I think it's important that we talk not just about that better tomorrow that we all seek, but also about some of the things — the real, practical, tangible things — that young people are doing to help shape that better future. Two years ago in this room, at our Eid reception, we launched a program called Generation Change to lead a grassroots agenda of positive engagement with Muslim communities. And I asked the young Muslim leaders in the audience that night to be our unofficial ambassadors, to help build personal connections, seek out partners in other countries. And I can report to you tonight they did not disappoint. In a few minutes, you're going to meet some of these young leaders, each with a powerful story to tell. The Generation Change network that started in this room now circles the globe. We are building an international alliance of young people who want to drive change in their own communities. They act as mentors, spark respectful debates, simply offer words of encouragement when needed. But most importantly, they inspire others to keep expanding the circle of mutual understanding and respect, one person at a time.

Even as we work to spread tolerance more broadly, we also are working to deepen our appreciation for the experiences of others. Our 2012 Hours Against Hate initiative encourages young people to put themselves in another person's shoes through service projects. So far, young people from all over the world have pledged thousands of volunteer hours to help people from a different background, to see them as a fellow human being, not a stereotype, not a caricature, but another real live person — people who don't look like you, live like you, pray like you, but with whom we will share this planet. And therefore, we have work to do. People of faith and conscience are called to be the leaders of tolerance. In my tradition, like all traditions, we are expected to love one another. And together, we have to translate that into better understanding and cooperation. I'm particularly pleased that the young people you will hear from tonight are really setting an example, not only for young people elsewhere in the world but, frankly, for us who are older as well. Let me now call to the stage someone who has been a tremendous assistance to me in these efforts. Farah Pandith is the Department's first Special Representative to Muslim Communities. And from the beginning, she has made reaching out to young people and civil society her top priority. Farah will introduce you to three young leaders who I am very proud of Remarks at the Transfer of Remains Ceremony to Honor Those Lost in Attacks in Benghazi, Libya September 14, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Chaplain. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Secretary Panetta, Ambassador Rice, Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell, family members of the four patriots and heroes we bring home, members of the State Department family, ladies and gentlemen, today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our values. To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and deepest gratitude. Sean Smith joined the State Department after six years in the Air Force. He was respected as an expert on technology by colleagues in Pretoria, Baghdad, Montreal, and The Hague. He enrolled in correspondence courses at Penn State and had high hopes for the future. Sean leaves behind a loving wife Heather, two young children, Samantha and Nathan, and scores of grieving family, friends, and colleagues. And that's just in this world. Because online in the virtual worlds that Sean helped create, he is also being mourned by countless competitors, collaborators, and garners who shared his passion. Tyrone Woods, known to most as Rone, spent two decades as a Navy SEAL, serving multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. Our hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy, and his three sons Tyrone, Jr., Hunter, and Kai, born just a few months ago, along with his grieving faii)ily, friends, and colleagues.

He too died as he lived, serving his country and protecting his colleagues. Glen deployed to some of the most dangerous places on Earth, including Iraq and Afghanistan, always putting his life on the line to safeguard other Americans. Our thoughts and prayers are with Glen's father Bernard, his mother Barbara, his brother Gregory, his sister Kathleen, and their grieving families, friends, and colleagues. I was honored to know Ambassador Chris Stevens. I want to thank his parents and siblings, who are here today, for sharing Chris with us and with our country. What a wonderful gift you gave us. Over his distinguished career in the Foreign Service, Chris won friends for the United States in far-flung places. He made those people's hopes his own. During the revolution in Libya, he risked his life to help protect the Libyan people from a tyrant, and he gave his life helping them build a better country. People loved to work with Chris. And as he rose through the ranks, they loved to work for Chris. He was known not only for his courage but for his smile — goofy but contagious — for his sense of fun and that California cool. In the days since the attack, so many Libyans — including the Ambassador from Libya to the United States, who is with us today — have expressed their sorrow and solidarity. One young woman, her head covered and her eyes haunted with sadness, held up a handwritten sign that said \Thugs and killers dont represent Benghazi nor Islam,\ The President of the Palestinian Authority, who worked closely with Chris when he served in Jerusalem, sent me a letter remembering his energy and integrity, and deploring — and I quote — \an act of ugly terror.\ Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments. This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. Weve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. Weve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful interne video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable. The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts. And we will, under the Presidents leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world. There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we dont lose sight of the fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world. We owe it to those four men to continue the long, hard work of diplomacy. I am enormously proud of the men and women of the State Department. Im proud of all those across our government, civilian and military alike, who U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

They help make the United States the greatest force for peace, progress, and human dignity the world has ever known. If the last few days teach us anything, let it be this: That this work and the men and women who risk their lives to do it are at the heart of what makes America great and good. So we will wipe away our tears, stiffen our spines, and face the future undaunted. And we will do it together, protecting and helping one another, just like Sean, Tyrone, Glen, and Chris always did. May God bless them and grant their families peace and solace, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. And now, let me have the great honor of introducing someone who came to the State Department earlier this week to grieve with us. He well understands and values the work that these men were doing for our country. The President of the United States. Remarks With Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Patricia Espinosa After Their Meeting September 18, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And it is such a pleasure for me to welcome my friend and colleague, Secretary Espinosa, along with a very distinguished delegation of officials from the Mexican Government for this continuation of consultation at the highest levels of each of our governments. Before I turn to the matters discussed today, let me give a brief update on the ongoing U.S. response to the protests in the Middle East and elsewhere. Im sure as you know already, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our staffs in embassies and consulates worldwide. That includes reviewing our security posture at every post and augmenting it where necessary. And we are working closely with the Libyan Government in our efforts to bring to justice those who murdered our four American colleagues in Benghazi. The FBI is now in Tripoli to join the investigation with Libyan officials, and there is nothing more important to us than ensuring the safety of our American representatives worldwide. At the same time, as I have said to State Department employees, the incidents of the past week highlight how important our work is. The United States must and will remain strongly engaged in the world. Our men and women risk their lives in service to our country and our values, because they know that the United States must be a force for peace and progress. That is worth striving and sacrificing for, and nothing that happened last week changes this fundamental fact. Now, turning to our friends and partners in Mexico, we are always pleased to have a chance to discuss matters of mutual interest and concern between us. Mexico is one of our closest friends as well as partner on dozens of critical issues. So we talk about every kind of issue you can imagine, from education and healthcare to poverty alleviation to the environment. But today, we focused on a top priority for us both a security.

This is the last one we will hold during the Calderon Administration. And I want to offer my personal appreciation to President Calderon and to Foreign Secretary Espinosa for their leadership and commitment to this partnership and to all on both sides of the border in our governments who have been deeply engaged and committed to it. The Merida Initiative represents an unprecedented level of security cooperation between Mexico and the United States. As our countries continue to deal with the serious challenge of transnational criminal organizations, including drug traffickers, illegal arms traffickers, money launderers, and violent gangs that threaten people on both sides of the border, we well know there is no quick and easy way to stop these criminals and bring them to justice. But nevertheless, during the past now nearly four years, our countries have collaborated to an extraordinary and unprecedented degree. We have brought together policy makers and experts from across our governments and societies who have worked hand in hand to keep our people safe. And I think the habits of cooperation we have built are among our most important achievements, and we will rely on them for a long time to come. Today, our delegations reviewed the gains weve made on key priorities, including improving law enforcement coordination, reducing the demand for drugs, modernizing our border infrastructure, strengthening the rule of law, and building more resilient and empowered communities. We also discussed the lessons weve learned and the work that lies ahead in these and other areas, which our joint statement will reflect. I want to underscore how important our security relationship with Mexico is to the United States. The Government of Mexico and the Mexican people have faced the threat posed by these criminals with courage and resolve, and we remain committed to doing everything we can to support Mexico as it continues to work to bring those criminals to justice. This is a transnational problem, and it calls for a transnational solution, and the United States believes this is a matter of shared responsibility. That was the first message I brought as Secretary of State when I came to Mexico, and it continues to be the hallmark of our efforts together. Making sure our people are safe and our neighbors are safe is of the utmost importance to us. Now, our two countries share many other priorities, and one of them, empowering women and girls, was also addressed today. We took the opportunity, the Foreign Secretary and I, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between our countries to work together to advance gender equality, empower girls and women, promote their human rights, and enhance their security. So again, Secretary Espinosa, let me thank you for years of work and effort, for our productive conversations in many places around the world and again today, and for being such a valuable colleague and partner. The United States deeply, deeply values our relationship with Mexico and the ties of family and friendship that connect so many millions of our people.

We believe strongly that presidential administrations may change, elections will come and go, but we have established a firm foundation for cooperation that has already benefited both our countries and which will continue to benefit both of our countries for many years ahead. So thank you very much. MS. NULAND: Well take (inaudible). Margaret Brennan, CBS News. QUESTION: Madam Secretary, thanks for your time. Are you any closer to finding who killed Ambassador Chris Stevens?, Libyas President says this attack was planned for months. Are you confident hes wrong and that security measures were appropriate? And will you leave justice to the Libyans? SECRETARY CLINTON: As I said at the outset, we are taking aggressive steps to protect our people and our consulates and embassies around the world. We are reviewing our security posture at every post and working with host governments to be sure they know what our security- needs are wherever necessary. We are also working closely with the Libyan Government to bring the perpetrators to justice so that we can be assured that we have found who murdered our four, colleagues and under what circumstances. As I said, the FBI has joined the investigation inside Libya, and we will not rest until the people who orchestrated this attack are found and punished. It is also important to look at this strategically and understand what is going on across the region. In a number of places where protests have tuned violent, we are seeing the hand of extremists who are trying to exploit peoples inflamed passions for their own agendas. But overwhelmingly, we have found that the people of Egypt, of Libya, of Yemen and Tunisia are not prepared to trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob. They want to turn their attention to the future to provide better opportunities for themselves and their children, and they want a strong partnership with the United States and the American people based on mutual interests and mutual respect. This is part of a larger debate that is going on inside these societies. In Libya, for example, in their first free elections, moderates were successful at the polls. But look, there are extremists in all of these societies and on the outside who are working to take advantage of broad outrage in order to incite violence and specifically incite violence against Americans and American facilities. And as I have said to many of the leaders I have spoken to over the past week, these extremist efforts are a threat to the people of the societies and the governments of those societies as well as to the region and the United States. And I think its important at this moment for leaders to put themselves on the right side of this debate - to speak out clearly and unequivocally against violence, whoever incites it or conducts it And in a struggle like this, there can be no doubt where the United States must stand. We support those who are fighting for the same values and rights that we believe in - in democracy, in U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

And I want to underscore that the United States will continue to work with partners and allies in the region and around the world to help bring security to these nations so that the promise of the revolutions that they experienced can be realized. And finally, on your specific point about Benghazi, we obviously never talk publicly about security at any of our missions for obvious reasons. But that said, let me assure you that our security in Benghazi included a unit of host government security forces, as well as a local guard force of the kind that we rely on in many places around the world. In addition to the security outside the compound, we relied on a wall and a robust security presence inside the compound. And with all of our missions overseas, in advance of September lid, as is done every year, we did an evaluation on threat streams. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has said we had no actionable intelligence that an attack on our post in Benghazi was planned or imminent. But let me state the obvious again. Our diplomats engage in dangerous work, and its the nature of diplomacy in fragile societies and conflict zones to be aware of the necessity for security but to also continue the important diplomatic work that has to go on. There is risk inherent in what we do and what these brave men and women representing the United States are up against every single day, and we do our very best to limit that risk by ensuring that our security protocols reflect the environments in which diplomats work and the threats that they are presented with. Thank you. Remarks With Indonesian Foreign Minister Raden Mohammad Marty Muliana Natalegawa After Their Meeting September 20, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good afternoon, everyone. And its such a pleasure, as always, to welcome the Indonesian Foreign Minister, and I believe the largest delegation that has ever come from Indonesia, for the purpose of our third meeting of the U.S.-Indonesia Joint Commission. This commission is the result of a vision by our two presidents for a comprehensive partnership, and the agreement to that effect was signed in 2010. Thanks to this partnership, the United States and Indonesia are working more closely than ever on a range of issues from global security to clean energy and climate to regional trade and commerce. And today, Marty and I had the chance to take stock of where our teams have come in the time of the last year, because we liad our meeting in Bali a year ago. And I must say, I was very impressed. We covered a great deal today. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. But before I start, Id like to say a few words about the protests in several countries around the world. We have condemned in the strongest possible terms the violence that has erupted from these protests. And as I have said, the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States Government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it. But there is no justification for violence, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and his government for speaking out against violence. We have to look to reasonable people and responsible leaders everywhere to stand up to extremists who would seek to take advantage of this moment to commit violent acts against embassies and their fellow countrymen. Todays meetings have highlighted the strong foundation that we have built together. And one of our most important concerns is promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific. Today, Im announcing that the Obama Administration has informed Congress of the potential sale of eight AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters to the Indonesian Government. This agreement will strengthen our comprehensive partnership and help enhance security across the region. On growth and prosperity, we are increasing our trade relationship that topped $26 billion last year. Investments in transportation, energy, and infrastructure are creating jobs and supporting economic growth in both countries. For example, the deal between Lion Air and Boeing alone represents $21 billion in trade over the next decade. Indonesias Government has announced half a trillion dollars in infrastructure improvements, and we recently signed a memorandum of understanding to make it easier for American companies to bid on these projects. And yesterday, we signed an agreement for implementing our Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact with Indonesia. Over the next five years, the United States will invest $600 million in clean energy development, child health and nutrition programs, and efforts to help make Indonesias Government more transparent and open. The United States is also looking forward to Indonesia hosting APEC in 2013, and we are confident that Indonesia will come to this role with a commitment to promote greater economic integration across the Asia Pacific. Both the Foreign Minister and I believe that strong education is essential to compete in a modem global economy. Thats why the United States has expanded the Fulbright Program and supported partnerships between dozens of American and Indonesian universities. Academic exchanges between our countries are up and applications from Indonesian students to visit the United States have increased by one third. USAID has recently expanded its basic education program to provide $83 million for teacher training and literacy programs for young children. And were providing $20 in scholarship funding for Indonesian graduate students.

The Foreign Ministers personal leadership has helped lay the groundwork for diplomacy between ASEAN and China as it relates to the South China Sea. And we continue to support ASEANs six-point principles, which we believe will help reduce tensions and pave the way for a comprehensive code of conduct for addressing disputes without threats, coercion, or use of force. Finally. Indonesia and the United States have stood together on a range of global challenges, from democratic reform in Burma to combating climate change, to working to end the violence in Syria. We are also coordinating efforts to further develop south-south and triangular cooperation, such as enhancing disaster preparedness in Burma and convening a conference on womens empowerment. We believe that as the second and third-largest democracies in the world, the United States and Indonesia have a special responsibility to promote democracy and human rights. And for the last four years, Indonesia has hosted the Bali Democracy Forum to promote peaceful, democratic transitions through example and open dialogue. Last year, more than 80 countries attended. And once again, the United States will be sending a high-level delegation. So, Minister, thank you for everything. Thank you for the great partnership weve had between us and between our countries. MS. NULAND: Well take two questions today, well start with Ros Jordan of Al Jazeera English. QUESTION: Thank you, Madam Secretary, Mr. Foreign Minister. Madam Secretary, my question is about the ongoing investigation into last weeks attack at the consulate in Benghazi. You are meeting this afternoon with members of Congress to discuss the progress and the concerns that they understandably have. First, there is the federal mandate to establish an accountability review board. Have you done so? Who would you like to see chair it? Are there certain questions that you desperately want to have answered in order to safeguard the safety of Foreign Service Officers around the world? And related to this, given the political instability and the successes of the past year and a half, are you satisfied that in light of those political changes, enough was done to protect those working in the Middle East and North Africa? And then finally — and this is perhaps going into the area of rumor and speculation — but there is at least one report suggesting that Ambassador Stevens felt that he was on a, quote, \al-Qaida hit list\ Is this a scurrilous rumor? Is this gallows humor when one is working in a period of difficulty and great challenge, or is there something more to what he allegedly — and I stress that word — said?

I will be briefing in two separate sessions, the House and the Senate, in a classified setting, along with my interagency colleagues, as we continue to work together, and with governments around the world, to ensure that our people and our facilities are safe. I will be joined today by the Director of National Intelligence, General Clapper, by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Sandy Winnefeld, along with experts from the FBI, the State Department, and elsewhere in the government. Now, I anticipate that this briefing will cover our security posture before and during the events, and the steps we have taken since to do everything we can with host governments to protect our people and our embassies and consulates. The Director of National Intelligence will speak to the intelligence issues surrounding these events in Libya. Deputy Secretary Carter will brief on the superb support we have had from the U.S. military in the wake of these events, and we are at the very early stages of an FBI investigation. The team from the FBI reached Libya earlier this week. And I will advise Congress also that I am launching an accountability review board that will be chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering. I will also talk about the importance of the broader relationships with these countries in light of the events of the past days. There are obviously very real challenges in these new democracies, these fragile societies, but as I said last week, the vast majority of the people in these countries did not throw off the tyranny of a dictator to trade it for the tyranny of a mob. And we are concerned first and foremost with our own people and facilities, but we are concerned about the internal security in these countries because ultimately, that puts at risk the men, women, and children of these societies on a daily ongoing basis if actions are not taken to try to restore security and civil order. And let me just conclude by saying that there can be no doubt where the United States stands. We continue to support those who are fighting for universal values — values that we see at work in Indonesia — the third largest democracy in the world. We believe that these values of universal rights, of justice and accountability, of democracy, are there for every person regardless of where that person might live. So I will look forward to having a chance to talk with members of Congress. As to your final question, I have absolutely no information or reason to believe that theres any basis for that. QUESTION: Thank you. MS. NULAND: Last question. Victoria Sidjabat from Tempo Magazine, please. QUESTION: Yes. Madam, thank you.

Madam Clinton, how do you see this threat as on the long run? If its continuing happen, its — obviously could give impact to the implementation of (inaudible) program in Indonesia. What is the reason U.S. Government closed the Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia? What is your expectation from Indonesia Government, for my Minister Marty Natalegawa? How Indonesia Government respond to the closing of this Embassy and Consulate, its starting today? Is U.S. — Indonesia Government has capability to protect U.S. Embassy and Consulate. So the (inaudible) program implemented — could be implemented successfully in Indonesia. Thank you. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, let me begin by saying how grateful we are for the excellent cooperation we have received from the Government of Indonesia, and in particular, from the law enforcement and security institutions in Indonesia. We are very grateful for not only the cooperation and protection that has been provided to our facilities, but also to the strong statements condemning violence from the President, the Foreign Mihister, and others. In consultation with the Government of Indonesia, we have temporarily, for tomorrow, closed our facilities. We want to be sure that law enforcement in Indonesia has the ability to do what it needs to do to make sure that there is no disruption of civil order and security. So we are cooperating completely, and were very grateful for the strong leadership provided by Indonesia. FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Hello, (inaudible), if I may just also respond. Precisely as the Secretary had said, the decision by the United States Government to close temporarily its embassies and consulates tomorrow in Indonesia is a decision thats been made based on communication and conversation between the authorities in Indonesia and the United States as well. So in other words, it is an informed decision, a decision that is not intended to show any unfriendly intent on the part of anyone, but it is what it is, and its quite some — its the kind of step that governments actually carry out when situations requires it, even in our case. Some of our embassies abroad, when the situation requires us to have a temporary closing of the embassy, we do that as well. So it is something that is quite regular and something that is actually coordinated as well. But if I may just broaden the subject matter, I think as our President had said in the past, Indonesian Government the Indonesian people, even, obviously cannot and would not condone the — any acts of violence against diplomatic premises, against diplomatic personnel, because that is, truly — would be a challenge to the efficient and a proper conduct of relations among states. So thats our point of departure. At the same time, of course, beyond the immediate issue of protection of the embassies, we have still ahead of us the challenge of how to prevent the kind of situations where we are now at in U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

So we have a lot of homework to work towards in the future as well. SECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you all very much. FOREIGN MINISTER NATALEGAWA: Thank you. Remarks With Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar Before Their Meeting September 21, 2012 Good afternoon, and let me begin by welcoming Foreign Minister Khar on her first visit to Washington as foreign minister. Weve had the opportunity to meet in Islamabad and other settings, but I am very pleased that we would have this chance to exchange views on our bilateral relationship as well as regional and global issues. I want to begin by addressing the events of the day and the past week. Today, weve once again seen protests in several cities in Pakistan. Unfortunately, some of those protests have turned violent and, sadly, resulted in loss of life. I want to thank the Government of Pakistan for their efforts to protect our Embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi. And I want to be clear, as I have said on numerous occasions, the violence we have seen cannot be tolerated. There is no justification for violence. Of course, there is provocation, and we have certainly made clear that we do not in any way support provocation. We found the video thats at the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible. But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own extremist ideologies. Yesterday afternoon when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans. And we are taking aggressive measures at all of our posts to protect our staffs and their families along with locally employed people who provide so many important contributions to the work of our missions. The Foreign Minister and I will have a chance to cover a full range of subjects today, and it is no secret that the past year and a half has been challenging for Pakistan and the United States. And we still have work to do to get our bilateral relationship to the point where we would like it to be, but we both recognize that we can achieve more when we work together on a focused agenda. So U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. today is the latest in a series of high-level meetings. Ambassador Marc Grossman has just returned from consultations in Islamabad. I look forward to seeing President Zardari next week at the UN General Assembly. At each meeting, we are working to identify the strategic goals we share — and there are many — and the concrete actions we can each take to accomplish them. Our number one shared priority remains pursuing our joint counterterrorism objectives to ensure the security of American and Pakistani citizens alike. We face a common threat from a common enemy, and we must confront terrorism and extremism together. Earlier this month, I designated the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization so we could make full use of every available legal authority to end their deadly attacks. Pakistans parliament has called for expelling foreign fighters so that Pakistans territory can be fully under control of the Pakistani Government and cannot be used to launch attacks against other nations. And the follow-through on this is challenging but necessary, and we look forward to working with Pakistan as they continue to address these problems. We have both pledged to support a secure, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan, which is vital for the security of the region. And I want to thank Foreign Minister Khar for Pakistans reopening of the NATO supply lines to allow the movement of goods to Afghanistan. We will discuss the successful first meeting of the Safe Passage Working Group in Islamabad which brought together Afghan, Pakistani, and U.S. representatives to advance the peace process in Afghanistan. The Pakistani Governments public call for insurgents to come forward and talk with the Afghan Government was particularly important. We are ready to work together to build on these steps, and we will continue our discussions through bilateral consultations and the U.S.- Afghanistan-Pakistan Core Group. Now, of course, our relationship goes far beyond our shared security concerns, and today we will discuss the many other ways in which we work together, particularly to create economic opportunity for Pakistanis. Foreign Minister Khar and I agree that we need to shift our economic relationship from aid to trade and investment. We are working to help Pakistan attract more private sector investment. We hope to finalize a bilateral investment treaty soon. And weve created a Pakistan private investment initiative to help more of Pakistans small and medium sized companies get access to capital. Over the past few years, we have seen Pakistans civilian government begin to put down stronger roots. And if elections proceed as planned next year, it will mark the first time in Pakistans history that a civilian-led government has served its full term. The United States supports Pakistans economic development, and we have said many times that we want to see democracy succeed in Pakistan.

We also support Pakistans sovereignty, but we are clear that all sovereign nations carry certain obligations to protect the human rights of their citizens, to control their territory, to prevent threats to their neighbors and the international community. So we know that there is still much to be done, but I can assure the people of Pakistan that the United States remains committed to this important relationship and we are confident we can continue to move forward together one step at a time to reach our shared strategic objectives. Thank you very much. Remarks With Tunisian Foreign Minister Rank Abdessalem Before Their Meeting September 21, 2012 SECRETARY CLINTON: Good morning. I am pleased to welcome the Foreign Minister from Tunisia Im looking forward to our meeting, We obviously have a great deal to discuss, and I want to thank the Foreign Minister and the Government of Tunisia for their efforts over the last week to help secure our Embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis following the violent assaults of last Friday. We are monitoring events closely today. There is no higher priority for President Obama and myself than the safety of our people. Weve taken a number of steps around the world to augment security and to protect our personnel at diplomatic posts. And we are working closely with host governments in this effort. As I have said before and as is embodied in the Vienna Convention and other international agreements, all governments have the duty, the solemn duty, to defend diplomatic missions. They must be safe and protected places so that governments can exchange views and work on many important issues, and leaders across the world must stand up and be counted in rejecting violence and holding violent actors accountable. We are working closely with the Government of Tunisia They have assisted us in enhancing the security of our facilities. Weve also discussed with them the imperative of bringing to justice those responsible for these violent attacks. And we have offered and will continue to look for ways that we can assist the new Government of Tunisia in ensuring the rule of law throughout their country, first and foremost for the people of Tunisia themselves. We look forward to continuing to build our hew partnership with the Tunisian Government and people. Our relationship is built around the shared principles of all democracies — a commitment to nonviolence, to tolerance, and inclusivity for all people, and to upholding the rule of law. The Tunisian people have bravely put themselves on the road to democracy. They were the first of the Arab revolutions and they have made important progress in a very short period of time. They have worked too hard and sacrificed too much over too many years to see their progress hijacked at derailed by extremists with Ulric own a5,-. , ,encia. And those extreinists, not only in U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739812 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

Tunisia but in too many places around the world, look for opportunities to exploit this current situation or other situations, and all people and leaders must stand against them. So as the Tunisian Government takes steps to strengthen security and protect the Tunisian people and economy from extremism and violent agendas, the United States stands ready to help. We also are working closely with Tunisia on the broader shared threat of terrorism, including from groups like al-Qaida and its affiliates. So Minister, please know the United States remains committed to supporting Tunisia as you deal with this current situation, as you continue your democratic transition, and we want to be with you as you confront challenges and help seize opportunities together for the betterment of the future of Tunisia.

C05771506	FYI The Christian Science Monitor - CSMonitor.com War on terror: Obama softened the language, but hardened Muslim hearts The Obama administration's shift in counterterrorism language sought to bridge the divide with the Muslim world and soften Americans' fear of Islam. But the new rhetoric hasn't matched policy, and the unintended costs at home and abroad have been high. By Stuart Gottlieb posted October 14, 2010 at 9:58 am EDT New Haven, Conn. — One of the most defining aspects of the Obama administration's counterterrorism strategy has been its effort to change America's rhetorical approach to the threat of terrorism, particularly Islamic terrorism. \The language we use matters,\ President Obama told the Arabic satellite television station Al Arabiya in an interview during his first week in office. Scrubbed were George W. Bush-era terms like \war on terrorism,\ \radical Islam,\ and \jihadist.\The White House's 2010 National Security Strategy formally replaced the term \Islamic terrorism\ with \violent extremism.\ The purpose of the shift in semantics was two-fold. First, it aimed to repackage the fight against terrorism as a specific fight against Al Qaeda, not against Islamic extremism, which Mr. Obama believes contributed to a post-9/11 perception that America was \at war with Islam.\ Indeed, the new rhetoric has gone hand in hand with Obama's outreach to the Muslim world to build \a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest.\ Second, it was part of a broader effort to soften Americans' fear of Islamic terrorism, which Obama officials believe plays directly into the hands of extremists. Language change ineffective Now it is fair to ask whether Obama's use of language regarding terrorism has proven effective. Startling new polls suggest it hasn't. The first, by the Brookings Institution in Washington, shows that between May 2009 and May 2010 the number of Middle Eastern Arabs expressing optimism in Obama's approach toward their region dropped from 51 percent to just 16 percent, with those describing themselves as \discouraged\ by the Obama presidency rising from 15 percent to 63 percent. The second, by the Pew Research Center, shows that in August 2010 fewer Americans held a favorable view of Islam (30 percent) than five years earlier during the Bush administration (41 percent), with more Americans (35 percent) saying Islam encourages violence more than other religions (in 2002, it was 25 percent). These starkly negative trend lines suggest the limited utility of language in fighting terrorism. Yes, terrorism is a propaganda-fueled activity – an ongoing battle to win hearts and minds and attract new recruits to fight for the cause. And of course the language used in combating terrorism is vital – the counterproductive \smoke em out\ rhetoric of the Bush administration is a case in point. But if rhetoric does not match policy, or appears to discount or play down threats, the credibility – and thus effectiveness – of the overall counterterrorism strategy may be undermined. It appears the Obama administration has dug itself into just such a hole. Rhetoric doesnt match policy When looking beyond the nuanced language and appealing promises, what Muslims around the world see is an administration that has ramped up the war in Afghanistan; is killing scores of Muslim civilians with drone strikes; continues to hold more than 1,000 Muslim detainees in Guantanamo, Bagram, and other prisons; and maintains seemingly unconditional support of Israel. This is not to critique these policies, but to point out that they do not match the raised expectations of the Muslim world and have only muddled Obamas oft-stated goal of turning Muslims toward America and away from extremist movements. The price of downplaying the threat A large price is also being paid domestically for disconnected rhetoric. Despite maintaining nearly all of Bushs hard-line tactics — the USA Patriot Act, warrantless surveillance, indefinite detentions the White House has consistently played down the threat, even in the face of a clear uptick in terrorism activity. For example, following the failed 2009 Christmas Day airline bombing, Obama described the suspect as an \isolated extremist,\ despite his ties to Al Qaeda. And the administrations initial response to the failed May 2010 Times Square bombing by an American Muslim trained in Pakistan was to call it a \one-off event. Attorney General Eric Holder stated in congressional testimony that he believed these and other recent Islamic terror plots were unconnected, and unrelated to radical Islam. There is little doubt that the administrations unwillingness to speak candidly about Islamic terrorism has taken a toll on the publics trust. A Gallup poll released last month shows Americans favoring Republicans over Democrats on the issue of terrorism 55 percent to 31 percent — up from 49 percent to 42 percent last fall. Time to reverse the trend Obama entered office promising to fight a smarter and more effective war on terrorism, and in many ways he has. His instincts to maintain aggressive tactics while toning down inflammatory rhetoric were sound. Yet his administration seems to have overlearned a key lesson of the Bush years — that overstating the threat of terrorism has costs attached. So, too, does rhetoric that understates the threat, especially when detached from policy. It is not too late to reverse this troubling trend. The White House can begin by focusing less on overly reassuring rhetoric — which has not paid dividends at home or abroad — and more on a candid accounting of the threats faced and the policies employed to confront them.

And I know why Paul did so. The former president was here in Kentucky yesterday and in this state, as in many others, he is a far more potent and popular foe than President Barack Obama. On my first day working for The Huffington Post, I came back to Kentucky, where I began my career many years ago at the Courier-Journal. The people who run the University of Louisville Kentucky Author Forum wanted me to do an on-stage interview with a certain best-selling author who is also my new boss: Arianna Huffington. It was a tricky mix of professional incest and personal nostalgia, but the event worked out well and I also got a chance to play Kentucky reporter once again out in the state. I raced over to Lexington and here is the ground-level, outside-the-Beltway reality I witnessed: Like Voldemorts, Obamas is a name no one dares utter -- and that includes Clinton speaking to Democrats. At a sunny, noontime rally on the campus of the University of Kentucky in Lexington yesterday, the former president made a stirring, well-argued case for Democratic Senate candidate Jack Conway and for Democrats generally -- without once mentioning Obama and rarely mentioning the presidency. It was as though we suddenly had only two branches of government. To be fair, almost no one else at the one-hour rally mentioned the sitting president. And Kentucky is staunch Republican territory. \Were farther ahead in the generic ballot here than ever,\ GOP Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told me yesterday. \President Obama was never popular here, even at his peak.\ Still, the eerie invisibility of the president is a telling commentary on the Democrats' confused, divided and defensive predicament as they brace for the verdict of the voters on Election Day, Nov. 2. There was something odd -- and, if you're a Democrat, depressing -- about a former Democratic president avoiding any mention of his Democratic successor. Clinton sincerely wants to help out on the trail -- and certainly wants to avoid the accusation that he didn't try to help. But his travels have turned into a personal victory lap that often makes him -- not the candidate he's touting -- the center of attention. That was true here in Kentucky. The rally's mechanics were mostly handled by the Secret Service; more to the point, the final (and therefore top-billed) speaker wasn't Conway. It was Clinton. The Conway people didn't mind. They were glad to have him. Rail-thin but not frail, wearing a tweedy professorial sports coat and his signature rueful, knowing smile, Clinton was treated with a respect bordering on awe. His familiar mane of white hair, thinning now, was translucent in the sun, giving him an almost otherworldly look: the Sage from a Better Age. Clinton is beloved In Kentucky. He won the state twice. He speaks the local dialect, which contains Appalachian notes of working-class pride, suspicion of big shots and Baptist revivalism. But more than that -- and more than just in Kentucky -- Clinton's economic record (22.7 million jobs created, and he tends not to forget to mention the .7) looks spectacularly good in the context of what has followed. These days there is almost an Old Testament, milk-and-honey reverence for that economic record, at least as expressed by former Kentucky Sen. Wendell Ford. An old-school podium pounder, Ford -- stooped but still strong voiced at 86 -- talked of the former president in messianic terms. \Bill Clinton found us the path to gold!\ he shouted. The crowd of 2,000, most of them students, didn't laugh. They seemed to think he was right. How any of this helps Obama is far from clear; it isn't even clear that it helps many Democrats -- since they'd be joining the same Washington party that the current president ostensibly heads. But Clinton is all too happy to show Obama how it's done. As a campaigner and as president, Clinton's gift was his ability to untangle the knots of even the most complex policy issue and explain it in plain language to people suspicious of the powerful -- but eager not to be screwed by them or to be seen as dupes. Republicans and their corporate allies were out to shut down the few good things that government does for you, he said, in the name of balancing a budget that they themselves destroyed. \I gave you budget surpluses!\ Clinton said, as if this had been an act of personal beneficence. Knowing his audience, the former president focused on Pell Grants, and on a new program that allows graduates to pay back their loans over longer periods and at lower rates. Paul, he said, will try to take that new program away -- and, given the GOP's deliberate vagueness about spending cuts -- there is reason to think Clinton is right. Which is why Paul got personal today. Which means Clinton drew blood. Which means that he did what he came to do. Which means Obama will remain invisible, at least in Kentucky, at least for now, and probably for a long time to come. Ci

C05764289	sbwhoeop Tuesday, October 6, 2009 2:11 PM H Note from Joe Wilson... Sid Hillary: I'm passing on a note below from Joe Wilson. Sid Dear Madame Secretary, It was great to see you, albeit briefly, at the US —Africa business summit. Your speech spoke to the entire audience as I'm sure you felt from the response. I also appreciate your offer to meet with me the next time we are both in Washington and would like to take you up on it. I am now working with a serious American engineering and construction company, Symbion Power, that has been hugely successful in Iraq and Afghanistan (on fixed cost contracts). It specializes in power plants, substations and transmission towers and lines. It made its name in Iraq constructing transmission towers and pulling lines across al Anbar province at the height of the war there. Its business model is to partner with local companies and to train local employees to do the construction, maintenance and repair, and to provide the security. In Iraq and Afghanistan they established training centers and graduated over 3000 certified linemen. They partner with an American Lineman College in Idaho to provide the ed ucation and certification. We think the model is well adapted to Africa and have already begun work on a training center in Tanzania, where we will be bidding on all of the upcoming MCC financed power generation and distribution projects. I have asked Sid to pass a memory stick with a four minute video that explains what Symbion does and how it does it. I tell you all this, not to tout Symbion (about which I am very enthusiastic) but let you know that we are doing much of what you have been advocating in your public comments about human capacity development. The fact that we have been successful on fixed cost contracts also speaks to your criticism of American companies that have been milking the government with their cost plus contracts for the last nine years. Our goal is to demonstrate that an emphasis on developing local talent is not just the right thing to do but is also good business. I look forward to seeing you the next time I am in Washington. I know how precious your time is, and very much appreciate your generosity. With warm regards and best wishes. Joe

C05770819	HRC: Below is an oped on the National Security Strategy I wrote for tomorrow's Outlook. Unfortunately, they give it a horrible title, but I think the piece turned out alright. Best, Sandy By Samuel R. Berger Samuel R. Berger, chair of the global strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, served as national security advisor to President Clinton from 1997 to 2001. President Obama's National Security Strategy, released by the White House on Thursday, tackles a delicate but unavoidable question: How do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and a reordering of political power abroad? For some time now, it has been clear that the definition of U.S. national security strategy needs rethinking. The September 11 attacks, global economic crisis, cyber-terror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the Gulf underscore that the challenges America faces in 2010 have changed even from just a decade ago. And while America's military supremacy is certainly not at risk, new international arrangements - such as the shift from the G-7 club of powerful nations to the G-20, which incorporates emerging nations from China to Brazil - are needed so that the costs and benefits of a stable international order are shared. The United States cannot solve most global threats without others, nor should we bear the burden alone. Enter the National Security Strategy. In my experience, these congressionally mandated documents can easily become laborious and impenetrable, or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government. (Make sure you do right by Japan! Don't step on the Pentagon!) The challenge, which President Clinton insisted upon to me and his other advisers, is to provide a strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs administration decision makers up and down the line. It's not a blueprint for action, but a means to convey the president's principles and priorities. In Obama's case, the new sober and comprehensive 52-page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with past strategies in several key respects. But it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges - nuclear proliferation, terrorism and regional conflicts - for which the best response is a return to fundamentals. One such fundamental is the strength of our economy. At a time when the after-effects of a financial crisis and the fiscal burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended America, the administration makes a case for economic and technological renewal as a crucial underpinning of U.S. security. The president made this case in his West Point speech last weekend. \At no time in human history,\ he said, \has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained its military and political primacy.\ Another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation. By seeking strategic arms cuts with Russia, the president has returned to a long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration. And by convening a global summit on securing nuclear material this spring, Obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort started in 1991 when Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar first initiated a program to lock down nuclear materials. On terrorism, the strategy builds on the past, but breaks with it as well. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama each have deployed all of America's tools: military power, homeland defense, law enforcement, sanctions, intelligence and vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing. But the critical difference in the Obama strategy is that it rejects the Global War on Terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge. \This is not a global war against a tactic - terrorism - or a religion - Islam,\ the new strategy says. \We are at war with a specific network, al-Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates.\ This sharper focus avoids alienating many in the Muslim world, ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against al-Qaeda fight in Afghanistan and turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor, the Obama administration has restored a less provocative policy on the use of military force. In the 2002 national security strategy, President Bush articulated the rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking a U.N. resolution to invade Iraq. The new strategy restores the principles that have guided administrations for decades: the use of force should be a last resort, should weigh all the costs and benefits, and should have as much international support as possible. The administration reserves the right to act unilaterally - for example against al-Qaeda and its allies - but resurrects the principle President Clinton often described as \together where possible, alone where necessary.\ President Obama's critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like Iran and North Korea. The President sets forth his rationale: \to create opportunities to resolve differences, strengthen the international communitys support for our actions, learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes, and plainly demonstrate to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation.\ In the case of Iran, Washingtons outstretched hand has not resulted in Irans compliance. But attempts to engage have helped ensure that the worlds attention is focused on Irans intransigence rather than Washingtons refusal to negotiate. Without a doubt, there are gaps between principle and practice. Despite the Obama administrations stated goal of doubling exports in the next five years, it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia. And the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities. Sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress, but many of the true tests of this strategy lie ahead. In the strategys conclusions, the Obama administration evokes an even earlier era, calling for both political parties to restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the Cold War. Despite the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control, Central America and détente, nearly all American supported the containment of communism. In that same spirit, the administrations framework deserves broad bipartisan support. We can and should argue out our differences over detention of prisoners, methods to disarm dangerous states, how hard to push for democratic rights, or the costs of climate change legislation. But at the same time, we can rally around the overriding U.S. foreign policy goals spelled out in the strategy: renewing our economy at home to ensure leadership abroad; defeating al-Qaeda; succeeding in Afghanistan; preventing nuclear proliferation; curbing climate change; and promoting an international order of enlightened self-interest, economic prosperity and the fundamental values upon which America is based.

C05766293	Attached and below is the proposed final Retreat Agenda. The chief challenge I see is in having each bureau give 3 minutes on their top 3 priorities. I think it is worthwhile from the standpoint that this is the first time all will be together with the chance to see/meet and hear from everyone, but it will take time to hear from everyone. Ive broken it up into 2 sections of an hour each. Without these sections, the Retreat would breathe — with them its tight though I have left padding in each section. I also am holding a place for up front for Susan Rice to present if she comes — she has not rsvped. Please see below and attached and advise if there are other suggested changes.

C05769477	Madam Secretary, Jake mentioned that you asked for more information about a proposal made in 2005 for a global CT organization, and he asked me to find out a little about it. Below is some brief information on the proposal, which was made by Saudi Arabia: The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an international counterterrorism center \under the auspices of the UN.\ The purpose of the organization would be to, among other things, \develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States\ on a wide range of non- military counterterrorism issues, encourage the establishment of national and regional centers, and provide assistance to developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center, as conceived in 2005, would also allow national counterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences. This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA), but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to be interested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly, recently there have been discussions between the UN and Saudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UNs capacity to support implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and the different CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and have multilateral CT consultations wherever necessary. But S/CT mentioned that, if we were to move forward on S/CTs CFO idea, we would hope to work closely with the Saudis. Please let me know if you would like any further info. Thanks, Mike Michael H.

C05766177	See the story below. Consensus recommendation is that you call PR and MM tomorrow or Wednesday. Because we expect them both to go to the press after they speak with you, we believe it would be best for you to keep the calls at a very high level. Essentially: O Two months have passed since your trip to Belfast and youre checking in; • Youre concerned about the news reports; O You understand that there are substantive differences and frayed nerves, but you want to encourage all parties to take positive actions and avoid unhelpful ones; • You remain prepared to assist in any way — you are personally invested in seeing them work through to the completion of this process; • Declan is hard at work, but his efforts are hampered by the lack of progress and the public conflict You would be mostly in listening mode and wouldnt engage substantively on the issues that are dividing them — parades (Sinn Fein doesnt want to concede anything on parades without a date for devolution) and a date (DUP doesnt want to set a date until they get progress on parades). If youre amenable, we-can move forward and schedule the calls. Thanks, Jake

The chair asked for rebels to come forward and speak. Only one prominent person emerged, Charles Clarke, former Home Secretary and Blairite; the rest were a handful of about a half-dozen backbenchers. Their remarks about how Brown was bringing the party down were poorly received. The party, after all, was in no mood for breaking ranks and rewarding disloyalty. With this paltry showing, the opposition petered out, at least for now. Gordon then gave a speech, strong on analysis, discussing that his government was paying the price for getting the country through a difficult recession, suffering from the worst parliamentary crisis since Lloyd George and still had a program to offer. He also make the point that when the party had split int he past it was over ideology or policy and there were no stated differences presented by the opposition. So for now, Gordon has won.

C05771229	PIR <preines Thursday, September 2, 2010 6:33 PM H CDM; Huma Abedin; Lona Valmoro; Jake Sullivan Joint Interview MS — Jake just relayed yoLir desire to cancel tomorrows interview. But I want to make sure you are aware of a few things that he was not in a position to share: 1) The Israeli & Palestinian interviewers and their teams skipped returning home today with their principals at great cost and energy in order to stay the extra day to you. One skipped traveling onward with Abbas. 2) Both the Israeli & Palestinian media outlets involved immediately announced their joint interview and are hyping its unprecedented nature 3) Because of #2, U.S. media is fully aware that this interview is scheduled for tomorrow morning. So three points: 1) There is an incredibly high expectation for this interview occurring and canceling, no matter the reason cited, will be taken to mean something negative2) The point of this interview was to shape the narrative coming out of today, and canceling will only contribute to a negative narrative in that we will be canceling on the most important figure in Israeli media, and I do not see Channel 2 taking that well3) As positive as the symbolism of this interview was meant to be, we run the risk of the negative symbolism by canceling. Typically when you want to cancel something I roll with it. But I want to strenuously object to doing so in this case. I understand you told the participants they should refrain from public comment, but first, that doesnt mean you have to and second, you know they wont really refrain. And I am certain they will appreciate the effusive things you have to say about them during this interview. Not to mention that the reason for canceling is something we ourselves could have foreseen before going so far down the road, and should have - which I dont think is fair or reflects well on you. Lastly, on a much more practical note: to get you out of this I am going to have to bribe Channel 2 with a significant and exclusive interview when we are in Jerusalem in two weeks, and I guarantee you that will be far more painful than tomorrows relative short and peaceful format. If youd like to discuss Im at my desk and available or can call you through Ops.
C05764183	.... for terrific talk and discussion. Your robust statement on missile defense was the best so far. As for your robust push-back on the premise of my healthcare question, I didnt mean to imply that the Clinton administrations foreign policy agenda suffered back then—rather, that theres jeopardy to the Obama administrations foreign policy if the current debate/fight turns out badly.

C05771145	sbwhoeop Wednesday, August 25, 2010 10:52 AM worth reading, even if you know the Intel B6 H: Im sure you know the facts in this well-informed piece, how Mullah Omar was saved by ISI, for example, but the idea of Afghanistan as an aspect of lndo-Pak war is the best and overarching strategic concept. Sid http://www.newstatesman.com/asia/2010/08/india-pakistan-afghanistan iNT aLOSE The military and the mullahs William Dalrymple Published 23 August 2010 The Pakistani state has a long history of nurturing jihadis as a means of dominating Afghanistan and undermining India. It is proving a fatal alliance. It May have been a nightmarish year for Pakistan but it has been a pretty good one for the countrys inscrutable chief of army staff, the most powerful man in the Land of the Pure, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. For a start, the armys response to the floods has compared well to the usual corrupt incompetence of Pakistans civilian politicians, guided by their chateau-hopping president, Asif Ali Zardari (while minister for investment, he was nicknamed \Mr 10 Per Cent\; he has now been upgraded to \Mr 110 Per Cent\). This has led to discussion in army circles about whether it is time to drop the civilian fig leaf and return the country to the loving embrace of its military. So serious is this threat, that one of the countrys most senior and well-connected journalists. Najam Sethi, editor-in-chief of the Friday Times, went on the record this month to warn that elements in the army were plotting yet another coup.\( know this is definitely being discussed,\ he said. Then there was the news that Kayani was going to be allowed to keep his job for a second term: \an extraordinary situation requires an extraordinary decision to overcome it\, explained a brigadier, writing in the Nation newspaper. Kayani, a former head of Pakistans notorious intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISO, can now continue to run the army, and by default Pakistans foreign policy, until November 2013. But Kayanis biggest triumph this year, arguably the greatest of his career, was his visit to Kabul in July as the honoured guest of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. The visit marked an important thawing in Pak-Afghan relations, which have been glacial ever since Karzai came to power in 2001. It also coincided with the sacking of Amrullah Saleh, Karzais pro-Indian and rabidly anti-ISI former security chief. Saleh is a tough Tajik who rose to prominence as a mujahedin protege of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Indian-backed \Lion of Panjshir\. The Taliban, and their sponsors in the ISI, had regarded Saleh as their fiercest opponent, something Saleh was enormously proud of. When I had dinner with him in Kabul in May, he spoke at length of his frustration with the ineffectiveness of Karzais government in taking the fight to the Taliban, and the extent to which the ISI was managing to aid, arm and train its puppet insurgents in North Waziristan and Balochistan. Salehs sacking gave notice of an important change of direction by Karzai. As Bruce Riedel, Barack Obamas Af-Pak adviser, said when the news broke, \it means that Karzai is already planning for a post-American Afghanistan\. • It seems that Kayani and Karzai are discussing some sort of accommodation between the Afghan government and ISI- sponsored elements in the Taliban, maybe those of Sirajuddin Haqqani, which could give over much of the Pashtun south to pro-Pakistan Taliban, but preserve Karzai in power in Kabul after the US withdrawal. The expulsion of India, Pakistans great regional rival, from Afghanistan, or at least the closing of its four regional consulates, would be a top priority for the ISI in return for any deal that kept Karzai in power. With the US toppling of the Taliban after the 11 September 2001 attacks, Pakistans influence disappeared abruptly from Afghanistan and India quickly filled the vacuum. To the ISIs horror, in the early years of this decade, India provided reconstruction assistance and training worth roughly £835m in total. It also built roads, sanitation projects, the new Afghan parliament and free medical facilities across the country. It even offered to help train the Afghan army. Nato refused. As General Stanley McChrystal put it in a report last year, \while Indian activities largely benefit the Afghan people, increasing Indian influence in Afghanistan is likely to exacerbate regional tensions and encourage Pakistani countermeasures\. McChrystal was right. The Pakistanis have always been paranoid about the small Indian presence in Afghanistan. \We have strong evidence [that India is] using Afghanistan against Pakistans interests to destabilise Pakistan,\ a foreign ministry spokesman claimed in March. Pakistan's military establishment, terrified of the economic superpower emerging to the south, believes it would be suicide to accept an Indian presence in what it regards as its Afghan backyard - a potential point of retreat for the army in the event of an Indian invasion, something Pakistani analysts refer to as vital \strategic depth\. According to Indian diplomatic sources, there are still fewer than 3,600 Indians in Afghanistan; there are only ten Indian diplomatic officers, as opposed to nearly 150 in the UK embassy. Yet the horror of being encircled has led the ISI to risk Pakistan's relationship with its main strategic ally, the US, in order to keep the Taliban in play and its leadership under ISI patronage in Quetta - a policy Kayani developed while head of the IS!. Karzai's new deal with the Pakistanis, and his clear intention to try to reach some accommodation with their proxies among the Taliban, therefore represents a major strategic victory for Kayani and Pakistan's military, as well as a grave diplomatic defeat for India. Pakistan's support for the Taliban today is only the most recent chapter of an old story of complicity between jihadi movements and the Pakistani state. Since the days of the anti-Soviet mujahedin, Pakistan's army saw violent Islamic groups as an ingenious and cost-effective means of both dominating Afghanistan (which they finally achieved with the retreat of the Soviets in 1987) and bogging down the Hindu-dominated Indian army in Kashmir (which they managed with great effect from 1990 onwards). The former ISI director and Dick Dastardly lookalike Hamid Gul, who was largely responsible for developing the strategy, once said to me: \If the jihadis go out and contain India, tying down one rnillion men of their army on their own soil, for a legitimate cause, why should we not support them?\ Next to Gul in his Islamabad living room lay a piece of the Berlin Wall presented to him by the city's people for \delivering the first blow\ to the Soviet empire through his use of jihadis in the 1980s. The WikiLeaks documents suggest he is still busy liaising with jihadis in his \retirement\. The Pakistani military top brass were long convinced that they could control the militants they have nurtured. In a taped conversation between President Pervez Musharraf and Muhammad Aziz Khan, his chief of general staff, that India released in 1999, Aziz said the army had the jihadis by their \tooti\ (balls). Yet the Islamists have increasingly followed their own agendas, sending suicide bombers out against not just Pakistan's religious minorities and political leaders, but even the IS! headquarters. Nonetheless, many in the army still believe the jihadis are a more practical defence against Indian hegemony than nuclear weapons. For them, supporting Islamist groups is not an ideological or religious whim, so much as a practical and patriotic imperative - a vital survival strategy for a Pakistani state. The army and ISI continued this duplicitous and risky policy after 11 September 2001 despite Musharrafs public promises to the contrary. The speed with which the US lost interest in Afghanistan after its invasion and embarked on plans to invade Iraq convinced the Pakistani army that the Washington had no long-term commitment to Karzai's regime. This led to the generals keeping the Taliban in reserve, to be used to reinstal a pro-Pakistani regime in Kabul once the American gaze had turned elsewhere. So it was that the .ISI gave refuge to the leadership of the Taliban after it fled from Afghanistan in 2001. Mullah Mohammed Omar was kept in an IS! safehouse in Quetta; his militia was lodged in the sprawling suburb of Pashtunabad. There, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar presided over the Taliban military committee and war chest. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of Hizb-e-lslami, was lured back from exile in Iran and allowed to operate freely outside Peshawar, while Jalaluddin Haqqani, one of the most violent Taliban commanders, was given sanctuary in North Waziristan. Other groups were despatched to safehouses in Balochistan. By 2004, the US had filmed Pakistani army trucks delivering Taliban fighters at the Afghan border and recovering them a few days later; wireless monitoring at the US base at Bagram picked up Taliban commanders arranging with Pakistani army officers at the border for safe passage as they came in and out of Afghanistan. Western intelligence agencies concluded that the ISI was running a full training programme for the Afghan Taliban, turning a blind eye as they raised funds in the Gulf and allowing them to import materiel, mainly via Dubai. By 2005 the Taliban, with covert Pakistani support, were launching a full-scale assault on Nato troops in Afghanistan and being given covering fire as they returned to their bases in Pakistan. At the same time, Taliban attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan intensified, beginning the process of turning the Afghan conflict, like that in Kashmir, into what it is today: an lndo-Pak proxy war. The Indian embassy in Kabul was twice bombed - in July 2008 and October 2009 - as were two city-centre hotels thought to have been used by the Research and Analysis Wing (Raw), the Indian intelligence agency. Seven Indian civilians and two Indian military officers died in the blasts. The degree to which the ISI has been controlling the Afghan Taliban has only just become clear, and not just in the documents published by WikiLeaks. A report by Matt Waldman of the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard, based on interviews with ten former senior Taliban commanders, closely documents how the IS! \orchestrates, sustains and strongly influences\ the Taliban and shows how the !SI is even represented on the Taliban's supreme leadership council, the Quetta Shura. Meanwhile, in the Punjab, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the man believed to have been behind the 2008 Bombay attacks, has been allowed to continue operating from Muridke, near Lahore. \The powerful western world is terrorising Muslims,\ he told a conference in Islamabad this year. \We are being invaded, manipulated and looted. We must fight the evil trio of America, Israel and India. Suicide missions are in accordance with Islam. In fact, a suicide attack is the best form of jihad.\ At the same time as Pursuing its policy of selectively using jihadis, Pakistan has appeased the US by giving generous assistance to the CIA in arresting foreign Arab al-Qaeda personnel. A major assault was also launched against both the militants who took over the Lal Masjid and the ultra-radical Pakistan Taliban who took over the Swat Valley and announced their intention of turning the country into an Islamic Emirate. In the course of these operations and others in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, more than 1,500 Pakistani soldiers and policemen were killed; another 250,000 people were made homeless in the Pak army assault on Bajaur. The IS1 has even been prepared to arrest any members of the Afghan Taliban who didn't follow orders. Hence the seizure in Karachi, in February, of the Taliban second-in- command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, along with aboutia dozen other senior Taliban whom the ISI regarded as infringing on their hospitality by opening talks with the Karzai administration via the Saudis, without ISI clearance. Yet, even though the Pakistani army has conducted major offensives in six of the tribal areas, the seventh, North Waziristan, has been left alone, as it is home to the ISI's favourite proxies: Haqqani and Hekmatyar. Similarly, Pakistan's foot-dragging response to the 2008 attacks on Bombay, and the lack of response to the attacks on minority faith groups in Pakistan over the past few months, show that the Janus-faced policy remains in place. This summer, the chief minister of the Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, was quoted heatedly denying that there were any militant groups working in the Pakistani Punjab, or that the Punjabi Taliban even existed. There are still, in the eyes of many in the Pakistani establishment, good Taliban and bad Taliban, useful militants and expendable ones. In their eyes, the ongoing defeat of Nato in Afghanistan, with US and British troops suffering record casualties last month, is a vindication of its long-term strategy. Islamabad has succeeded in regaining influence in Afghanistan and Delhi has been checked. But India will not take this lying down. Already the Indian press has reported attempts to - resuscitate the Northern Alliance as a contingency against the Taliban's takeover of the south, and here India is working in conjuction with Russia, Iran and the central Asian \stans\. The Indian national security adviser, Shivshankar Menon, was despatched to Afghanistan in March, and the foreign minister, S M Krishna, has visited Tehran. Post-American Afghanistan is looking increasingly likely to be divided between the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara north and the Pashtun south, either formally, with a partition, or more likely, to slip into inter-ethnic civil war, with India supporting and arming the north and Pakistan the south. As diplomacy gathers pace, the Afghan Taliban, who already control over 70 per cent of the country. continue to increase their power. The most worrying development has been the spread of Taliban units to the previously peaceful north, where they have taken over pockets of Pathan settlement around Kunduz and Badakhshan. The death of the British aid worker Karen Woo on 5 August was a direct result. In Pakistan. too, jihadi activity is growing. Last year there were 87 suicide attacks across the country, killing roughly 3,000 people and the ISI this week stated that, for the first time in the nation's history, it regarded home-grown Islamic militants to be a bigger threat to the integrity of the nation than India. Yet the army continues to obsess about India. In a recent speech, Kayani emphasised that although the army knows the dangers of militancy, it was against Indian attacks that he was principally focused. At a time when Pakistan's economy is in crisis, electricity supply increasingly erratic and the educational system in complete breakdown, Kayani has secured a huge increase in the country's defence budget. It is not a pretty picture: growing violence everywhere, increasing Indo-Pak tensions and a defeat for western interests in the region. Worst of all, because the Pakistani army regards this as a major triumph, it is unlikely to change its policy any time soon.

C05768619	FYI Kristof's OpEd From Today's NY Times. April 22, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Obama Backs Down on Sudan By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF JUBA, Sudan Until he reached the White House, Barack Obama repeatedly insisted that the United States apply more pressure on Sudan so as to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur and elsewhere. Yet, as president, Mr. Obama and his aides have caved, leaving Sudan gloating at American weakness. Western monitors, Sudanese journalists and local civil society groups have all found this month's Sudanese elections to be deeply flawed - yet Mr. Obama's special envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, pre-emptively defended the elections, saying they would be \as free and as fair as possible.\ The White House showed only a hint more backbone with a hurried reference this week to \an essential step\ with \serious irregularities.\ President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan - the man wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in Darfur - has been celebrating. His regime calls itself the National Congress Party, or N.C.P., and he was quoted in Sudan as telling a rally in the Blue Nile region: \Even America is becoming an N.C.P. member. No one is against our will.\ Memo to Mr. Obama: When a man who has been charged with crimes against humanity tells the world that America is in his pocket, it's time to review your policy. Perhaps the Obama administration caved because it considers a flawed election better than no election. That's a reasonable view, one I share. It's conceivable that Mr. Bashir could have won a quasi-fair election - oil revenues have manifestly raised the standard of living in parts of Sudan - and the campaigning did create space for sharp criticism of the government. It's also true that Sudan has been behaving better in some respects. The death toll in Darfur is hugely reduced, and the government is negotiating with rebel groups there. The Sudanese government gave me a visa and travel permits to Darfur, allowing me to travel legally and freely. The real game isn't, in fact, Darfur or the elections but the maneuvering for a possible new civil war. The last north-south civil war in Sudan ended with a fragile peace in 2005, after some two million deaths. The peace agreement provided for a referendum, scheduled to take place in January, in which southern Sudanese will decide whether to secede. They are expected to vote overwhelmingly to form a separate country. Then the question becomes: will the north allow South Sudan to separate? The south holds the great majority of the country's oil, and it's difficult to see President Bashir allowing oil fields to walk away. \If the result of the referendum is independence, there is going to be war - complete war,\ predicts Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, one of Sudan's most outspoken human rights advocates. He cautions that America's willingness to turn a blind eye to election-rigging here increases the risk that Mr. Bashir will feel that he can get away with war. \Theyre very naïve in Washington,\ Mr. Mudawi said. \They dont understand what is going on.\ On the other hand, a senior Sudanese government official, Ghazi Salahuddin, told me unequivocally in Khartoum, the nation's capital, that Sudan will honor the referendum results. And it's certainly plausible that north and south will muddle through and avoid war, for both sides are exhausted by years of fighting. Here in Juba, the South Sudan capital, I met Winnie Wol, 26, who fled the civil war in 1994 after a militia from the north attacked her village to kill, loot, rape and burn. Her father and many relatives were killed, but she escaped and made her way to Kenya - and eventually resettled as a refugee in California. She now lives in Olathe, Kan., and she had returned for the first time to Sudan to visit a mother and sisters she had last seen when she was a little girl. Ms. Wol, every bit the well-dressed American, let me tag along for her journey back to her village of Nyamlell, 400 miles northwest of Juba. The trip ended by a thatch-roof hut that belonged to her mother, who didn't know she was coming - so no one was home. Ms. Wol was crushed. Then there was a scream and a woman came running. It was Ms. Wol's mother, somehow recognizing her, and they flew into each other's arms. To me, it felt like a peace dividend. Yet that peace is fragile, and Ms. Wol knows that the northern forces may come back to pillage again. \I dont want war,\ she said, \but I dont think they will allow us to separate.\ My own hunch is that the north hasn't entirely decided what to do, and that strong international pressure can reduce the risk of another savage war. If President Obama is ever going to find his voice on Sudan, it had better be soon.

Statement by the Secretary The Death of Polish President Kaczynski and His Delegation I join President Obama in offering my deepest condolences to the people of Poland, to the Kaczynski family, and to the families of all those killed in this tragedy. Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from across the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Polands post-1989 democratic transformation and were leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world, but their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland. The United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was one of Americas most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy against an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdatisk Shipyards to the presidency of a free people. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around the world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed. The Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in the face of adversity -- and I know they will pull- together in solidarity to grieve this loss. My thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.

C05767657	Editorial: Mrs. Clinton in Pakistan NEW YORK TIMES October 30, 2009 Hillary Rodham Clintons first trip to Pakistan as secretary of state was never going to be easy. The day she arrived, extremists detonated a car bomb at a crowded market in Peshawar that killed at least 100 people. The Nation newspaper dismissed the visit as a mere \PR exercise, but who will buy what the US is selling is difficult to imagine, beyond the already compliant government.\ Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis dislike and mistrust the United States. They blame Washington for using and then abandoning them after the Soviets were driven from Afghanistan. And they resent Washington for pressing their government now to fight against extremists — and suspect that they will be abandoned again. The fact that many of the extremists are on Pakistans territory and threatening Pakistans government has not shifted that thinking or mitigated that resentment. A good part of this, of course, is the failure of Pakistans government, which has still not adequately explained that this is not just Americas fight. But the United States is also to blame. For eight years the Bush administration coddled the Pakistani Army at the expense of the rest of society. Mrs. Clinton challenged Pakistans government to do more to shut down Al Qaeda, but she was, rightly, determined to use this visit to also broaden the relationship. Instead of just courting President Asif All Zardari and the army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Mrs. Clinton also held talks with the top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif; parried questions from an audience of deeply suspicious college students; met with civil society leaders, including women and Pashtun elders; gave interviews to Pakistani journalists; and visited religious and cultural sights. She promised to refocus American aid on the \needs of the people\ and announced targeted commitments, including $85 million for microloans for poor women to start businesses and $125 million for the first phase of an electricity project aimed at reducing blackouts and improving energy conservation. Those grants are welcome but still small change when compared with a five-year, $7.5 billion — nonmilitary — aid package approved by Congress and signed into law this year. That package was supposed to demonstrate to Pakistanis that, this time, the United States is in it for the long haul. Instead, it has become another focus of popular resentment. The Army and some Pakistani news media whipped that up with disingenuous complaints that the legislation (Islamabad was consulted beforehand) compromised Pakistans sovereignty by conditioning disbursement on adequate civilian control of the military. If Washington is ever to enlist Pakistan as a reliable ally, it is going to have to do a much better job of explaining itself. And it is going to have to insist that Pakistans leaders start explaining the real stakes to their citizens and the real benefits of an alliance with the United States. Mrs. Clintons trip was an important start — but only a start.

Inc, About Us I Contact I Terms of Service I RSS A New Read on Jewish Life Fibi Netanyahu In 20015 PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords By I Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM Netanyahu in 2001. CREDIT: ::nl 1 Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. \I believe Prime Minister Netanyahu wants peace,\ Obama :3411 ill. \I believe he is ready to take risks for peace.\ A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a radically different light. in it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to \beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until its unbearable\ (all translations are mine). PI to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be \Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.\ Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States would let such an attack come to fruition. \I know what America is,\ Netanyahu replied. \America isa thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction. They wont get in their way.\ He then called former president Bill Clinton \radically pro-Palestinian,\ and went on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that. \They asked me before the election if rd honor [the Oslo accords],\ Netanyahu said. \I said I would, but ... Im going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this gallOping forward to the 67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones aresecurity zones; as far as Im concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\ Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israel alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \They didnt want to give me that letter,\ Netanyahu said, \so I didnt give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, Im not signing. Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords.\ President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape online here PI.

C05768055	See the piece below on defamation of religion. Not bad. http: I /www.economist.com/world/international/displavstorv.cfm?story id=15833005 Religion and human rights The limits of freedom and faith Mar 31st 2010 From The Economist print edition Opponents of a bid by Muslim states to \protect religion\ claim a small success How dare you call us blasphemers? IT DOES not happen often: Christian lobbyists, the sort who favour prayer in American classrooms and crucifixes in Italian ones, lining up on the same side as secularists who battle to curb religion's role in the public square. But in both those camps there has been some quiet satisfaction after a recent vote at the United Nations. Not over the outcome, but over the slim margin of defeat. On March 25th the Human Rights Council (HRC), a Geneva-based UN agency which often exasperates its Western members, voted by 20 votes to 17, with eight abstentions, for a text that lists the \defamation of religion\ as an infringement of liberty. Nothing amazing there: the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which groups 56 mainly Muslim states (plus Palestine), has been working to push resolutions of that kind through the General Assembly and other UN bodies since 2005. But the margin was the smallest ever, and opponents think there could be a good chance of defeating a \defamation\ motion next time one comes around. The OIC's idea is to establish the principle that faiths need protection, just as individuals do. It denies any sinister intention (see article). And to some ears, the OIC's effort sounds like harmless UN-speak, but nothing more. (The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a congressionally mandated body, has noted a logical flaw: defamation means harming the reputation of a living person or entity: that implies that one can't defame an idea or a religious founder who is no longer, at least physically, alive on earth.) But critics of the OIC campaign, who include atheists, Christians and indeed some Muslims, say the \defamation\ idea is worse than hot air: far from protecting human rights, it emboldens countries that use blasphemy laws to criminalise dissent. What encourages these critics is that more countries seem to be coming around to their view. Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, Zambia and South Korea voted against the latest resolution. Brazil criticised the text but abstained. Deeper still inside the UN's bureaucracy, another battle over religion rages—and the stakes could be even higher. An \ad hoc committee\ is mulling ways to amend or extend the UN convention on racial discrimination. Certain states want language that would fuse the categories of race and faith; some want a new convention, or a protocol to the existing one. For secularists (in the broad sense of people, including believers, who oppose the idea of faith having privileged access to power), all this is alarming. Non-binding resolutions against defamation are bad enough; a UN treaty on race-plus-religion would have legal force, at least for its signatories, and give heart to theocrats. At the HRC's latest discussion of this effort in March, the Algerian who oversees the project was keen to plough ahead. But countries like Switzerland, Japan, Mexico, Argentina and France retorted that it would be better to enforce the existing UN norms than dream up new ones. Efforts to widen the racism accord will resume, with a new chairman, late this year—but critics are relieved to have stalled it. Still, would-be theocrats may now focus harder on adding to the racism charter, because they face a real risk of being defeated over defamation, in the view of Roy Brown, Geneva spokesman for the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Meanwhile a Christian-inspired NGO, the European Centre for Law and Justice, has been denouncing the abuse of blasphemy laws in many OIC member states. How fair is their point? It is an easy case to make, for example, over Pakistan. Some 41 complaints of blasphemy were registered by police in Pakistan last year, says that country's independent Human Rights Commission. In theory, blasphemy is punishable by death—a penalty that has been handed down but never carried out. Worst-hit by the law are minorities like Christians and Ahmadis, a group whose claim to be Muslim is rejected by the Pakistani state. Although abuse of the law is less rife now than in the 1980s, when an Islamist general tightened up the rules, the law is still invoked in disputes (over property, say) that have nothing to do with faith. \The most vulnerable people, that is religious minorities, continue to be charged with blasphemy,\ said Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, a campaign group. \But are people convicted? No. Rarely. It is used as an instrument of political and social coercion.\ When convictions occur, they lead to long jail terms; and pre-trial detention can last for years. Pakistan's parliament is revising the constitution but it has left intact the religious bits, despite a vow by the ruling party to review the blasphemy laws. (Indonesia too has stepped back from a move to liberalise its blasphemy regime.) On Pakistani streets, the law has dire effects. In January 2009, in a village in Punjab province, five Ahmadis, a labourer and four children, were charged with blasphemy. They had supposedly written \Prophet Muhammad\ on the wall of a mosque toilet. The children were behind bars for nearly six months till the charge was quashed. And last September a young Pakistani Christian was accused of throwing part of the Koran down a drain. It seems that his real crime, however, was affection for a Muslim woman. A mob torched a church, and many Christians had to flee. He was taken to jail, where he died a few days later. His family alleged torture; the authorities claimed suicide. There was mayhem at the funeral and the country's Christians (see picture) were appalled. In some places, it is not the \defamation\ of faith that threatens rights but measures that supposedly defend it.

C05774218	Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didn't see - would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally, it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization, management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we) could do to drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true. Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful. Thanks, Chelsea Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of importance. Bolded what I think most important.: - Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic in their thinking at best and arrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN - UNDP I think - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to \demand their political rights\ - when they're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....) In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves, in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/ INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a women's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2 women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100 tshirts -though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important than the first two `asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability from their partners. The settlements' governing bodies - as they shared with me - are beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement residents themselves The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while rebuilding over next -5 years) The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water supplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam, IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for -40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for -45k today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work; settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night while most sit in darkness) This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects on the Haitian government, including that it has now visibly distanced itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was \such a waste of time\ and he said that is representative of the government's current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings were \more efficient.\ This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very few actor(s) reliably show up Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA; no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au Prince UN 'bases' - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP, for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the \UN\ / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other central locations There is NO accountability in the UN system or international humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the 40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning - important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean latrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it appeared - on rubble cleaning. Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4 settlements for at least the next month. The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for next week. In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are covered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti. (Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian doctors I met said, \We must be so poor we cant tell them [UN and INGOs] what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.\). There is also great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community- that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect. On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Churchs efforts is notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present. Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this is familiar.): The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground, otherwise it could be \empowered\ to do this but it ostensibly already is. However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g., latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross- cutting (e.g., pay for work) There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines, tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing, maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport. A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us, particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)? On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent wages until a market could develop The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the settlements at the minimum Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince. For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to locals) laying effectively fallow - and I dont think anyone expects an outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have now offered to rebuild Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers, etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term that should accommodate a local dimension Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for non-earthquake related cases. Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what the transfer plan is Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively- experienced chaos on Sunday Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent - but still unclear what the action plan is Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure its the best plan, but it is a plan and we should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just cant process right now FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it: o Near term/ for the next year ■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only); ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the youngest children. ■ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime ministers lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close to one another ■ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least 2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation, school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older children/young adults who may be too old for initial school plan; how to best support / help create where needed settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis, who is in the settlements ■ Over next 6-12 months: • Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families to return to and subsequently encourage them to do so; government estimates this will be —30% of all homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no evidence base) • Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre- existing villages around Port Au Prince where feasible to enable the government to move people out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move 400-1000 families to each of these as needed o Longer-term: ■ Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people would move back or what the governments post-rebuild vision looks like ■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed before the earthquake ■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the \plan\ Context I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Pauls formal meetings in Port Au Prince with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving voice to the voiceless, i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit, including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH, Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors, nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers (from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID, as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers, head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.

C05739590	http://religion.b1ogs.cnn.com/20 1 2/09/13/my-take-a-deadlv-link-between-islamic-and-anti-islam c-extremists/ Editors Note: Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of \The American Bible: How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation,\ is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor. By Stephen Prothero, Special to CNN What should we make of the attacks on the U.S. consulates in Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens? It depends on who you mean by \we.\ From the perspective of those who stormed the embassies, taking down the American flag in Egypt and replacing it with a black flag reading, \There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,\ theirs was an act of justice on behalf of the One True Faith. The Americans had it coming, according to this view, because Americans are on the wrong side in the clash of civilizations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim world. And the creation of an anti-Islamic video (ironically entitled \Innocence of Muslims\) by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst (or excuse) for the protests. Why Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed Most Americans operate by a different \we.\ From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly attack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech. Libyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, \I condemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free people everywhere.\ \Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,\ Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. \The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\ In a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as\This Is Water,\ novelist David Foster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the \natural, basic self-centeredness\ that puts \me\ at the center of the world. This unconscious \default setting\ fosters the sort of \blind certainty\ that manifests as arrogant atheism and fundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that \default setting\ — to begin to see things from the perspectives of others.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Wallace focused in his speech on the individual \I.\ But his critique can be applied as well to another \default setting\ (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of Give:5 According to those who stormed the embassies, \Innocence of Muslims\ was not made by an individual (whoever the shadowy \Sam Bacile\ may — or may not — be). It was made by anAmerican. Moreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual Americans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the protests turned deadly, condemning \the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\ CNNs Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories Meanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \Innocence of Muslims\ are imprisoned in some groupthink of their own, which gathers all the worlds Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire. Their film doesnt just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as dupes. Unfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting. When questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself as \Sam Bacile\ reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \Islam is a cancer.\ You dont need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled, and you dont need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running. I am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and religion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than offending them with an ignorant movie. Nonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as \blind certainty.\ Our world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and Hindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians. Neither is it divided into secularists and people of faith — the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion. The real \red line\ in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent days, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of innocents in Libya and Egypt. Both groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of \blind certainty,\ unacquainted with both the complexity and contradictions of life on Earth and the \cloud of unknowing\ that hovers over every major religion. The great religious thinkers in Judaism, Christianity and Islam always knew enough to know that they did not know everything. They knew the difference between the eternal decrees of the God of Abraham and the all-too-flawed thoughts of ordinary people. They knew, in short, that they are not God, who alone is charged with creating and destroying the world and discriminating along the way between the real and the illusory. The killers in Libya have forgotten that. So have the not-so-innocent producers and distributors of Innocence of Islam.\ The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Prothero.

By Sarah Chayes November 15, 2012 The scandal enveloping members of Americas adulated top brass is the deepest crisis to hit the military in decades. It is a crisis President Obama did not need — shaming the country and increasing his burden during a major transition on his national security team. And yet, crisis can be a great corrective. Obama should use this one to reverse one of the most dysfunctional elements of U.S. foreign policy over the last decade: an infatuation with military solutions to problems that are fundamentally political. The resignation of former Central Intelligence Agency Director David H. Petraeus after an extramarital affair came to light, together with expected high-level personnel changes at the State Department and other agencies, creates a singular opportunity to embark on the complex process of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy in favor of non-military approaches. When he first came to office, Obama seemed suspicious of Petraeus, who made his reputation under President George W. Bush as the general who transformed the militarys approach to the Iraq war. The suspicion was reflected in the fraught National Security Council debate over Afghanistan strategy in 2009. Yet since then, Obama, like so many others, seems to have been seduced by Petraeus. Not by the man but by what the man could offer him. Petraeuss unique political genius over the last decade has been to provide each of two contrasting presidents a military solution to his key national security problems that was tailored to his character. For Bush, obsessed with Iraq and with leaving a mark on the Middle East, Petraeus helped design a grandiose, troop-heavy approach. With the change of administrations, Petraeus soon saw that Obama and his team were different — concerned about the costs of the inherited wars and about the risks of a runaway military. So while Petraeus continued to pay lip-service to counterinsurgency doctrine, he veered away from it in practice.

NO FOIA WAIVER. the troops in Afghanistan — and even more so at the CIA — was on a type of warfare better suited to this president: targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing over which the president could exert control. But such an approach, though cheaper in resources and American lives, is still flawed. It is still a military answer to problems that are deeply political in nature and rooted in a complex mix of history, regional and cultural particularism, and the effects of a protracted abuse of power by elites. By shifting to drones and special ops as the instruments of choice to combat militant extremism, the U.S. government remains consumed by the same old questions: How many men and women in uniform, equipped with what kind of hardware, need to employ which tactics to defeat the enemy? What atrophied during the years that two U.S. administrations dwelt obsessively on these questions were all the other tools of U.S. foreign policy, including information-gathering and analysis, diplomacy and economic and legal leverage. Perhaps the gravest consequence has been the knowledge deficit. Both wars were hampered by a devastating lack of situational understanding. In Afghanistan, where I lived and worked for more than eight years, I was stunned by how long it took U.S. officials to realize that tribes were key to Afghan social structure. U.S. officials resisted meeting with ordinary Afghans, dealing instead with members of a self-serving and unpopular government. So, for more than a decade, the U.S. government was operating almost blind. The first way Obama can constructively harness Petraeus downfall is to reorient the CIA toward its core function: intelligence-gathering. Of late, a body-count culture has prevailed at the CIA, exemplified by the secretive drone campaign. If 60 intelligence professionals are assigned to planning and monitoring each drone in the air, as has been reported, thats 60 who are not on the ground in country, interacting with locals, gaining an intuitive feel for the dynamics. Obama should resist the temptation to put another target-focused operator at the helm of the CIA. Another main civilian component of U.S. power is its diplomacy. Obama should also use this moment of transition to think through what kind of State Department he really needs. The instruments of U.S. foreign policy are multiple, varied and subtle in their application. To avail itself of them, the government needs smart, adaptable, dynamic risk-takers, who think strategically and operate with autonomy. Such people must be attracted to government service and provided responsibilities commensurate with their talents. But the other national security topic of the moment threatens to push Obama in the wrong direction. The death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, has been politicized in deeply counterproductive ways. Members of Congress should bear that in mind as they continue examining the details of the attack. Stevens was exactly the type of diplomat the U.S. government needs: someone with long experience in the region to which he was posted, an ambassador who engaged with people, gained insight into the environment and helped influence it. That kind of diplomacy is essential, but it carries risks. If it becomes politically untenable in Washington for an ambassador to die in the line of duty, then talented diplomats will be hobbled. And faced with a choked career path, the best will look elsewhere for rewarding work. Obama should appoint a secretary of State determined to counteract the tendency to retrench. Perhaps the most important foreign policy challenge Obama faces in his second term is how to expand, restructure and reinforce the range of civilian instruments of U.S. power. That is a generational task, but one the current crisis has provided an unparalleled opportunity to tackle.

C05768015	PIR <preines( Wednesday, March 17, 2010 12:59 AM Huma Abedin Steinberg Project: First (Baby) Step http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/when-a-schedule-is-more-than-a-schedule/37587/ When A Schedule Is More Than A Schedule By Marc Am binder The Atlantic.com Mar 16 2010, 9:45 PM ET Close observers of the State Department noticed something different this afternoon: on the daily schedule distributed by the department includes, for the first time, information on Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinbergs appointments. Until recently, the daily release included Secretary of State Hillary Clintons schedule only. No longer. \Steinberg will meet Wednesday with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.\ The inclusion of Steinberg suggests that the department is aware that it needs to do a better job of integrating Steinbergs portfolio into its general communications strategy and show how the leadership of the department acts in concert. \Jim has always been an integral part of the Secretarys team, but we havent always shown how crucial he is to States mission,\ said Philippe Reines, Clinton's communications consiglieri. \This is a one simple way to fix that.\ The Beltway rumor mill often includes gossip that Steinberg isn't happy, or that he's not seen as an integral part of President Obama's foreign policy team, or that his efforts aren't appreciated. Reines, who rarely speaks on the record, responded to a question about whether Steinberg is indeed unhappy in this way: \Im not a shrink, and I have to confess that we dont sit around in a circle often enough exploring our feelings. But what is crystal clear to everyone is that Jim is smart, dedicated, and valued.\ Steinberg has a been a principal adviser on issues ranging from Iran -- he is the administration's team lead, cybersecurity and China (he's been tasked with pressuring China into accepting tougher sanctions on Iran), but his work often goes unnoticed. On Friday, he is said to have given a tongue-lashing to the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren, about that country's actions during a visit by Vice President Biden. When President Obama selected Gen. Jim Jones as National Security Adviser, he asked Clinton to make Steinberg her deputy -- and she did. Since day one, prognosticators have been predicting friction between Steinberg and Clinton, although none has publicly surfaced.

OLUMNISTS JVlartin Wolf Obama was too cautious in fearful times By Martin Wolf Published: Au• ust 31 2010 22:48 j Last updated: August 31 2010 22:48 Suppose that the US presidential election of 1932 had, in fact, taken place in 1930, at an early stage in the Great Depression. Suppose, too, that Franklin Delano Roosevelt had won then, though not by the landslide of 1932. How different subsequent events might have been. The president might have watched helplessly as output and employment collapsed. The decades of Democratic dominance might not have happened. On such chances the wheel of history turns. But this time was different: the crisis brought Barack Obama to power close to the beginning of the economic collapse. I (among others) then argued that policy needed to be hugely aggressive. Alas, it was not. I noted on February 4 2009, at the beginning of the new presidency: \Instead of an overwhelming fiscal stimulus, what is emerging is too small, too wasteful and too ill-focused.\ A week later, I asked: \Has Barack Obamas presidency already failed? In normal times, this would be a ludicrous question. But these are not normal times. They are times of great danger. Today, the new US administration can disown responsibility for its inheritance; tomorrow, it will own it. Today, it can offer solutions; tomorrow it will have become the problem. Today, it is in control of events; tomorrow, events will take control of it. Doing too little is now far riskier than doing too much.\ This was right. The direction of policy was not wrong: policymakers — though not all economists — had learnt a great deal from the 1930s. Sensible people knew that aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion was needed, together with reconstruction of the financial sector. But, as Larry Summers, Mr Obamas chief economic adviser, had said: \When markets overshoot, policymakers must overshoot too\. Unfortunately, the administration failed to follow his excellent advice. This has allowed opponents to claim that policy has been ineffective when it has merely been inadequate. In consequence, the administration has lost credibility with the public and the chances of a renewed fiscal expansion have disappeared. With the Federal Reserve cautious, too, the likelihood of a lengthy period of weak growth and heavy joblessness is high. So, too, are the chances of domestic and global political friction. True, the idea that the policies adopted in the last few months of the Bush administration and the first months of this one were far better than nothing is weirdly controversial in the US. A recent paper by Alan Blinder, former vice-chairman of the Fed, and Mark Zandi of Moodys argues that such critics are wrong. They use a standard macro-economic model to assess what would have happened without any intervention, without the financial interventions (including monetary policy) and without the fiscal action. They conclude that the peak to trough decline in gross domestic product would have been close to 12 per cent with no policy response, compared to an actual decline of just 4 per cent (see chart). Similarly, the unemployment rate would have peaked at 16.5 per cent, instead of the actual 10 per cent. The bigger collapse would also have meant a fiscal deficit of $2,600bn in fiscal year 2011. The outcome is also disastrous with the modest fiscal response but no financial •olic res•onse. It is a little better the other way round. The implication that the modest stimulus package of February 2009 — a mere 5.7 per cent of 2009 GDP, spread over several years — made a positive contribution is supported by the analysis of the Congressional Budget Office: it argues that in 2010, US GDP will be between 1.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent higher and the unemployment rate between 0.7 and 1.8 percentage points lower, as a result of the package. Panglossians who believe the private economy is always in equilibrium, unless governments intervene, disagree. I wish there were some way to run this experiment without hurting hundreds of millions of people. But I find the idea that allowing the collapse of much of the financial system, avoiding unconventional monetary policy and struggling to close the fiscal deficit would have been consistent with a more rapid and sustained recovery quite bizarre. A fascinating perspective does come, however, from comparisons with what happened in other advanced countries. The recession in US output (and so demand) has been relatively small, but the decline in employment has been exceptionally large, as a result of an extraordinary surge in US productivity (see charts). This contrast between what would happen to output and what would happen to employment was missed in the initial Congressional Budget Office analysis of the stimulus. Since the US was the epicentre of the financial crisis, the relatively small decline in output is remarkable. Moreover, since fiscal and monetary stimuli bear directly on demand and output, not jobs, this is a policy success. At the same time, the enthusiasm with which US managers laid off workers is also extraordinary. No doubt, some of this is due to the collapse in construction. But some of it must be due to the ease with which US companies can lay off workers and the incentives for managers to maintain profits in a downturn at the expense of jobs. Debate is emerging on how much of the surge in unemployment is structural. My answer, from European experience, is that one way to ensure it becomes structural is to let it linger. In the short run, the simplest way to prevent that from happening is to expand demand and so output. Since there is huge slack in the labour market, not the slightest threat of inflation — far more a risk of deflation — and no constraint from bond or foreign exchange markets on further monetary and fiscal stimulus, these are the policies that have to be pursued. Yet, alas, the Fed seems to have decided to fall asleep and the administration has lost the initiative. So what is going to happen? I assume that, after the midterm elections, resurgent Republicans will offer new tax cuts and ignore the fiscal deficits. They will pretend that this has nothing to do with any reviled stimulus, though it is much the same thing — increasing fiscal deficits, thereby offsetting private frugality. That would put the administration on the spot. It would have to choose between vetoing the tax cuts and accepting them, so allowing the Republicans to get the credit for their \yacht and mansion-led\ recovery. Any recovery is better than none. But it could have been much better than this. Those who were cautious when they should have been bold will pay a big price. martin.wolf@ft.com More columns at www.ft.com/martinwolf Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2010.

C05766092	Ive asked Todd to identify the specific areas where he thinks progress can be made through discussions on Thursday. At a high level, I think leaders conversations on Thursday will begin to narrow gaps on the big issues -- transparency, funding, inscribing commitments, etc -- IF (and its a big if) those gaps are narrow-able. If theyre not, then Thursday/Friday will be days of trying and failing ... but at least trying. Todds view is that there is not enough time Friday for top-level meetings to close the deal; that two days are required. You would be our head of delegation for the first, POTUS for the second.

C05772693	This is the distilled, pure and utterly conventional wisdom of much of the DC political chattering class at this moment. The first two paragraphs are the most important, completely accurate in assessment, the rest twaddle: 1:1 Monday, Oct. 11,2010 Why Obama Is Losing the Political War By Mark Halperin Barack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by mass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after Novembers elections. With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same conclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or persuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox News pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big money for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obamas troubled first year, issue by issue.) On Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data — the last major jobs figures before the midterms — Obama said, \Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time.\ But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that Obamas decisions are causing harm — that businesses are being hurt by the Administrations legislation and that economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing, immigration and spending. And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obamas capacity to turn things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him — Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.) The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman, the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a Dayton career fair says starkly, \There are no jobs.\ A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, \I've been looking for a job now for 13 months.\ Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the breadlines for the Obama years. Most of Obamas private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on. He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents havent put forth specifics of their own, nor offered genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the rights activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obamas top 10 sound bites.) But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to spur growth. Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership — or was it something about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story line). Feinting and gibing cant obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.) The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue, the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said Friday, \the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, Youre hired,\ and thats still not occurring for too many Americans. The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger. The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama Administration hasnt much to offer either, except more of the same that isnt working. • Find this article at: • http://www.time.com/time/golitics/article/0,8599,2024718,00.html Copyright © 2010 Time Inc.

C05769186	sbwhoeop Wednesday, March 31, 2010 9:06 AM H: NI fallout continues. Sid New blow for Conservative alliance with UUP as assembly member quits party Alan McFarland follows MP Lady Hermon in resigning from Ulster Unionists to sit as independent • Henry McDonaid, Ireland correspondent • gi,;ardian.co.uk, Wednesday 31 March 2010 09.48 BST The ConseNatives alliance with the Ulster Unionists has sustained a second blow in North Down after last weeks resignation of the sitting MP Lady Hermon. Assembly member and former army major Alan McFarland announced today that he was leaving the UUP in protest at its pact with the Tories. It is expected McFarland will now work for Hermans re-election as an independent against the official UUP-Tory candidate. A UUP statement said the timing of McFarlands announcement was \disappointing\. He has been a UUP member of the Stormont assembly for 12 years and was once a loyal ally of Lord Trimble, Nprthem Irelards former first minister. Trimble has been one of the driving forces behind the UUP-Conservative alliance. Last night McFarland resigned his membership of the party and said he would now sit as an independent member of the assembly. \With the recent confirmation of candidates, including the imposition of a Conservative candidate in my own North Down constituency,•it is clear that the party is determined to continue down the Conservative road,\ he said in a statement. \I do not wish to join them. I am sorry to leave a party that contains many good friends, and greatly regret that events have developed in the way they have.\ Last week Hermon, the MP for North Down, said she would run in the general election as an independent unionist. In a statement, the Ulster Unionist party thanked McFarland for his service, but said the \electoral pact has the potential to transform politics in Northern Ireland in a manner not previously witnessed\ in Ulster.
C05766808	Rajiv Shah From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Current Under Secretary Rajiv Shah Rajiv \Raj\ Shah (born March 9, 1973) is presently Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the United States Department of Agriculture. Prior to his appointment at USDA, Shah worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation including Director of Agricultural Development, Director of Financial Services, leader of the Strategic Opportunities initiative and manager of the Foundations $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing, and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this facility. Before joining the Gates Foundation, Shah was a health care policy advisor on the Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 and a member of Governor Ed Rendells (D-PA) transition committee on health. Shah earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and M.Sc. in Health Economics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan and also attended the London School of Economics. President Obama announced Shahs selection as Under Secretary of Research, Education, and Economics and Chief Scientist on April 17, 2009. Shahs nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on May 12, 2009. Early life and family Born to Indian immigrant parents who settled in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the late 60s, Raj Shah grew up in the Detroit area and attended Wylie Groves High School. He lives with his wife, Shivam, and their two young children, Sajan and Amna. He has one sister, Ami Shah, who is a medical doctor. Career Raj Shah is currently the Under Secretary of Research, Education and Economics (REE) and Chief Scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The REE mission area provides the science that federal agencies, policy makers, researchers, and others draw on to meet challenges facing Americas food and agriculture system. The four REE agencies are the Agricultural Research Service (including the National Agricultural Library), the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service. Prior to his appointment at USDA Raj worked in a range of leadership roles at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help the poorest people on earth lead healthy and productive lives. As the Director of the Agricultural Development program, Shah oversaw the foundations multi-billion dollar portfolio of grant and program-related investments to help transform rural economies throughout the developing world and help small farmers and their families overcome hunger and poverty. He led efforts to create the Alliancefor a Green Revolution in Africa, helped recruit its leadership including UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and serves on its Board of Directors. He oversaw grant portfolios in science and technology; farmer productivity; market access; and policy, statistics and advocacy; and managed a team of more than 60 professionals. He also developed innovative partnerships with private industry, the United Nations, the World Bank, and country governments around the world, where he was an active voice on issues related to food and hunger. As the Foundations first Director for the Financial Services to the Poor portfolio, Shah worked with a broad range of financial institutions and other donors to determine how Foundation resources could best amplify the fields collective impact. Previously, he led the Strategic Opportunities initiative which worked with Foundation co-chairs to identify, assess and recommend new areas of giving. This process led to the creation of the Foundations Global Development Program. Shahs early work with the Foundation focused on global health. As Deputy Director for Policy and Finance, Raj managed the Foundations $1.5 billion commitment to the Vaccine Fund — an effort referred to by Bill and Melinda Gates as their best investment. He also came up with the idea for the International Finance Facility for Immunization to transform the global system of vaccine financing and worked to secure donor commitments of more than $5 billion for this facility. The World Health Organization estimates this initiative will save more than five million childrens lives through the next decade, and a New York Times article described the effort as \a clever way to reduce the burden of costly diseases now and save money in the future.\ Shah previously worked as a health care policy advisor on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign, was an active supporter of the Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008, and served as a member of Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendells health transition committee. He also co-founded Health Systems Analytics (a health care consulting firm), served as an advisor to the City of Philadelphias Public Health Commissioner, and worked at the World Health Organization. In addition, he co-founded multiple nonprofit organizations focused on increasing the political awareness and civic engagement of minority communities, including Project Impact for South Asian Americans.

C05772115	sbwhoeop Wednesday, September 8, 2010 2:35 PM H: First review of your speech. Goad you used Acheson. Sid aarys Homerun of a Speech by Tunku Varadarajan September 8, 2010 I 12:16pm Clinton speaks at the Council on Foreign Relations September 8, 2010 in Washington, , DC. (Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered the best speech of the Obama administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on her \new American moment\—and why shes better than her boss. Behold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude—and rose petals if you have them on hand—on the firm, unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just offered it up to the world. In the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use only in the loosest sense), the speech Wednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, was the first time we have been given an unreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best speech of this administration. Whereas her president has frequently wrung his elegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that America is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday that we are all living \a new American moment—a moment when our global leadership is essential.\ There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes; there was, instead, a promise that \we will do everything we can to exercise the traditions of American leadership at home and abroad.\ What is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much, much better president than Obama. Try this for size: \The United States can, must and will lead in the new century.\ In order to do that, Clinton promised \a new global architecture,\ \built to last and withstand stress.\ And in a muscular departure from the way in which this administration—for fear of seeming Bush-like—has been shrinking from the unembarrassed propagation of American values, she uttered these plainspoken, unadorned words: \Democracy needs defending.\ X Human rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted to follow \the rules of the road\ in its aspiration to be a great power; as was Russia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar world, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves as our equals. Clinton used phrases like \American might,\ words that we are more accustomed to hearing from Republicans—words that weve come to believe that many Democrats cant bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into a vocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud. Hillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson in her reference to the need for \good, old-fashioned diplomacy,\ and there certainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech. Good, old-fashioned diplomacy, it should be noted, is in contrast to Obamas apparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit bigger, richer, and better-armed. Clintons \old-fashioned\ diplomacy is based, by contrast, on the unquestionable premise that America is the worlds leader. Not primus inter pares; just primus. In her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of \American might.\ The first, of course, is \economic power.\ But it is her hailing of the second—Americas \moral authority\—that was so invigorating. It was Acheson who said: \The most important aspect of the relationship between the president and the secretary of state is that they both understand who is president.\ What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact, plain to behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much, much better president than Obama. Tunku Varadarajan is a national affairs correspondent and writer at large for The Daily Beast.

C05768302	sbwhoeop Saturday, March 20, 2010 5:54 PM H: fyi. sid H: Uri Avnery, the Israeli analyst and activist, is privately circulating this analysis today. One consequence: Petraeus cannot run as a Republican. At least Putin didnt bring his big dogs in with him like he did with Merkel. Cheers, Sid Uri Avnery 20.3.10 The Doomsday Weapon IT IS already a commonplace to say that people who dont learn from history are condemned to repeat their mistakes. Some 1942 years ago, the Jews in the province called Palaestina launched a revolt against the Roman Empire. In retrospect, this looks like an act of madness. Palestine was a small and insignificant part of the world-wide empire which had just won a crushing victory against the rival power — the Parthian Empire (Persia) — and put down a major rebellion in Britain. What chances could the Jewish revolt have? God knows what was going on in the mind of the \Zealots\. They eliminated the moderate leaders, who warned against provoking the empire, and gained sway over the Jewish population of the country. They relied on God. Perhaps they also relied on the Jews in Rome and believed that their influence over the Senate would restrain the Emperor, Nero. Perhaps they had heard that Nero was weak and about to fall. We know how it ended: after three years, the rebels were crushed, Jerusalem fell and the temple was burned down. The last of the Zealots committed suicide in Masada. The Zionists did indeed try to learn from history. They acted in a rational way, did not provoke the great powers, endeavored in every situation to attain what was possible. They accepted compromises, and every compromise served them as a basis for the next surge forward. They cleverly utilized the radical stance of their adversaries and gained the sympathy of the whole world. But since the beginning of the occupation, their mind has become clouded. The cult of Masada has become dominant. Divine promises once again start to play a role in public discourse. Large parts of the public are following the new zealots. The next phase is also repeating itself: the leaders of Israel are starting a rebellion against the new Rome. WHAT BEGAN as an insult to the Vice President of the United States is developing into something far bigger. The mouse has given birth to an elephant. Lately, the ultra-right government in Jerusalem has started to treat President Barack Obama with thinly veiled contempt. The fears that arose in Jerusalem at the beginning of his term have dissipated. Obama looks to them like a paper black panther. He gave up his demand for a real settlement freeze. Every time he was spat on, he remarked that it was raining. Yet now, ostensibly quite suddenly, the measure is full. Obama, his Vice President and his senior assistants condemn the Netanyahu government with growing severity. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has submitted an ultimatum: Netanyahu must stop all settlement activity, East Jerusalem included; he must agree to negotiate about all core problems of the conflict, including East Jerusalem, and more. The surprise was complete. Obama, it seems, has crossed the Rubicon, much as the Egyptian army had crossed the Suez Canal in 1973. Netanyahu gave the order to mobilize all the reserves in America and to move forward all the diplomatic tanks. All Jewish organizations in the US were commanded to join the campaign. AIPAC blew the shofar and ordered its soldiers, the Senators and Congressmen, to storm the White House. It seems that the decisive battle has been joined. The Israeli leaders were certain that Obama would be defeated. And then an unusual noise was heard: the sound of the doomsday weapon. THE MAN who decided to activate it was a foe of a new kind. David Petraeus is the most popular officer of the United States army. The four-star general, son of a Dutch sea captain who went to America when his country was overrun by the Nazis, stood out from early childhood. In West Point he was a \distinguished cadet\, in Army Command and General Staff College he was No. 1. As a combat commander, he reaped plaudits. He wrote his doctoral thesis (on the lessons of Vietnam) at Princeton and served as an assistant professor for international relations in the US Military Academy. He made his mark in Iraq, when he commanded the forces in Mosul, the most problematical city in the country. He concluded that in order to vanquish the enemies of the US he must win over the hearts of the civilian population, acquire local allies and spend more money than ammunition. The locals called him King David. His success was considered so outstanding that his methods were adopted as the official doctrine of the American army. His star rose rapidly. He was appointed commander of the coalition forces in Iraq and soon became the chief of the Central Command of the US army, which covers the whole Middle East , except Israel and Palestine (which \belong\ to the American command in Europe). When such a person raises his voice, the American people listen. As a respected military thinker, he has no rivals. THIS WEEK, Petraeus conveyed an unequivocal message: after reviewing the problems in his AOR (Area Of Responsibility) — which includes, among others, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Yemen — he turned to what he called the \root causes of instability\ in the region. The list was topped by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In his report to the Armed Services Committee he stated: \The enduring hostilities between Israel and some of its neighbors present distinct challenges to our ability to advance our interests in the AOR...The conflict foments anti-American sentiment, due to a perception of U.S. favoritism for Israel. Arab anger over the Palestinian question limits the strength and depth of U.S. partnerships with governments and peoples in the AOR and weakens the legitimacy of moderate regimes in the Arab world. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda and other militant groups exploit that anger to mobilize support. The conflict also gives Iran influence in the Arab world through its clients, Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas.\ Not content with that, Petraeus sent his officers to present his conclusions to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, In other words: Israeli-Palestinian peace is not a private matter between the two parties, but a supreme national interest of the USA. That means that the US must give up its one-sided support for the Israeli government and impose the two-state solution. The argument as such is not new. Several experts have said more or less the same in the past. (Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, I wrote in a similar vein and prophesied that the US would change its policy. It did not happen then.) But now this is being stated in an official document written by the responsible American commander. The Netanyahu government immediately went into damage-limitation mode. Its spokespersons declared that Petraeus represents a narrow military approach, that he doesnt understand political matters, that his reasoning is faulty. But it is not this that made people in Jerusalem break out into cold sweat. AS IS well known, the pro-Israel lobby dominates the American political system without limits — almost. Every American politician and senior official is mortally afraid of it. The slightest deviation from the strict AIPAC line is tantamount to political suicide. But in the armor of this political Goliath there is a chink. Like Achilles heel, the immense might of the pro-Israel lobby has a vulnerable point that, when touched, can neutralize its power. It was illustrated by the Jonathan Pollard affair. This American-Jewish employee of a sensitive intelligence agency spied for Israel. Israelis consider him a national hero, a Jew who did his duty to his people. But for the US intelligence community, he is a traitor who endangered the lives of many American agents. Not satisfied with a routine penalty, it induced the court to impose a life sentence. Since then, all American presidents have refused the requests of successive Israeli governments to commute the sentence. No president dared to confront his intelligence chiefs in this matter. But the most significant side of this affair is reminiscent of the famous words of Sherlock Holmes about the dogs that did not bark. AIPAC did not bark. The entire American Jewish community fell silent. Almost nobody raised their voice for poor Pollard. Why? Because most American Jews are ready to do anything — just anything — for the government of Israel. With one exception: they will not do anything that appears to hurt the security of the United States. When the flag of security is hoisted, the Jews, like all Americans, snap to attention and salute. The Damocles sword of suspicion of disloyalty hangs above their heads. For them, this is the ultimate nightmare: to be accused of putting the security of Israel ahead of the security of the US. Therefore it is important for them to repeat endlessly the mantra that the interests of Israel and the US are identical. And now comes the most important general of the US Army and says that this is not so. The policy of the present Israeli government is endangering the lives of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. FOR NOW, this is being said only as a side remark, in a military document that has not been widely aired. But the sword has been drawn from its scabbard - and American Jews have started to tremble at the distant rumble of an approaching earthquake. This week, Netanyahus brother-in-law has used our own doomsday weapon. He declared that Obama is an \anti-Semite\. The official newspaper of the Shas party has asserted that Obama is really a Muslim. They represent the radical right and its allies, who argue in speech and in writing that \Hussein\ Obama is a Jew-hating black who must be beaten in the coming congressional elections and in the next presidential ones. (Yet an important poll in Israel published yesterday shows that the Israeli public is far from convinced by these insinuations: the vast majority believes that Obamas treatment of Israel is fair. Indeed, Obama got higher marks than Netanyahu.) If Obama decides to fight back and activate his doomsday weapon - the accusation that Israel puts the lives of American servicemen at risk - this would have catastrophic consequences for Israel. For the time being, this is only a shot across the bow - a warning shot fired by a warship in order to induce another vessel to follow its instructions. The warning is clear. Even if the •present crisis is somehow damped down, it will inevitably flare up again and again as long as the present coalition in Israel stays in power. When the movie \Hurt Locker\ won its awards, the entire American public was united in its concern about the lives of its soldiers in the Middle East. If this public becomes convinced that Israel is sticking a knife in their back, it will be a disaster for Netanyahu. And not just for him.

C05762745	Dear Secretary Clinton, I hope that your elbow is healing quickly. I mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the region from the Persian Gulf to the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. Below are key findings from the report, but the main takeaway is that the political impact of Chinese military modernization may be greater than a narrow technical analysis of Chinas capabilities would suggest, and for a range of reasons, technical and political, prospects for regional cooperation are limited, but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing. All best, Jackie Key findings from the workshop include: • Chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than forecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of US carrier battle groups within 1,000 kilometers of the Chinese coastline. • The Indian Ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of SSBNs from countries with limited experience in sustained SSBN patrols, including India, China, and possibly Pakistan. • Chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area have continued to develop, with a new friendly relationship emerging with Sri Lanka, to complement the existing relations with Myanmar and Pakistan. This may lead to a new form of \blue-brown water\ naval operations, in which Chinese naval forces operate far from Chinese bases, but close to the coasts of client states. The workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation easy. These trends include: Japanese concern that Chinese dominance in the waters within 1,000 miles of Chinese territory has immediate consequences for Japans maritime autonomy. • Indian suspicion of Chinese naval developments in Hainan Island, Chinese development of port infrastructure in Pakistan and Myanmar, and the possibility of Chinese ballistic missile submarines operating close to India. • Indian interest in SSBNs, plus Chinese SSBN ports in Hainan and even, possibly, Pakistani SSBNs, all of which creates the possibility of multiple SSBN patrols in the Indian Ocean, along with the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea. • Asymmetries in levels of operational competence, and technology, in submarines and maritime aviation, which, for example, make functional multi-national naval cooperation harder for states that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses. • The major role of land-based maritime warfare strike complexes in this region, which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in homeland areas. The report also offers two scenarios under which the United States may consider engaging militarily in the region. The first scenario, which concerns a clash between Japan and China in waters claimed by both, compels us to consider: • The circumstances under which the Chinese may seek to demonstrate that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected, and • What the United States would lose if it did not support the Japanese, and then faced a world in which Japan became either a subordinate power to China or a nuclear armed state, capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the United States. The second scenario concerns an American naval blockade of an Iran that has tested a nuclear weapon, potentially giving rise to an interaction between the United States and China far from the operating bases of each but close to territory of a client of China, a \blue-brown water\ clash. In this scenario, China is using its navy to show presence, and to force the United States to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with China over a political conflict that is less than black and white. Thinking about the options that would be left to the United States under these circumstances underscores how Chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than a narrow assessment of their military capabilities would suggest.

The Liberal Democrat leader said Barack Obamas administration \understood the world had changed\ and the UKs leaders needed to end their \slavish\ devotion to Washington. Mr Clegg also warned against \sabre-rattling\ over Irans nuclear ambitions and repeated his pledge to offer a referendum on the UKs continued membership of the European Union when the issue next arose. The Lib Dems have ruled out replacing Trident with a like-for-like system and Mr Clegg said the UK should consider \not having a continuous at sea deterrent\. In a speech to the Foreign Press Association in London, Mr Clegg said it was time to challenge the \conventional wisdom\ that had lasted since the Suez crisis about the UKs relationship with the US. He said: \I think it's sometimes rather embarrassing the way Conservative and Labour politicians talk in this kind of slavish way about the special relationship. If you speak to hard-nosed folk in Washington they think 'it's a good relationship but it's not the special relationship'.\

C05767347	sbwhoeop Monday, February 22, 2010 5:40 PM H: Just fyi. Whats going around...Les Gelb... Sid ambling Over Rahm by Leslie H. Gelb February 22, 2010 I 3:26pm - L - Alex Brandon / AP Photo Leslie H. Gelbs call for White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to be reassigned spurred a circle-the-wagons reaction from pro- (or perhaps even anti-) Rahm forces. Gelb sifts the fallout for clues. When you write that the president of the United States should replace his chief of staff, someone will fire back. So it was that Rahm Emanuel apparently struck back at my piece last week on the Daily Beast through a column in Sundays Washington Post. Only this time, the return fire had a rare twist, one that could produce Washington convulsions. It was seemingly aimed at me (and others who published suggestions of Emanuels limitations as chief). But whether it was intentional or not, the volley actually struck the president himself. Here is the story, a very Washington tale of stretching permissible criticism of power holders, of pungent media leaks, of labyrinthine speculation as to who is doing what to whom. Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a \traitor\ to the boss. With a headline \Replace Rahm,\ I wrote last Tuesday that Emanuel lacked the managerial skills, discipline, and strategic ability to get things done as chief of staff. I argued he should be moved over to a political adviser slot, where his considerable, can-do talents would better serve his boss. I targeted others as well, mostly in Mr. Obamas Chicago crowd. Several writers also blasted this crowd, mostly with unsigned bullets, but never crossed the red line calling for their removal. I wrote the piece because it essentially reflected the waves of anti-White House staff critiques breaking over Washington, but rarely heard outside its drawing rooms. I did it because I believed the president was running out of chances to succeed and needed better and tougher staffers. I did it because if he failed, the nation failed. Then came the inevitable blast back, a devastating leak, in a piece by Dana Milbank, a respected Washington journalist. Interesting that the leaker selected Milbank. Hes sort of a half-reporter, half-columnist who roams the entire capital city, not just the White House. The leaker must have felt safe because Milbank has so many sources all over town, making the leakers harder to trace. The Milbank headline read: \Why Obama needs Rahm at the top.\ It began: \Let us now praise Rahm Emanuel. No, seriously.\ Then, he lists me and a couple others who also criticized Rahm. \But,\ he continued, \sacking Emanuel is the last thing the president should do.\ Then, Milbank (and presumably the leaker) delivered the surprise and wounding blow – to the president himself. \Obamas first year fell apart in large part because he didnt follow his chief of staffs advice on crucial matters. Arguably, Emanuel is the only person keeping Obama from becoming Jimmy Carter.\ Then, Milbank (and the leaker) took his first shot, not at me, but at congressional liberals and everyone in the Chicago crowd except Rahm. \Obamas problem,\ Milbank continued, \is that his other confidants—particularly Valerie Jarrett and Robert Gibbs, and, to a lesser extent, David Axelrod—are part of the Cult of Obama. In love with the president, they believe he is a transformational figure who neednt dirty his hands in politics.\ So, it was \their\ fault—until you see the real blow landed beyond them and on the President himself. \The president would have been better off heeding Emanuels counsel,\ but instead \overruled\ him on several key Rahm recommendations: not rushing to close Guantanamo and bringing terrorists to U.S. prisons, not trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York, and going for a smaller health care bill focused on popular items with Republican support. \The result was,\ Milbank wrote, \as the world now knows, disastrous.\ In other words, Mr. Obama could have thrived and saved himself on key issues had he only listened to Rahm. It sure looks like Rahm (or someone near and dear to him) trying to save himself at the president's expense. This is an incredibly unusual leak, seemingly a chief of staff undermining his own boss, the president. Worse, it details specific advice Rahm personally gave Mr. Obama in the absolute privacy of the Oval Office. Presidents go crazy at such breaches of confidence. Which is why another possibility has to be considered: that Rahm was not the leaker. The leak was so egregious, so anti- Chicago crowd minus Rahm, so devastating to the president, that Emanuel couldn't have been stupid enough to leak a story where he was the sole, surviving hero. Remember, too, that my piece did not recommend kicking Rahm out of the White House, just sliding him over into a political adviser job where he could practice small-bite pragmatism. Maybe someone didn't want Rahm around the White House at all, in any position. Maybe the leaker thought the way to get rid of Rahm completely was to brand him as a \traitor\ to the boss. Maybe the leaker belonged to that contingent of self- mutilating liberal Democrats who have always viewed Rahm as too centrist and pragmatic. Of course, I don't know what's afoot. And of course, Milbank put his own views into his own article. But someone gave him the specifics, the precious ammunition about Rahm's private advice to Mr. Obama. The story is not over. Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and use power in the 21st century.

Even before the earthquake, there were in Haiti up to 300,000 restaveks (children given away or sold by their parents and enslaved as domestic servants), as well as reports that members of MINUSTAH used trafficked women in prostitution. In the 2009 TIP Report Haiti was classified as a Special Case country with governance so dysfunctional it could not be ranked. The initial disaster response is focusing on immediate needs of food, shelter, and medical care, but has thus far not addressed TIP prevention and protection issues. While attention is being paid to the problems of orphans and adoptees, TIP was not adequately addressed in the UN's initial flash appeal, so it is unclear which agency in the international system has the lead on the ground. UNICEF has the child protection lead, UNFPA leads prevention of sexual and gender-based violence, and IOM is tasked with shelter and camp management. We will work to remedy, in a subsequent appeal, the omission of TIP from the operational plan. We are moving to redirect $1 million of program funds that G/TIP has on Hispaniola and to reprogram an additional $550,000; we will work with PRM to identify other funding possibilities. Working through existing grantees and other experienced NG0s, it is our intention to help resuscitate police child protection brigades that already exist in Haiti, to rebuild capacity of Haitian organizations that protect restaveks, to prevent traffickers in the Dominican Republic from enslaving displaced Haitians on farms and in prostitution, and to educate Haitian parents of the risks of giving their children away in this time of crisis. We will consult with partner agencies to ensure that the U.S. presence does not contribute to trafficking. It will be important for the Department's messaging to convey our commitment to fighting human trafficking in both the immediate and long term. SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED

C05778454	THE NBC/YORKER December 14, 2010 The Envoy Posted by Hendrik Hertzberg Last night, as I was unlocking my bike on a windswept Greenwich Village sidewalk after leaving a holiday party, a friend approached, cell phone in hand. A few minutes earlier, she and I had been inside, chatting happily amid the buzz and warmth of a holiday party. Now she had tears in her eyes. \Richard Holbrooke died,\ she said. Notwithstanding the hospital bulletins since he fell ill on Saturday—critical condition, damaged aorta, emergency surgery—this sudden, awful ending was a shock, because Richard Holbrooke was such an astounding volcano of vitality. Everything about him was large: his physical size, including the ultimate \in your face\ face, a face like a Times Square billboard; his buzz-saw voice, a highly expressive instrument, equally adept at piano (a side-of-the-mouth, gossipy wisecrack, often pleasingly nasty) and forte (a high-decibel outburst of anger or indignation, almost always calculated for effect); his appetites (for experience, for danger, for praise, for power, for fun); and his ambitions (for himself, for his beliefs, for the United States, for the world). He was no doe-eyed peacenik, but as a diplomat he labored long and hard to seek alternatives to war and ways to end particular wars. He was sentimental about his own unsentimentality, romantic about his own tough-guy realism. Unlike my tearful informant, who had known Holbrooke as a family friend since she was a little girl, I was acquainted with him in the casual way of many journalists and editors. He was a peer as well as a \source,\ a prolific and forceful writer whose favorite venues, The New Republic and The New Yorker, happened to be the places where I've spent my working life. He was gregarious and fond of big, splashy black-tie evenings. The last time I saw him was six weeks ago, on November 1st, at the New York Public Library's \Literary Lions\ celebration. At the pre-dinner reception, where he would normally have been on his feet, looming large, he repaired to a folding chair behind a little table and let his wife, Kati Marton, bring the party to him. At sixty-nine he was tired—that much was obvious—but he was as sharp and voluble as ever. He still had plenty to do. Not long after Holbrooke achieved his greatest diplomatic triumph by negotiating the 1995 end to the Balkan wars, I asked him if he liked Warren Zevon's wonderful song \The Envoy.\ He said he'd never heard of it. The next day I sent him a CD. After that, he mentioned it every single time I've seen him, up to and including that NYPL gala, saying he puts it on, loud, when he needs a lift. And no wonder: his life was a drama, and he liked it that way. If the Supreme Court had allowed the votes to be counted in 2000, then the Envoy, almost certainly, would have become the Secretary of State, and the next decade would have unfolded very differently. As it is, Holbrooke has left a stronger, more positive, more creative mark on history than all but a few of those who have held that post. He certainly did not die of a broken heart—Kati Marton saw to that—but it was surely the ghastly, impossible demands of his last, impossible assignment that brought on the rending of his aorta. He died for his country as surely as any soldier. And his deathbed words may turn out to be the most important he ever spoke.

Person of Interest: United States UN Ambassador Susan Rice Oct 8, 2012 iloo AM EDT Leslie H. Gelb A diplomat under fire. With the presidential campaign drowning in boredom, commentators were desperately searching for news, preferably a new victim, to brighten their days. And along came Susan Rice. A couple Sundays ago, the U.N. ambassador made the mistake of appearing on the talk shows to insist that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was \spontaneous\ rather than a terrorist plot. You would have thought she had said that the pope was a Mormon. Out came the Washington daggers. She lied. She was a shill. Benghazi was no spontaneous event. It was the work of an al Qaeda offshoot. The White House had fumbled key intelligence information and was now trying to cover up its unforgivable mistake. Rice was just covering up for the president. Her reward would be Obama's nominating her to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of State. The commentariat immediately rolled out plans to nail Rice and the Obama team to the wall. Peter King, the Grand Inquisitor of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, pledged to \investigate\ and hold hearings. And that, said the commentariat, would be the end of Rice's hopes to become the new Hillary. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739637 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM. SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Now, let's take an unfashionable step back and examine the facts, such as they are. Rice did not make up the \spontaneous\ story or have it handed to her by White House conspirators. She got it from the same daily intelligence brief given to the president. Those daily intel reports told the very story Rice repeated publicly, i.e., that the Benghazi mob formed more or less on its own, mainly in reaction to the American video cartooning sacred Muslim figures, and that extremists then took advantage to kill, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Rice didn't make up that story. The problem was not with Rice; it was with the inevitably complicated U.S. intelligence process. Her mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value. The White House biiefers made the same error, and so did I. I too repeated in an op-ed on The Daily Beast what the intelligence briefers told me, but I knew very well that more and contradictory information would appear soon enough. It always does. Sure, the CIA had additional intel from the start, but it hadn't begun to sift through all the communications intercepts, satellite photos, and human reports. It always takes time to sort out facts from fictions and find consistent threads. Seemingly, this gossamer information is now taking shape. Meantime, Rice is still very much in the running for the job at Fogg' Bottom, along with Senator John Kerry, NSC Adviser Tom Donilon, and former diplomat Nicholas Burns, now of Harvard. She was Obama's earliest loyalist in the foreign-policy crowd, and he still likes her, despite lackluster reports on her performance at the U.N. The smears, though flatly inaccurate, won't help her either. What will help her and, more importantly a flagging Obama after the first debate, is hunting down the Benghazi culprits.

C05769954	The Runaway General Stanley McChrystal, Obamas top commander in Afghanistan, has seized control of the war by never taking his eye off the real enemy: The wimps in the White House By Michael Hastings Jun 22, 2010 10:00 AM EDT This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010. Howed I get screwed into going to this dinner?\ demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It's a Thursday night in mid-April, and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four-star suite at the HOtel Westminster in Paris. He's in France to sell his new war strategy to our NATO allies — to keep up the fiction, in essence, that we actually have allies. Since McChrystal took over a year ago, the Afghan war has become the exclusive property of the United States. Opposition to the war has already toppled the Dutch government, forced the resignation of Germany's president and sparked both Canada and the Netherlands to announce the withdrawal of their 4,500 troops. McChrystal is in Paris to keep the French, who have lost more than 40 soldiers in Afghanistan, from going all wobbly on him. \The dinner comes with the position, sir,\ says his chief of staff, Col. Charlie Flynn. McChrystal turns sharply in his chair. \Hey, Charlie,\ he asks, \does this come with the position?\ McChrystal gives him the middle finger. The general stands and looks around the suite that his traveling staff of 10 has converted into a full-scale operations center. The tables are crowded with silver Panasonic Toughbooks, and blue cables crisscross the hotel's thick carpet, hooked up to satellite dishes to provide encrypted phone and e-mail communications. Dressed in off-the-rack civilian casual — blue tie, button-down shirt, dress slacks — McChrystal is way out of his comfort zone. Paris, as one of his advisers says, is the \most anti-McChrystal city you can imagine.\ The general hates fancy restaurants, rejecting any place with candles on the tables as too \Gucci.\ He prefers Bud Light Lime (his favorite beer) to Bordeaux, Talladega Nights (his favorite movie) to Jean-Luc Godard. Besides, the public eye has never been a place where McChrystal felt comfortable: Before President Obama put him in charge of the war in Afghanistan, he spent five years running the Pentagon's most secretive black ops. \Whats the update on the Kandahar bombing?\ McChrystal asks Flynn. The city has been rocked by two massive car bombs in the past day alone, calling into question the generals assurances that he can wrest it from the Taliban. \We have two KIAs, but that hasn't been confirmed,\ Flynn says. McChrystal takes a final look around the suite. At 55, he is gaunt and lean, not unlike an older version of Christian Bale in Rescue Dawn. His slate-blue eyes have the unsettling ability to drill down when they lock on you. If youve fucked up or disappointed him, they can destroy your soul without the need for him to raise his voice. \Id rather have my ass kicked by a roomful of people than go out to this dinner,\ McChrystal says. He pauses a beat. \Unfortunately,\ he adds, \no one in this room could do it.\ With that, he's out the door. \Whos he going to dinner with?\ I ask one of his aides. \Some French minister,\ the aide tells me. \Its fucking gay.\ The next morning, McChrystal and his team gather to prepare for a speech he is giving at the Ecole Militaire, a French military academy. The general prides himself on being sharper and ballsier than anyone else, but his brashness comes with a price: Although McChrystal has been in charge of the war for only a year, in that short time he has managed to piss off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict. Last fall, during the question-and-answer session following a speech he gave in London, McChrystal dismissed the counterterrorism strategy being advocated by Vice President Joe Biden as \shortsighted,\ saying it would lead to a state of \Chaos-istan.\ The remarks earned him a smackdown from the president himself, who summoned the general to a terse private meeting aboard Air Force One. The message to McChrystal seemed clear: Shut the fuck up, and keep a lower profile Now, flipping through printout cards of his speech in Paris, McChrystal wonders aloud what Biden question he might get today, and how he should respond. \I never know whats going to pop out until Im up there, thats the problem,\ he says. Then, unable to help themselves, he and his staff imagine the general dismissing the vice president with a good one- liner. \Are you asking about Vice President Biden?\ McChrystal says with a laugh. \Whos that?\ \Biden?\ suggests a top adviser. \Did you say: Bite Me?\ When Barack Obama entered the Oval Office, he immediately set out to deliver on his most important campaign promise on foreign policy: to refocus the war in Afghanistan on what led us to invade in the first place. \I want the American people to understand,\ he announced in March 2009. \We have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\ He ordered another 21,000 troops to Kabul, the largest increase since the war began in 2001. Taking the advice of both the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he also fired Gen. David McKiernan — then the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan — and replaced him with a man he didn't know and had met only briefly: Gen. Stanley McChrystal. It was the first time a top general had been relieved from duty during wartime in more than 50 years, since Harry Truman fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War. Even though he had voted for Obama, McChrystal and his new commander in chief failed from the outset to connect. The general first encountered Obama a week after he took office, when the president met with a dozen senior military officials in a room at the Pentagon known as the Tank. According to sources familiar with the meeting, McChrystal thought Obama looked \uncomfortable and intimidated\ by the roomful of military brass. Their first one-on-one meeting took place in the Oval Office four months later, after McChrystal got the Afghanistan job, and it didn't go much better. \It was a 10-minute photo op,\ says an adviser to McChrystal. \Obama clearly didnt know anything about him, who he was. Heres the guy whos going to run his fucking war, but he didnt seem very engaged. The Boss was pretty disappointed.\ From the start, McChrystal was determined to place his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency. COIN, as the theory is known, is the new gospel of the Pentagon brass, a doctrine that attempts to square the military's preference for high-tech violence with the demands of fighting protracted wars in failed states. COIN calls for sending huge numbers of ground troops to not only destroy the enemy, but to live among the civilian population and slowly rebuild, or build from scratch, another nation's government — a process that even its staunchest advocates admit requires years, if not decades, to achieve. The theory essentially rebrands the military, expanding its authority (and its funding) to encompass the diplomatic and political sides of warfare: Think the Green Berets as an armed Peace Corps. In 2006, after Gen. David Petraeus beta-tested the theory during his \surge\ in Iraq, it quickly gained a hardcore following of think-tankers, journalists, military officers and civilian officials. Nicknamed \COINdinistas\ for their cultish zeal, this influential cadre believed the doctrine would be the perfect solution for Afghanistan. All they needed was a general with enough charisma and political savvy to implement it. As McChrystal leaned on Obama to ramp up the war, he did it with the same fearlessness he used to track down terrorists in Iraq: Figure out how your enemy operates, be faster and more ruthless than everybody else, then take the fuckers out. After arriving in Afghanistan last June, the general conducted his own policy review, ordered up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The now-infamous report was leaked to the press, and its conclusion was dire: If we didn't send another 40,000 troops — swelling the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan by nearly half — we were in danger of \mission failure.\ The White House was furious. McChrystal, they felt, was trying to bully Obama, opening him up to charges of being weak on national security unless he did what the general wanted. It was Obama versus the Pentagon, and the Pentagon was determined to kick the president's ass. Last fall, with his top general calling for more troops, Obama launched a three-month review to re-evaluate the strategy in Afghanistan. \I found that time painful,\ McChrystal tells me in one of several lengthy interviews. \I was selling an unsellable position.\ For the general, it was a crash course in Beltway politics — a battle that pitted him against experienced Washington insiders like Vice President Biden, who argued that a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan would plunge America into a military quagmire without weakening international terrorist networks. \The entire COIN strategy is a fraud perpetuated on the American people,\ says Douglas Macgregor, a retired colonel and leading critic of counterinsurgency who attended West Point with McChrystal. \The idea that we are going to spend a trillion dollars to reshape the culture of the Islamic world is utter nonsense. In the end, however, McChrystal got almost exactly what he wanted. On December 1st, in a speech at West Point, the president laid out all the reasons why fighting the war in Afghanistan is a bad idea: Its expensive; were in an economic crisis; a decade-long commitment would sap American power; Al Qaeda has shifted its base of operations to Pakistan. Then, without ever using the words \victory\ or \win,\ Obama announced that he would send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, almost as many as McChrystal had requested. The president had thrown his weight, however hesitantly, behind the counterinsurgency crowd. Today, as McChrystal gears up for an offensive in southern Afghanistan, the prospects for any kind of success look bleak. In June, the death toll for U.S. troops passed 1,000, and the number of IEDs has doubled. Spending hundreds of billions of dollars on the fifth-poorest country on earth has failed to win over the civilian population, whose attitude toward U.S. troops ranges from intensely wary to openly hostile. Thetiggest military operation of the year — a ferocious offensive that began in February to retake the southern town of Marja — continues to drag on, prompting McChrystal himself to refer to it as a \bleeding ulcer.\ In June, Afghanistan officially outpaced Vietnam as the longest war in American history — and Obama has quietly begun to back away from the deadline he set for withdrawing U.S. troops in July of next year. The president finds himself stuck in something even more insane than a quagmire: a quagmire he knowingly walked into, even though its precisely the kind of gigantic, mind-numbing, multigenerational nation-building project he explicitly said he didnt want. Even those who support McChrystal and his strategy of counterinsurgency know that whatever the general manages to accomplish in Afghanistan, its going to look more like Vietnam than Desert Storm. \Its not going to look like a win, smell like a win or taste like a win,\ says Maj. Gen. Bill Mayville, who serves as chief of operations for McChrystal. \This is going to end in an argument.\ The night after his speech in Paris, McChrystal and his staff head to Kitty O'Shea's, an Irish pub catering to tourists, around the corner from the hotel. His wife, Annie, has joined him for a rare visit: Since the Iraq War began in 2003, she has seen her husband less than 30 days a year. Though it is his and Annie's 33rd wedding anniversary, McChrystal has invited his inner circle along for dinner and drinks at the \least Gucci\ place his staff could find. His wife isn't surprised. \He once took me to a Jack in the Box when I was dressed in formalwear,\ she says with a laugh. The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs. There's a former head of British Special Forces, two Navy Seals, an Afghan Special Forces commando, a lawyer, two fighter pilots and at least two dozen combat veterans and counterinsurgency experts. They jokingly refer to themselves as Team America, taking the name from the South Park-esque sendup of military cluelessness, and they pride themselves on their can-do attitude and their disdain for authority. After arriving in Kabul last summer, Team America set about changing the culture of the International Security Assistance Force, as the NATO-led mission is known. (U.S. soldiers had taken to deriding ISAF as short for \I Suck at Fighting\ or \In Sandals and Flip-Flops.\) McChrystal banned alcohol on base, kicked out Burger King and other symbols of American excess, expanded the morning briefing to include thousands of officers and refashioned the command center into a Situational Awareness Room, a free-flowing information hub modeled after Mayor Mike Bloomberg's offices in New York. He also set a manic pace for his staff, becoming legendary for sleeping four hours a night, running seven miles each morning, and eating one meal a day. (In the month I spend around the general, I witness him eating only once.) It's a kind of superhuman narrative that has built up around him, a staple in almost every media profile, as if the ability to go without sleep and food translates into the possibility of a man single-handedly winning the war. By midnight at Kitty O'Shea's, much of Team America is completely shitfaced. Two officers do an Irish jig mixed with steps from a traditional Afghan wedding dance, while McChrystal's top advisers lock arms and sing a slurred song of their own invention.\Afghanistan!\ they bellow.\Afghanistan!\ They call it their Afghanistan song. McChrystal steps away from the circle, observing his team. \All these men,\ he tells me. \Id die for them. And theyd die for me.\ The assembled men may look and sound like a bunch of combat veterans letting off steam, but in fact this tight-knit group represents the most powerful force shaping U.S. policy in Afghanistan. While McChrystal and his men are in indisputable command of all military aspects of the war, there is no equivalent position on the diplomatic or political side. Instead, an assortment of administration players compete over the Afghan portfolio: U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, Special Representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke, National Security Advisor Jim Jones and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, not to mention 40 or so other coalition ambassadors and a host of talking heads who try to insert themselves into the mess, from John Kerry to John McCain. This diplomatic incoherence has effectively allowed McChrystal's team to call the shots and hampered efforts to build a stable and credible government in Afghanistan. \It jeopardizes the mission,\ says Stephen Biddle, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who supports McChrystal. \The military cannot by itself create governance reform.\ Part of the problem is structural: The Defense Department budget exceeds $600 billion a year, while the State Department receives only $50 billion. But part of the problem is personal: In private, Team McChrystal likes to talk shit about many of Obama's top people on the diplomatic side. One aide calls Jim Jones, a retired four-star general and veteran of the Cold War, a \clown\ who remains \stuck in 1985.\ Politicians like McCain and Kerry, says another aide, \turn up, have a meeting with Karzai, criticize him at the airport press conference, then get back for the Sunday talk shows. Frankly, its not very helpful.\ Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews from McChrystals inner circle. \Hillary had Stan's back during the strategic review,\ says an adviser. \She said, 'If Stan wants it, give him what he needs.'\ McChrystal reserves special skepticism for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating the Taliban. \The Boss says he's like a wounded animal,\ says a member of the generals team. \Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that hes going to get fired, so that makes him dangerous. Hes a brilliant guy, but he just comes in, pulls on a lever, whatever he can grasp onto. But this is COIN, and you cant just have someone yanking on shit.\ At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry. \Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,\ he groans. \I dont even want to open it.\ He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BladkBerry back in his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance. \Make sure you dont get any of that on your leg,\ an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail. By far the most crucial — and strained — relationship is between McChrystal and Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador. According to those close to the two men, Eikenberry — a retired three-star general who served in Afghanistan in 2002 and 2005 — can't stand that his former subordinate is now calling the shots. He's also furious that McChrystal, backed by NATO's allies, refused to put Eikenberry in the pivotal role of viceroy in Afghanistan, which would have made him the diplomatic equivalent of the general. The job instead went to British Ambassador Mark Sedwill — a move that effectively increased McChrystal's influence over diplomacy by shutting out a powerful rival. \In reality, that position needs to be filled by an American for it to have weight,\ says a U.S. official familiar with the negotiations. The relationship was further strained in January, when a classified cable that Eikenberry wrote was leaked to The New York Times. The cable was as scathing as it was prescient. The ambassador offered a brutal critique of McChrystal's strategy, dismissed President Hamid Karzai as \not an adequate strategic partner,\ and cast doubt on whether the counterinsurgency plan would be \sufficient\ to deal with Al Qaeda. \We will become more deeply engaged here with no way to extricate ourselves,\ Eikenberry warned, \short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and chaos.\ McChrystal and his team were blindsided by the cable. \I like Karl, Ive known him for years, but theyd never said anything like that to us before,\ says McChrystal, who adds that he felt \betrayed\ by the leak. \Heres one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, I told you so.\ The most striking example of McChrystals usurpation of diplomatic policy is his handling of Karzai. It is McChrystal, not diplomats like Eikenberry or Holbrooke, who enjoys the best relationship with the man America is relying on to lead Afghanistan. The doctrine of counterinsurgency requires a credible government, and since Karzai is not considered credible by his own people, McChrystal has worked hard to make him so. Over the past few months, he has accompanied the president on more than 10 trips around the country, standing beside him at political meetings, or shuras, in Kandahar. In February, the day before the doomed offensive in Marja, McChrystal even drove over to the presidents palace to get him to sign off on what would be the largest military operation of the year. Karzais staff, however, insisted that the president was sleeping off a cold and could not be disturbed. After several hours of haggling, McChrystal finally enlisted the aid of Afghanistans defense minister, who persuaded Karzais people to wake the president from his nap. This is one of the central flaws with McChrystals counterinsurgency strategy: The need to build a credible government puts us at the mercy of whatever tin-pot leader weve backed — a danger that Eikenberry explicitly warned about in his cable. Even Team McChrystal privately acknowledges that Karzai is a less-than-ideal partner. \He's been locked up in his palace the past year,\ laments one of the generals top advisers. At times, Karzai himself has actively undermined McChrystals desire to put him in charge. During a recent visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Karzai met three U.S. soldiers who had been wounded in Uruzgan province. \General,\ he called out to McChrystal, \I didn't even know we were fighting in Uruzgan!\ Growing up as a military brat, McChrystal exhibited the mixture of brilliance and cockiness that would follow him throughout his career. His father fought in Korea and Vietnam, retiring as a two-star general, and his four brothers all joined the armed services. Moving around to different bases, McChrystal took solace in baseball, a sport in which he made no pretense of hiding his superiority: In Little League, he would call out strikes to the crowd before whipping a fastball down the middle. McChrystal entered West Point in 1972, when the U.S. military was close to its all-time low in popularity. His class was the last to graduate before the academy started to admit women. The \Prison on the Hudson,\ as it was known then, was a potent mix of testosterone, hooliganism and reactionary patriotism. Cadets repeatedly trashed the mess hall in food fights, and birthdays were celebrated with a tradition called \rat fucking,\ which often left the birthday boy outside in the snow or mud, covered in shaving cream. \It was pretty out of control,\ says Lt. Gen. David Barno, a classmate who went on to serve as the top commander in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005. The class, filled with what Barno calls \huge talent\ and \wild-eyed teenagers with a strong sense of idealism,\ also produced Gen. Ray Odierno, the current commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. The son of a general, McChrystal was also a ringleader of the campus dissidents — a dual role that taught him how to thrive in a rigid, top-down environment while thumbing his nose at authority every chance he got. He accumulated more than 100 hours of demerits for drinking, partying and insubordination — a record that his classmates boasted made him a \century man.\ One classmate, who asked not to be named, recalls finding McChrystal passed out in the shower after downing a case of beer he had hidden under the sink. The troublemaking almost got him kicked out, and he spent hours subjected to forced marches in the Area, a paved courtyard where unruly cadets were disciplined. \I'd come visit, and I'd end up spending most of my time in the library, while Stan was in the Area,\ recalls Annie, who began dating McChrystal in 1973. McChrystal wound up ranking 298 out of a class of 855, a serious underachievement for a man widely regarded as brilliant. His most compelling work was extracurricular: As managing editor of The Pointer, the West Point literary magazine, McChrystal wrote seven short stories that eerily foreshadow many of the issues he would confront in his career. In one tale, a fictional officer complains about the difficulty of training foreign troops to fight; in another, a 19-year- old soldier kills a boy he mistakes for a terrorist. In \Brinkman's Note,\ a piece of suspense fiction, the unnamed narrator appears to be trying to stop a plot to assassinate the president. It turns out, however, that the narrator himself is the assassin, and hes able to infiltrate the White House: \The President strode in smiling. From the right coat pocket of the raincoat I carried, I slowly drew forth my 32-caliber pistol. In Brinkmans failure, I had succeeded.\ After graduation, 2nd Lt. Stanley McChrystal entered an Army that was all but broken in the wake of Vietnam. \We really felt we were a peacetime generation,\ he recalls. \There was the Gulf War, but even that didnt feel like that big of a deal.\ So McChrystal spent his career where the action was: He enrolled in Special Forces school and became a regimental commander of the 3rd Ranger Battalion in 1986. It was a dangerous position, even in peacetime — nearly two dozen Rangers were killed in training accidents during the Eighties. It was also an unorthodox career path: Most soldiers who want to climb the ranks to general dont go into the Rangers. Displaying a penchant for transforming systems he considers outdated, McChrystal set out to revolutionize the training regime for the Rangers. He introduced mixed martial arts, required every soldier to qualify with night-vision goggles on the rifle range and forced troops to build up their endurance with weekly marches involving heavy backpacks. In the late 1990s, McChrystal shrewdly improved his inside game, spending a year at Harvards Kennedy School of Government and then at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he co-authored a treatise on the merits and drawbacks of humanitarian interventionism. But as he moved up through the ranks, McChrystal relied on the skills he had learned as a troublemaking kid at West Point: knowing precisely how far he could go in a rigid military hierarchy without getting tossed out. Being a highly intelligent badass, he discovered, could take you far — especially in the political chaos that followed September 11th. \He was very focused,\ says Annie. \Even as a young officer he seemed to know what he wanted to do. I dont think his personality has changed in all these years.\ By some accounts, McChrystal's career should have been over at least two times by now. As Pentagon spokesman during the invasion of Iraq, the general seemed more like a White House mouthpiece than an up-and-coming commander with a reputation for speaking his mind. When Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made his infamous \stuff happens\ remark during the looting of Baghdad, McChrystal backed him up. A few days later, he echoed the president's Mission Accomplished gaffe by insisting that major combat operations in Iraq were over. But it was during his next stint — overseeing the military's most elite units, including the Rangers, Navy Seals and Delta Force — that McChrystal took part in a cover-up that would have destroyed the career of a lesser man. After Cpl. Pat Tillman, the former-NFL-star-turned-Ranger, was accidentally killed by his own troops in Afghanistan in April 2004, McChrystal took an active role in creating the impression that Tillman had died at the hands of Taliban fighters. He signed off on a falsified recommendation for a Silver Star that suggested Tillman had been killed by enemy fire. (McChrystal would later claim he didn't read the recommendation closely enough — a strange excuse for a commander known for his laserlike attention to minute details.) A week later, McChrystal sent a memo up the chain of command, specifically warning that President Bush should avoid mentioning the cause of Tillman's death. \If the circumstances of Corporal Tillmans death become public,\ he wrote, it could cause \public embarrassment\ for the president. \The false narrative, which McChrystal clearly helped construct, diminished Pats true actions,\ wrote Tillman's mother, Mary, in her book Boots on the Ground by Dusk. McChrystal got away with it, she added, because he was the \golden boy\ of Rumsfeld and Bush, who loved his willingness to get things done, even if it included bending the rules or skipping the chain of command. Nine days after Tillman's death, McChrystal was promoted to major general. Two years later, in 2006, McChrystal was tainted by a scandal involving detainee abuse and torture at Camp Nama in Iraq. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, prisoners at the camp were subjected to a now-familiar litany of abuse: stress positions, being dragged naked through the mud. McChrystal was not disciplined in the scandal, even though an interrogator at the camp reported seeing him inspect the prison multiple times. But the experience was so unsettling to McChrystal that he tried to prevent detainee operations from being placed under his command in Afghanistan, viewing them as a \political swamp,\ according to a U.S. official. In May 2009, as McChrystal prepared for his confirmation hearings, his staff prepared him for hard questions about Camp Nama and the Tillman cover-up. But the scandals barely made a ripple in Congress, and McChrystal was soon on his way back to Kabul to run the war in Afghanistan. The media, to a large extent, have also given McChrystal a pass on both controversies. Where Gen. Petraeus is kind of a dweeb, a teacher's pet with a Ranger's tab, McChrystal is a snake-eating rebel, a \Jedi\ commander, as Newsweek called him. He didn't care when his teenage son came home with blue hair and a mohawk. He speaks his mind with a candor rare for a high-ranking official. He asks for opinions, and seems genuinely interested in the response. He gets briefings on his iPod and listens to books on tape. He carries a custom-made set of nunchucks in his convoy engraved with his name and four stars, and his itinerary often bears a fresh quote from Bruce Lee. (\There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.\) He went out on dozens of nighttime raids during his time in Iraq, unprecedented for a top commander, and turned up on missions unannounced, with almost no entourage. \The fucking lads love Stan McChrystal,\ says a British officer who serves in Kabul. \Youd be out in Somewhere, Iraq, and someone would take a knee beside you, and a corporal would be like Who the fuck is that? And its fucking Stan McChrystal.\ It doesn't hurt that McChrystal was also extremely successful as head of the Joint Special Operations Command, the elite forces that carry out the government's darkest ops. During the Iraq surge, his team killed and captured thousands of insurgents, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq. \JSOC was a killing machine,\ says Maj. Gen. Mayville, his chief of operations. McChrystal was also open to new ways of killing. He systematically mapped out terrorist networks, targeting specific insurgents and hunting them down — often with the help of cyberfreaks traditionally shunned by the military. \The Boss would find the 24-year-old kid with a nose ring, with some fucking brilliant degree from MIT, sitting in the corner with 16 computer monitors humming,\ says a Special Forces commando who worked with McChrystal in Iraq and now serves on his staff in Kabul. \Hed say, Hey — you fucking muscleheads couldnt find lunch without help. You got to work together with these guys.\ Even in his new role as America's leading evangelist for counterinsurgency, McChrystal retains the deep-seated instincts of a terrorist hunter. To put pressure on the Taliban, he has upped the number of Special Forces units in Afghanistan from four to 19. \You better be out there hitting four or five targets tonight,\ McChrystal will tell a Navy Seal he sees in the hallway at headquarters. Then he'll add, \Im going to have to scold you in the morning for it, though.\ In fact, the general frequently finds himself apologizing for the disastrous consequences of counterinsurgency. In the first four months of this year, NATO forces killed some 90 civilians, up 76 percent from the same period in 2009 — a record that has created tremendous resentment among the very population that COIN theory is intent on winning over. In February, a Special Forces night raid ended in the deaths of two pregnant Afghan women and allegations of a cover-up, and in April, protests erupted in Kandahar after U.S. forces accidentally shot up a bus, killing five Afghans. \Weve shot an amazing number of people,\ McChrystal recently conceded. Despite the tragedies and miscues, McChrystal has issued some of the strictest directives to avoid civilian casualties that the U.S. military has ever encountered in a war zone. It's \insurgent math,\ as he calls it — for every innocent person you kill, you create 10 new enemies. He has ordered convoys to curtail their reckless driving, put restrictions on the use of air power and severely limited night raids. He regularly apologizes to Hamid Karzai when civilians are killed, and berates commanders responsible for civilian deaths. \For a while,\ says one U.S. official, \the most dangerous place to be in Afghanistan was in front of McChrystal after a civ cas incident.\ The ISAF command has even discussed ways to make not killing into something you can win an award for: There's talk of creating a new medal for \courageous restraint,\ a buzzword that's unlikely to gain much traction in the gung-ho culture of the U.S. military. But however strategic they may be, McChrystal's new marching orders have caused an intense backlash among his own troops. Being told to hold their fire, soldiers complain, puts them in greater danger. \Bottom line?\ says a former Special Forces operator who has spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan. \I would love to kick McChrystal in the nuts. His rules of engagement put soldiers lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.\ In March, McChrystal traveled to Combat Outpost JFM — a small encampment on the outskirts of Kandahar — to confront such accusations from the troops directly. It was a typically bold move by the general. Only two days earlier, he had received an e-mail from Israel Arroyo, a 25-year-old staff sergeant who asked McChrystal to go on a mission with his unit. \I am writing because it was said you dont care about the troops and have made it harder to defend ourselves,\ Arroyo wrote. Within hours, McChrystal responded personally: \Im saddened by the accusation that I dont care about soldiers, as it is something I suspect any soldier takes both personally and professionally — at least I do. But I know perceptions depend upon your perspective at the time, and I respect that every soldiers view is his own.\ Then he showed up at Arroyos outpost and went on a foot patrol with the troops — not some bullshit photo-op stroll through a market, but a real live operation in a dangerous war zone. Six weeks later, just before McChrystal returned from Paris, the general received another e-mail from Arroyo. A 23-year- old corporal named Michael Ingram — one of the soldiers McChrystal had gone on patrol with — had been killed by an IED a day earlier. It was the third man the 25-member platoon had lost in a year, and Arroyo was writing to see if the general would attend Ingrams memorial service. \He started to look up to you,\ Arroyo wrote. McChrystal said he would try to make it down to pay his respects as soon as possible. The night before the general is scheduled to visit Sgt. Arroyos platoon for the memorial, I arrive at Combat Outpost JFM to speak with the soldiers he had gone on patrol with. JFM is a small encampment, ringed by high blast walls and guard towers. Almost all of the soldiers here have been on repeated combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and have seen some of the worst fighting of both wars. But they are especially angered by Ingrams death. His commanders had repeatedly requested permission to tear down the house where Ingram was killed, noting that it was often used as a combat position by the Taliban. But due to McChrystals new restrictions to avoid upsetting civilians, the request had been denied. \These were abandoned houses,\ fumes Staff Sgt. Kennith Hicks. \Nobody was coming back to live in them.\ One soldier shows me the list of new regulations the platoon was given. \Patrol only in areas that you are reasonably certain that you will not have to defend yourselves with lethal force,\ the laminated card reads. For a soldier who has traveled halfway around the world to fight, thats like telling a cop he should only patrol in areas where he knows he wont have to make arrests. \Does that make any fucking sense?\ asks Pfc. Jared Pautsch. \We should just drop a fucking bomb on this place. You sit and ask yourself: What are we doing here?\ The rules handed out here are not what McChrystal intended — theyve been distorted as they passed through the chain of command — but knowing that does nothing to lessen the anger of troops on the ground. \Fuck, when I came over here and heard that McChrystal was in charge, I thought we would get our fucking gun on,\ says Hicks, who has served three tours of combat. \I get COIN. I get all that. McChrystal comes here, explains it, it makes sense. But then he goes away on his bird, and by the time his directives get passed down to us through Big Army, theyre all fucked up — either because somebody is trying to cover their ass, or because they just dont understand it themselves. But were fucking losing this thing.\ McChrystal and his team show up the next day. Underneath a tent, the general has a 45-minute discussion with some two dozen soldiers. The atmosphere is tense. \I ask you whats going on in your world, and I think its important for you all to understand the big picture as well,\ McChrystal begins. \Hows the company doing? You guys feeling sorry for yourselves? Anybody? Anybody feel like youre losing?\ McChrystal says. \Sir, some of the guys here, sir, think were losing, sir,\ says Hicks. McChrystal nods. \Strength is leading when you just dont want to lead,\ he tells the men. \Youre leading by example. Thats what we do. Particularly when its really, really hard, and it hurts inside.\ Then he spends 20 minutes talking about counterinsurgency, diagramming his concepts and principles on a whiteboard. He makes COIN seem like common sense, but hes careful not to bullshit the men. \We are knee-deep in the decisive year,\ he tells them. The Taliban, he insists, no longer has the initiative — \but I don't think we do, either.\ Its similar to the talk he gave in Paris, but its not winning any hearts and minds among the soldiers. \This is the philosophical part that works with think tanks,\ McChrystal tries to joke. \But it doesn't get the same reception from infantry companies.\ During the question-and-answer period, the frustration boils over. The soldiers complain about not being allowed to use lethal force, about watching insurgents they detain be freed for lack of evidence. They want to be able to fight — like they did in Iraq, like they had in Afghanistan before McChrystal. We arent putting fear into the Taliban,\ one soldier says. \Winning hearts and minds in COIN is a coldblooded thing,\ McChrystal says, citing an oft-repeated maxim that you can't kill your way out of Afghanistan. \The Russians killed 1 million Afghans, and that didnt work.\ \Im not saying go out and kill everybody, sir,\ the soldier persists. \You say weve stopped the momentum of the insurgency. I dont believe thats true in this area. The more we pull back, the more we restrain ourselves, the stronger its getting.\ \I agree with you,\ McChrystal says. \In this area, weve not made progress, probably. You have to show strength here, you have to use fire. What Im telling you is, fire costs you. What do you want to do? You want to wipe the population out here and resettle it?\ A soldier complains that under the rules, any insurgent who doesn't have a weapon is immediately assumed to be a civilian. \Thats the way this game is,\ McChrystal says. \Its complex. I cant just decide: Its shirts and skins, and well kill all the shirts.\ As the discussion ends, McChrystal seems to sense that he hasnt succeeded at easing the mens anger. He makes one last-ditch effort to reach them, acknowledging the death of Cpl. Ingram. \Theres no way I can make that easier,\ he tells them. \No way I can pretend it wont hurt. No way I can tell you not to feel that. . . . I will tell you, youre doing a great job. Dont let the frustration get to you.\ The session ends with no clapping, and no real resolution. McChrystal may have sold President Obama on counterinsurgency, but many of his own men arent buying it. When it comes to Afghanistan, history is not on McChrystals side. The only foreign invader to have any success here was Genghis Khan — and he wasnt hampered by things like human rights, economic development and press scrutiny. The COIN doctrine, bizarrely, draws inspiration from some of the biggest Western military embarrassments in recent memory: Frances nasty war in Algeria (lost in 1962) and the American misadventure in Vietnam (lost in 1975). McChrystal, like other advocates of COIN, readily acknowledges that counterinsurgency campaigns are inherently messy, expensive and easy to lose. \Even Afghans are confused by Afghanistan,\ he says. But even if he somehow manages to succeed, after years of bloody fighting with Afghan kids who pose no threat to the U.S. homeland, the war will do little to shut down Al Qaeda, which has shifted its operations to Pakistan. Dispatching 150,000 troops to build new schools, roads, mosques and water-treatment facilities around Kandahar is like trying to stop the drug war in Mexico by occupying Arkansas and building Baptist churches in Little Rock. \Its all very cynical, politically,\ says Marc Sageman, a former CIA case officer who has extensive experience in the region. \Afghanistan is not in our vital interest — theres nothing for us there.\ In mid-May, two weeks after visiting the troops in Kandahar, McChrystal travels to the White House for a high-level visit by Hamid Karzai. It is a triumphant moment for the general, one that demonstrates he is very much in command — both in Kabul and in Washington. In the East Room, which is packed with journalists and dignitaries, President Obama sings the praises of Karzai. The two leaders talk about how great their relationship is, about the pain they feel over civilian casualties. They mention the word \progress\ 16 times in under an hour. But there is no mention of victory. Still, the • session represents the most forceful commitment that Obama has made to McChrystals strategy in months. \There is no denying the progress that the Afghan people have made in recent years — in education, in health care and economic development,\ the president says. \As I saw in the lights across Kabul when I landed — lights that would not have been visible just a few years earlier.\ It is a disconcerting observation for Obama to make. During the worst years in Iraq, when the Bush administration had no real progress to point to, officials used to offer up the exact same evidence of success. \It was one of our first impressions,\ one GOP official said in 2006, after landing in Baghdad at the height of the sectarian violence. \So many lights shining brightly.\ So it is to the language of the Iraq War that the Obama administration has turned — talk of progress, of city lights, of metrics like health care and education. Rhetoric that just a few years ago they would have mocked. \They are trying to manipulate perceptions because there is no definition of victory — because victory is not even defined or recognizable,\ says Celeste Ward, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation who served as a political adviser to U.S. commanders in Iraq in 2006. \That's the game we're in right now. What we need, for strategic purposes, is to create the perception that we didn't get run off. The facts on the ground are not great, and are not going to become great in the near future.\ But facts on the ground, as history has proven, offer little deterrent to a military determined to stay the course. Even those closest to McChrystal know that the rising anti-war sentiment at home doesnt begin to reflect how deeply fucked up things are in Afghanistan. \If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular,\ a senior adviser to McChrystal says. Such realism, however, doesnt prevent advocates of counterinsurgency from dreaming big: Instead of beginning to withdraw troops next year, as Obama promised, the military hopes to ramp up its counterinsurgency campaign even further. \There's a possibility we could ask for another surge of U.S. forces next summer if we see success here,\ a senior military official in Kabul tells me. Back in Afghanistan, less than a month after the White House meeting with Karzai and all the talk of \progress,\ McChrystal is hit by the biggest blow to his vision of counterinsurgency. Since last year, the Pentagon had been planning to launch a major military operation this summer in Kandahar, the countrys second-largest city and the Talibans original home base. It was supposed to be a decisive turning point in the war — the primary reason for the troop surge that McChrystal wrested from Obama late last year. But on June 10th, acknowledging that the military still needs to lay more groundwork, the general announced that he is postponing the offensive until the fall. Rather than one big battle, like Fallujah or Ramadi, U.S. troops will implement what McChrystal calls a \rising tide of security.\ The Afghan police and army will enter Kandahar to attempt to seize control of neighborhoods, while the U.S. pours $90 million of aid into the city to win over the civilian population. Even proponents of counterinsurgency are hard-pressed to explain the new plan. \This isn't a classic operation,\ says a U.S. military official. \It's not going to be Black Hawk Down. There aren't going to be doors kicked in.\ Other U.S. officials insist that doors are going to be kicked in, but that its going to be a kinder, gentler offensive than the disaster in Marja. \The Taliban have a jackboot on the city,\ says a military official. \We have to remove them, but we have to do it in a way that doesnt alienate the population.\ When Vice President Biden was briefed on the new plan in the Oval Office, insiders say he was shocked to see how much it mirrored the more gradual plan of counterterrorism that he advocated last fall. \This looks like CT-plus!\ he said, according to U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. Whatever the nature of the new plan, the delay underscores the fundamental flaws of counterinsurgency. After nine years of war, the Taliban simply remains too strongly entrenched for the U.S. military to openly attack. The very people that COIN seeks to win over — the Afghan people — do not want us there. Our supposed ally, President Karzai, used his influence to delay the offensive, and the massive influx of aid championed by McChrystal is likely only to make things worse. \Throwing money at the problem exacerbates the problem,\ says Andrew Wilder, an expert at Tufts University who has studied the effect of aid in southern Afghanistan. \A tsunami of cash fuels corruption, delegitimizes the government and creates an environment where were picking winners and losers\ — a process that fuels resentment and hostility among the civilian population. So far, counterinsurgency has succeeded only in creating a never-ending demand for the primary product supplied by the military: perpetual war. There is a reason that President Obama studiously avoids using the word \victory\ when he talks about Afghanistan. Winning, it would seem, is not really possible. Not even with Stanley McChrystal in charge. This article originally appeared in RS 1108/1109 from July 8-22, 2010.

C05769883	Word is that were going to announce our response to the Israeli flotilla investigation today. Did Jones or Ross speak with you about it?
C05772382	Its worth you checking in with him before the meeting. His quick report of meeting with Allawi: 1. Allawi said he pulled back from striking a deal with ISCI because he is concerned that the Shia representation is too small and there is too much difficulty in trying to widen 2. Allawi asked bill if he thought Maliki was serious, suggesting that he was toying with the idea of a grand coalition 3. Allawi will see Barzani on the 11th Bills overall take is that Allawi might now be looking to test the wider coalition proposition and is not as interested in the ISCI gambit as first option. Bill has also seen AI-Mahdi Talabani and Zebari. He said there would be a good meeting with Maliki hes obviously feeling confident, but was firm on limiting role of Sadrists and need to bring Iraqiyya into inclusive govt.

C05768726	The word from Ramallah is quite positive. IF there are no announcements this week, we anticipate that the Arab League Follow-up Committee will give its blessing on May 1 and Sen Mitchell can return to the region to start talking substance. Given the Israelis warning, this is a real If. Karl/Frank will go in today to walk Karzai through the particulars of the visit - the only thorny part is that it has dropped from 4 to 3 days. But it has all the same elements, plus a dinner with Biden. Did you see reports that Iran has dropped out of the running for the UNSC? Trying to confirm. Andrew S. will be sending you a long memo that responds to DODs pooling proposals - it conveys a desire to work together with DOD on this and offers some alternative ideas. He also canvassed the building on other topics and will send a list up for your book tonight. He and I agreed that the list should just be for reference and that your approach of having informal conversation on the big topics is the right one. You saw CDMs email about the Sudan ad. Ben emailed yesterday to say he wants to talk Sudan comms strategy going forward. Hopefully Ill reach him today. I know CDM is talking to Denis.

C05762423	Thursday, June 18, 2009 Day of Mourning, Protests, Called by Mousavi on Thursday Mir-Hosain Mousavi, who maintains he won last Fridays presidential election despite official assertions that he lost 2 to 1 to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is calling for another rally Thursday, this time in part to honor the persons killed by hardliners or security forces in the course of previous demonstrations. Mourning the martyr is as central to Iranian Shiite religious culture as it was to strains of medieval Catholicism in Europe, and Mousavis camp is tapping into a powerful set of images and myths here. The archetypal Shiite martyr is Imam Husayn, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, who championed oppressed Muslims in Iraq and was cut down by the then Umayyad Muslim Empire. Redognition that a Muslim state might commit the ultimate in sacrilege by beheading a person who had been dangled on the Prophets knee has imbued modern political Shiism with a distrust of the state. When Husayns head was brought to the Umayyad caliph Yazid and deposited before his throne, older companions of the Prophet are said to have wept and remarked, \I saw the Prophets lips on those cheeks.\ Shiites ritually march, flagellate, and chant in honor of the martyred Imam or divinely-appointed leader. Today's protesters are wearing green, which symbolizes Mousavi's descent from the Prophet Muhammad. (Mousavi's family name refers to the Seventh Imam (descendant of the Prophet with claims to divine knowledge), Musa Kazim, whose tomb is in Kazimiya, north Baghdad. Sayyid families, those claiming descent from the Prophet, often take one of the Imams' names as a family name to honor them, though of course they are also claiming descent from the previous Imams right back to the Prophet.) The repertoires of protest the reformists are using echo those of the 1978-79 Islamic Revolution-- they are chanting \God is Great,\ mourning pious fallen martyrs, etc.-- another sign that this movement is not just alienated secularized elites. But now Mousavi's his supporters are also sporting black ribbons to indicate that they are in mourning for the fallen. Typically, the dead will be commemorated again at one month and at 40 days. In 1978 such demonstrations for those killed in previous demonstrations grew in size all through the year, till they reached an alleged million in the streets of Tehran. Since the reformists are already claiming Monday's rally was a million, you wonder where things will go from here. The regime's attempt to paint the protesters as nothing more than US intelligence agents underlines how wise President Obama has been not to insert himself forcefully into the situation in Iran. The reformers and the hard liners are not stable groupings. The core of each is competing for the allegiance of the general Iranian public. If the reformers can convince most Iranians of the justice of their cause, they will swing behind the opposition. If the hard liners can convince the public that the reformers are nothing more than cat's paws of a grasping, imperialist West-- i.e. that they are Ahmad Chalabis trying to bring Iran foreign occupation so as to get power themselves-- then the reformists will be crushed. Iranians value national independence above all, having suffered with a CIA-installed goverment for decades in the mid-twentieth century. The prescriptions of John McCain and Faux Cable news for muscular US diplomacy at this point are tone deaf to Iranian realities and would backfire big time, harming both the reform cause and US interests. Anyway, after the basket case to which the US Republican Party reduced Iraq, no one in the global South is likely to want them meddling in their internal affairs. Reports are streaming in of the arrest of over a hundred opposition figures and of hard line militia men following protesters home and breaking into their homes to terrorize them. See e.g., Basij paramilitary forces terrorize residential complex. The Basij militiamen are said to be afraid to come out in numbers during the opposition demonstrations, but sneak around at night to trail protesters and harass or arrest them. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had met Tuesday morning with the representatives of all four presidential candidates, urging them to make up but continuing to insist that Alunadinejad was the winner by 24 million to 14 million votes. He portrayed the massive post-election demonstrations and charges of ballot fraud as a minor tiff. Gary Sick wonders if Khamenei really is the supreme leader any more, and hints that the hard line tack of stealing the election was directed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the country's religious national guard. Reports are coming in from Iran that allege that the regime is tracking down and destroying satellite dishes, using helicopters for aerial surveillance of neighborhoods and Basij, the right wing militia (sort of like Mussolini's Black Shirts) to do the breaking and entering. Kindly neighbors who have tried to warn suspected satellite dish owners that the militiamen were coming have sometimes reportedly themselves been arrested. Dell Days of Deals!

C05771400	http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/11/the-return-of-ghosts-debating-the-rise-of-geert-wilders-and-the-far-right/ The Return of Ghosts: Debating the rise of Geert Wilders and the far-right at the Nexus Symposium On 11.18.10, By Max The Nexus Institute's Return of Ghosts conference was inspired by the rise of far-right politician Geert Wilders in the Netherlands I spent last week in Amsterdam, where I participated in the \Return of Ghosts\ symposium of the Nexus Institute, a discussion/debate about the resurgence of neo-fascism in Europe and anti-democratic trends in the West. Besides providing a forum for debating European politics, the symposium was the occasion for the first public appearance in Europe by Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa since he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature last month. The arrival of Vargas Llosa, one of the world's foremost intellectuals, resulted in an overflow crowd filled with members of the Dutch media, the country's political class, and the royal family. Even with Vargas Llosa in the spotlight, the participants' attention was focused on Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-right Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, which is now the third leading party in the Netherlands. With his gathering influence, Wilders has essentially placed the Dutch coalition government in a stranglehold; the government meets with him every Wednesday to gauge his opinions and ask for his instructions. While Wilders dictates at will to the government, he remains independent of it, comfortably avoiding the consequences of policies he has helped to shape. It is the perfect position for a politician whose agenda is comprised exclusively of xenophobic populism, and typical strategy of the far-right in countries across the continent. Wilders' base lies in the mostly Catholic south, where ironically few people have ever encountered a Muslim. He has also generated support in the city of Groeningen, once a citadel of the communists. Seeking to expand his base, Wilders promised to hire scores of \animal cops\ to investigate and prosecute the abuse of animals, a clever wedge strategy in the only country I know of that has a party dedicated exclusively to animal rights. Of course, Wilders could care less about our furry friends. His stated goal is to end immigration not just to Holland but to all of Europe; ban the Quran (free speech is only for the \Judeo-Christian\ community), and severely limit the rights of Muslim citizens of Europe by, for instance, instituting what he called a \head rag tax\ on Muslim women. Wilders' international allies include the goosestepping neo- Nazis of the English Defense League, the far-right pogromist Pam Geller, the Belgian neo-fascist party Vlaams Belang, and a substantial portion of the US neocon elite. Over the course of just a few years, he has become perhaps the most influential Islamophobe in the world. But does this make Wilders a fascist? Rob Riemen, the director of the Nexus Institute, thinks so. Riemen has just published a book entitled \De Eeuwige Terugkeer Van Het Fascisme,\ or \The Eternal Return of Fascism\ (I eagerly await its English translation), dedicated to highlighting the danger of Wilders' eerily familiar brand of right-wing populism. In the book, Riemen urges readers to compare Wilders' politics to the early incarnations of European fascism, not to the genocidal terminal stage fascism of late World War II. He calls the parallels between Wilders and the early fascists \one- and-one.\ In an economic and civilizational crisis like the kind the Netherlands is facing, Riemen warns that reactionary figures like Wilders can easily seize power while centrist elements stand by politely and passively, refusing to call a spade a spade. Where Wilders' ascendancy will lead is unknown, but if he is not stopped in his tracks, Riemen is certain the B6 story will not end well. In the week after its publication, Riemen's book flew off the shelves, selling 5000 copies while generating heated reactions from across the spectrum of debate. Riemen told me that despite the public enthusiasm for his book, his characterization of Wilders has been attacked as \un- Dutch.\ In Dutch culture, as in so many others, open confrontation is avoided at all cost. Political disagreement is welcomed only if it is expressed in a collegial manner, as though nothing more than reputations were at stake. So the Dutch cultural elite generally goes along to get along. The resistance Riemen has met since he called Wilders out seemed to have alarmed and frustrated him. Why was it so difficult for liberal elements in the Netherlands to recognize the clear resonances of fascism in Wilders' political style? he wondered. And why did they seem more concerned with regulating the terms of debate than with forming a united front against the far-right? Once the symposium opened and I was able to see the Dutch elite in action, I began to understand Riemen's indignation. The symposium began with a speech by Vargas Llosa, a complex personality who has allied himself with center-right parties in Spain and elsewhere but whose politics remain fundamentally rooted in cultural liberalism. Vargas Llosa's differences with leaders of the left, which he used to belong to, exploded over the issue of free trade. He is an ardent neo- liberal and reviles Latin populists like Hugo Chavez and 011anta Humala who advocate protectionism and industrial nationalization. Vargas Llosa decorated his speech with literary metaphors and natural imagery to describe the challenges of democracy, particularly in Europe. But the body of the address was devoted to the supposed threat Islamic extremism posed to Western civilization. Vargas Llosa singled out suicide bombing as the most dangerous phenomenon, pointing to the Madrid and London bombings by al-Qaida inspired operatives, while curiously not mentioning suicide attacks by secular groups like the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, or the nationalistic suicide terror by Palestinian militants (Vargas Llosa declared in his speech that \Israel deserves to be treated like any other nation,\ and has been harshly critical of the state in the past). During the first panel, which I participated in, Fania Oz-Salzberger, an Israeli professor of history and the daughter of famed author Amos Oz, boasted to crowd of Israel's \vibrant democracy.\ She was enthusiastically seconded by Mitchell Cohen, a former editor of Dissent who has devoted considerable energy to assailing anti-Zionist Jews, writing that \the dominant species of anti-Semitism encourages anti-Zionism.\ I found it odd that neither expressed any concern over the almost endless stream of anti-democratic laws passing through the Knesset, or by the general authoritarian, anti-liberal trend in Israeli society. Oz-Salzberger went on to announce to a smattering of applause that \Geert Wilders and politicians like him are not welcomed by Israelis.\ Yet Wilders is one of Israel's most frequent guests, having visited the country over 40 times in 20 years. In fact, he claims that his views on Islam and Arabs were forged while living on an Israeli moshav. \Nowhere did I have the special feeling of solidarity that I get when I land at Ben Gurion airport,\ he once said. Wilders reportedly receives heavy support from Dutch financial backers of Israel, and has met with a range of Israeli officials. His closest allies lie within the extremist settler movement, prompting him to call for the forced transfer of Palestinians to Jordan. Members of the liberal Zionist intelligensia like Oz-Salzberger may not not want Wilders around, but who in Israel is listening to them? Israel's mainstream leadership echoes Wilders' crudest talking points on a regular basis, while the Zionist left clings to a dwindling handful of Knesset seats and watches passively — even resentfully — as a rag-tag band of leftist radicals fights for equality for all. Consider a recent statement by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who is seen as a centrist within the Israeli political spectrum: \The origin of terrorism is within Islam,\ Olmert declared this month. The pro-Israel position of the new breed of European far-rightists has to be recognized as much more than a convenient political tactic. Of course, saying you \stand with Israel,\ as Wilders so often does, is an easy way to insulate yourself from charges of anti-Semitism. But the extreme right is also attracted to Israel because the country represents its highest ideals. While some critics see Israel as a racist apartheid state, people like Wilders see Israel as a racist apartheid state — and they like it. They richly enjoy when Israel mows down Arab Muslims by the dozens and tells the world to go to hell; they admire Israel's settler culture; and most of all, they yearn to live in a land like Israel that privileges its ethnic majority above all others to the point that it systematically humiliates and dispossesses the swarthy racial outclass. The endgame of the far-right is to make Europe less tolerant and more Israeli. After the Italian philosopher Paolo Flores D'Arcais proclaimed that Italy was no longer a democratic country, citing PM Silvio Berlusconi's control over 90 percent of the country's media, the government's deep seated corruption and the Prime Minister's repeated attempts to impose onerous restrictions on journalistic freedom, Riemen asked me if the United States was a democracy given the the rapidly rising influence of corporations over the media and elections. After two panelists had described Israel as a vibrant democracy while another labeled Italy a non-democratic quasi-dictatorship, I decided that our definition of democracy was subjective at best. So I sidestepped the question and outlined a few of the greatest blows to American democracy, from the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine to the Telecommunications Deregulation Act to the Citizens United SCOTUS decision. Later in the evening, D'Arcais would remark to me with amazement that he never knew American media was ever regulated in the first place. During the 20 minutes or so when students of Tilburg University were able to question the panel, one student asked whether suicide terror was a uniquely Islamic phenomenon, apparently referring to Vargas Llosa's address. I responded that it of course was not, citing the example of secular groups like the Tamil Tigers which brought the tactic into practice the second suicide. I recommended the audience review the research of Robert Pape, the University of Chicago political scientist who demonstrated a clear connection between the American and Israeli occupation of Middle Eastern countries and the motivations of suicide bombers. Oz-Salzberger jumped in, proclaiming that occupation has little or nothing to do with the motives of suicide bombers. She did not marshal any evidence to support her point, possibly because our time was so limited. It would have been hard to do so, however, without supporting the fundamental argument of Wilders about Islam's inherent violence — or the even sillier theory by the Israeli filmmaker/professional hasbarist Pierre Rehov that suicide bombers are motivated by sexual repression. Next, the Dutch panel took the stage. The main attraction was Frits Bolkstein, the longtime leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy who employed Wilders as his parliamentary aide, providing him a stepping stone to his political career. He was a silver haired curmudgeon from aristocratic stock who reminded me instantly of the \paleocon\ characters I've met while covering white nationalist conventions like American Renaissance. \Everything went wrong when the government became impressed in the 90s with the idea of the good stranger,\ Bolkstein declared. \If the previous governments had tightened their immigration laws, there would not have been a Mr. Wilders.\ The only member of the panel to mount a significant challenge to Bolkstein was the Tilburg University professor Paul Frissen, who argued that the rule of law and basic standards of democracy protects \the right to be fundamentalist.\ The other panelists either gave Bolkstein's xenophobia a pass or attempted to surpass his resentment of Muslims. After Bolkstein lightly criticized Wilders' call for banning the Quran, remarking that \what he says about Islam is nonsense\ because it contradicts the freedom of religion, AB Klink, a former Dutch senator and ex-Minister of Health, chimed in.\Its not nonsense because Islam is so different in its cultural values than ours,\ Klink claimed. Then, when Bolkstein called for shutting down Islamic schools, Frissen reminded him that state-supported Christian schools in the Dutch Bible belt teach theocratic concepts as well. Meindert Fennema, the political biographer of Wilders, entered the debate to demand that all religious schools be closed. \Im against all forms of religious teaching!\ he proudly exclaimed, sending gales of applause through the audience. \How can you call yourself a liberal?\ Frissen asked with a tone of exasperation. Fennema ignored him. During question time, a young freelance writer from India named Natasha Ginwala asked Bolkstein to answer for the \ghost of neo-colonialism,\ which \the African people never voted for.\ She mentioned the exploitative deals forced on developing countries by transnational oil companies, possibly alluding to Bolkstein's role as a manager at Royal Dutch Shell in authoritarian countries like El Salvador, Indonesia, and Honduras during the 1970's (I'm sure nothing unseemly happened during Bo!stein's tenure in these places). Bolkstein's responded bluntly, \If these countries try to be self- sufficient it just doesnt work!\ After the symposium, I talked to Ginwala and a group of her friends, who were mostly immigrant students. They were appalled by the ignorance of the Dutch panelists. \None of them knew the first thing about Islam,\ an Arab student remarked. \They couldnt even pretend to understand what Muslims actually believe.\ Ginwala added, \How can Bolkstein tell me my country cant be self-sufficient? I come from India. Its one of the most diversified economies on the planet.\ I was not in Amsterdam long enough to do any formal reporting. However, I did notice that all of the immigrants I spoke to were closely and nervously following the rise of the right. At the airport, while waiting to board my flight, I talked to a 20- something security guard named Muhammad who seemed almost as bored as I was. Muhammad had spent his whole life in Amsterdam, but his parents were from Cairo, Egypt. He told me he wanted to take his girlfriend on a trip to New York City and Miami someday. When I brought up the topic of Wilders, he scoffed at his perception of Muslims. \Most of us arent even religious,\ Muhammad said. \When I hear him talking about Muslims wanting to take over, I just laugh. Im like, is this guy serious?\ But he did not underestimate Wilders' appeal. \Everything he does and everything he says, it seems like its carefully planned. He obviously knows what hes doing. And they let him get away with it,\ Muhammad remarked. \Look, Im just a citizen, Im nobody, but if I say something about Christians or Jews that the government doesnt like, Ill be punished. But when Wilders, who is a public official, says all the things he says about Muslims, nothing happens to him. Instead, more and more people are voting for him.

Speculation about Emanuels departure has been a favorite parlor game for nearly a year — stoked by Emanuels admission that hed love to run for Chicago mayor (should current Mayor Richard Daley retire, of course), his own kvetching about the rigors of the job, withering attacks on him from the left and the right and the fact that the average expiration date on a chief of staff is 18 months. Emanuel is leaving, but his departure date has proved to be profoundly elastic. Friends and co-workers said he vacillates from day to day, sometimes minute to minute. He might leave in December after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending on whether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said. And even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots in D.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School in Washington through the 2011 school year, according to a person close to Emanuel. Hes shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller — bombarding White House staffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as he traveled in Israel for his sons bar mitzvah. And in a broader sense, its hard to imagine Emanuels huge personality extracted from the political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obamas Washington. Take the last game of last weeks NBA Finals, when any American voter could wander into Tunnicliffs Tavern on Capitol Hill and witness one of the most powerful men in the nation egging on the Boston Celtics — screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually — joined by a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.); Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); and a pair of favorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post. Despite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obamas \idealism\ and is racing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman still loves the attention and power of his current job and hasnt made up his mind when hes leaving, people who know him said. \This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless,\ Emanuel said in a statement pushing back against a story in the U.K.s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless! and fed up. Replacing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and the small clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett. For one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post-November political landscape looks like before picking a successor: If Republicans take back one or more house of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executive power against a hostile Hill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuels successor will need some of his legislative skills. Barring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isnt likely to reach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said. Still, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quite likely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currenW head of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a major liberal think tank with close ties to the administration. Rouse, a senior adviser who served as Obamas Senate chief of staff, is considered the best pure manager in the White House and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, according to a half-dozen.administration officials and consultants. But Rouses colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Dead and his cats — but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unless Obama insisted. \The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, very comfortable with him in charge,\ said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well. \But he probably won't take it.\ One possible candidate — deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuels political go-to guy — is likely to play a major role in Obamas 2012 reelection campaign and is expected to move to Chicago sometime next year. In Messinas absence, another Emanuel favorite — Deputy National Security Adviser Tom Donilon — has emerged as a possible successor, according to people close to the situation. Obama has been impressed by Donilons presentations at the Presidents Daily Briefing, and the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience, serving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department spokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obama prepare for debates against John McCain. One major Donilon drawback: He served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae, the bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatory oversight. David Plouffe, Obamas 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputation for discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant to settle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is also a possible successor, even though his nomination for Health and Human Services secretary was scuttled by revelations he failed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client. Another White House aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obamas for his legislative savvy and political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experience that other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the Hill wont mean much if Democrats surrender their majorities in either house. Then theres Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Bidens brainy and politically astute chief of staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Klain — who also served as Al Gores chief of staff — is well-regarded inside the White House. Plus, hes got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the HBO movie \Recount,\ about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount. Klains downside: Hes essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapport with the president, according to insiders. C 2010 Capitol News Company, LLC

C05766239	Sorry -- meant to send earlier: China sees no chance of climate deal - source Thu Dec 17, 2009 Print I Single Page By Krittivas Mukherjee and Pete Harrison COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - China has told participants in the U.N. climate change talks that it sees no possibility of achieving an operational accord this week, an official involved in the Copenhagen talks said on Thursday. Dozens of heads of state are descending on the Danish capital to address the December 7-18 conference, and had hoped to sign on Friday a new pact to tackle global warming. The official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the Chinese had instead suggested issuing \a short political declaration of some sort,\ but it was not clear what that would say. The official said negotiations were continuing to try to reach a breakthrough that would still allow an operational agreement to be signed. The official said the sticking point for China appeared to be a process issue. U.S. President Barack Obama has called for an \operational accord\ -- essentially a political agreement with teeth that can get countries working to cut or curb their greenhouse gas emissions while a more formal and binding treaty is hammered out in 2010. Some ministers warned that slow, often stalled talks during the summit meant it was staring at failure. \We may not get there on the substance, it is quite possible well fail on the substance, but at least lets give it a try,\ said Britain's energy and climate minister Ed Miliband. \At the moment the problem is were not giving it a try.\ Developed and developing nations are at odds over who should cut emissions, how deep the cuts should be, and how much funding should be provided to poor countries to help them shift to greener growth and adapt to a warmer world. While the overall picture is bleak, there has been some progress in areas critical to reaching a deal. Africa dramatically scaled back its expectations for climate aid from rich nations, and Japan pledged about $11 billion (6.8 billion pound) in public funds to 2012 to help poor countries adapt to a warmer world and cut their emissions. Talks on a U.N.-backed system to pay poorer nations to curb deforestation have advanced, and the United States pledged $1 billion in short-term funds to conserve tropical forests. A major sticking point between the worlds top emitters, the United States and China, has been the question of how they will prove they are sticking to emission-curbing plans. On Tuesday, Chinas climate change ambassador warned developed countries against using climate change as an excuse to set up trade barriers. Yu Qingtai said rich nations should not think that slapping carbon tariffs on imports from countries with different emissions control regimes would substitute for reaching a global deal to tackle warming.

C05766486	Photo is gorgeous (and there are 20 more online, some are really great) The article is good, just way too short, so it became very matter of fact, didnt include a lot of the great stuff he saw that day. They cut what he turned in in half. But for this readership, that length is probably perfect. It supposedly gets seen by 70 million people. 69 million probably never open it up and just see it in their Sunday paper, so the cover is the ballgame. Story is basically an excuse for the cover. And the cover is a homerun. In the end, I firmly believe it will be the totality all these in-depth projects like Vogue, National Geographic, Nightline, Time - which I know are annoying - that are going to create a collage documenting your success, especially in terms of style and work ethic, which I believe is what people are most interested when it comes to their perception and approval of you.

C05766606	Heres the update, pieced together from various sources: Starting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene Foster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion continued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Fosters presence is apparently very helpful. Her relationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.) Woodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks are. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push on today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to wind up today and resume on Monday. Brown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon. The issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within the DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too much. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also moved. The DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinsons goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal Dodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework requires consultation, legislation, and implementation. The role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish language act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.
C05766631	Of course. I will not forward any of your emails and I appreciate your sending notes on issues you want to make sure we are tracking!

Bottom line — we are actively working a number of the options, including the British option. 3. Saw Kurt this evening to discuss a potential Asia speech in Hawaii and he was focused on Jim again. I know you spoke with him and assume he gave you the same analysis. 4. Sent you updates on Libya — it played as we expected...a demand for a complete settlement freeze including •Jerusalem. Our press line will be to gloss over that and focus on the top line: We have Arab support for efforts to create conditions to continue the negotiations .... i.e., no collapse. You will receive tomorrow morning two Plan B documents, one from the Mitchell team and one from Dennis Ross. Will continue to report this weekend.

Its the kind of typical collective dissection we have now come to expect but that never really existed before: serious, speculative, arcane, funny, brilliant, baked, etc. The Sunliaht Foundation b!000inci is predictably good. Paul Blumenthal dips into the multinational dimension of the new \corporation as full citizen-person\ framework, drawing on blogging going on at Neytsweqk and the CerAer for Pubiic inter. \Looks like [the Court] might support allowing foreign companies to spend freely in elections in the United States. I guess this would be the corporate globalization of the U.S. electoral system.\ So you gotta ask yourself: Who does Hugo Chavez want for President? Blumenthal excerpting the Center for Public Integrity: The Center for Public Integrity looks at this closer and shows what kind of foreign influence we are looking at: One prominent examples is CITGO Petroleum Company — once the American-born Cities Services Company, but purchased in 1990 by the Venezuelan government-owned Petroieos de Venezuela S.A. The Citizens United ruling could conceivably allow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who has sharply criticized both of the past two U.S. presidents, to spend government funds to defeat an American political candidate, just by having CITGO buy TV ads bashing his target. And its not just Chavez. The Saudi government owns Houstons Saudi Refining Company and half of Motive Enterprises. Lenovo, which bought IBMs PC assets in 2004, is partially owned by the Chinese governments Chinese Academy of Sciences. And Singapores APL Limited operates several U.S. port operations. A weakening of the limit on corporate giving could mean China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and any other country that owns companies that operate in the U.S. could also have significant sway in American electioneering. I really cant see Americans being too happy about this. ha Lithwick reported :rC( .ate from the Supreme Court as the opinions were being read. She offered this aside: While Stevens is reading the portion of his concurrence about the \cautious view of corporate power\ held by the framers, I see Justice Thomas chuckle softly. Was it a disdainful chuckle at the impotence of his colleague? Was it merely a chuckle of disagreement, of good-natured exasperation? Was it a chuckle at an anachronistic vision of the framers set beside todays modern corporate silicon and steel behemoths? I doubt he was thinking about Hugo Chavez.

C05772864	I know Im not supposed to lift my head from the QDDR, but just thought you would like to see this — its for all the ideas you wanted promoted when you picked me. AM The Crossroads Nation By DAVID BROOKS Bill Clinton used to talk about building a bridge to the 21st century. President Obama talks about laying down a \new foundation.\ But Clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like, and Obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation. They are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country America is going to be in 2030 or 2050. Nobody has quite defined Americas coming economic identity. In thinking about this question, it probably helps to start at the beginning. Five hundred years ago, agriculture was the major economic activity. One hundred years ago, it was industrial production. Now, of course, were living in an information age. Innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth. Howard Gardner of Harvard once put together a composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person: She comes from a little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence. As an adolescent, she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle. She moves to a metropolis and finds a group of people who share her passions and interests. She gets involved with a team to create something amazing. Then, at some point, she finds her own problem, which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her group. She breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing. She brings it back to her circle. It is tested, refined and improved. The main point in this composite story is that creativity is not a solitary process. It happens within networks. It happens when talented people get together, when idea systems and mentalities merge. Now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010, 2025 or 2050. You are living in some small town in Ukraine or Kenya or some other place, foreign or domestic. You long to break out and go to a place where people are gathering to think about the things you are thinking about, creating the things you want to create. If you are passionate about fashion, maybe you will go to Paris. If its engineering, maybe itll be Germany. But if you are passionate about many other spheres, I suspect youll want to be in America. Youll want to be in the U.S. because English has become the global language. Youll want to come because American universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth. Youll want to be there because American institutions are relatively free from corruption. Intellectual property is protected. Huge venture capital funds already exist. Moreover, the United States is a universal nation. There are already people there with connections all over the world. A nation of immigrants is more permeable than say, Chinese society. You also observe that America hosts the right kind of networks — ones that are flexible and intense. Study after study suggests that America is one of those societies with high social trust. Americans build large, efficient organizations that are not bound by the circles of kinship and clan. Study after study finds that Americans are not hierarchical. American children are raised to challenge their parents. American underlings are relatively free to challenge their bosses. In this country youre less likely to have to submit to authority. From this story you can see that economic power in the 21st century is not going to look like economic power in the 20th century. The crucial fact about the new epoch is that creativity needs hubs. Information networks need junction points. The nation that can make itself the crossroads to the world will have tremendous economic and political power. In 2009, Anne-Marie Slaughter, now director of policy planning at the State Department, wrote an essay for Foreign Affairs in which she laid out the logic of this new situation: \In a networked world, the issue is no longer relative power, but centrality in an increasingly dense global web.\ Slaughters essay was titled \Americas Edge.\ That is apt. Americans are now in a depressed state of mind. As China and India rise, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe their nation is in decline. In fact, the U.S. is well situated to be the crossroads nation. It is well situated to be the center of global networks and to nurture the right kinds of networks. Building that America means doing everything possible to thicken connections: finance research to attract scientists; improve infrastructure to ease travel; fix immigration to funnel talent; reform taxes to attract superstars; make study abroad a rite of passage for college students; take advantage of the millions of veterans who have served overseas. The nation with the thickest and most expansive networks will define the age. There's no reason to be pessimistic about that.

C05739841	The Washington Post December 4, 2012 Tuesday Regional Edition SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A25 HEADLINE: It's not about Rice BYLINE: Richard Cohen BODY: In 1953, an Army officer by the name of Irving Peress was promoted from captain to major. Peress was a leftist, possibly a communist, and word of his advancement in rank reached Sen. Joseph McCarthy in Washington. He asserted that the promotion proved the Army was \soft on communism,\ and he launched an investigation that transfixed the nation. Peress, by the way, was a mere dentist. He was the Susan Rice of his day. Rice, of course, is a much more substantial figure. She is the U.N. ambassador, a friend of Barack Obama's and a member of his Cabinet. Still, the attack on her is so disproportionate to what she is accused of having done - just what was it, exactly? - that as in the Peress case, you have to conclude that there is something more at work. At first, I thought we were witnessing just another example of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) doing his Rumpelstiltskin number - throwing a fit and stomping his feet. It was McCain who first leveled the solemn charge that Rice had lied to the Sunday TV shows about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. She had characterized it as a spontaneous riot when it was, in fact, a planned attack by a local al-Qaeda affiliate. But Rice was hewing to the early line established by the intelligence community. If the CIA and others were wrong - or deceptive - then so, inevitably, was she. Just as surely as day follows night, McCain's broadside was echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). It was soon taken up by 97 Republicans in the House who found Rice unqualified to become secretary of state - a post to which she has not been nominated. \Ambassador Rice is widely viewed as having willfully or incompetently misled the American public,\ they bellowed. I think Rice would make a dandy secretary of state. She's close to the president, and that matters a great deal. But she is also seen as overly political and that, as much as her version of Benghazi, is what troubles some others. Oddly enough, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a former presidential candidate and another potential secretary of state, is seen as much more of a statesmen. He is indeed an independent foreign-policy thinker who has, as in days of old, restored the prestige and importance of the Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is chairman. But the awful truth is that it hardly matters who Obama chooses. Foreign policy is run from the White House and not the State Department. Hillary Clinton is about to retire, and while she has done a commendable U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739841 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. job at Foggy Bottom, we cannot expect the inevitable book by her to reveal a Clinton Doctrine. For the most part, she executed, not initiated, foreign policy. So what is this fuss all about? Not Rice, that's for sure. It has turned instead into an expression of unease about Obarna's foreign policy and its politicization. The unfortunate Peress came to personify the government's alleged indifference to the (equally alleged) communist infiltration of the military and virtually everything else (with the possible exception of the American Legion), Similarly, Rice has become the personification of unhappiness with the use of intelligence leaks to buff Obanaa's foreign policy image and the conducting of an amorphous foreign policy. Like Churchill's famous pudding, it lacks theme. Syria is an example. U.S. inaction has allowed the crisis to fester. Bashar al-Assad's regime might be dusting off its formidable arsenal of chemical weapons, further evidence of how chaotic this crisis has become, but much of the time the White House has just trailed after Turkey or France. The war has spread, a refugee calamity has developed, 40,000 people have died, and jihadists have come to play a prominent role. The Obarna administration has been as lethargic on Syria as it initially was with Libya. This sense of an aimless foreign policy, one lacking any moral fervor (or fiber) irritates conservatives much more than liberals. It certainly enrages McCain, who cannot stomach the big guys kicking little guys around. He sees an administration that will not engage the American people on matters of foreign policy - make a case for intervention, not just say it's too hard to do. The attack on Rice is unfair and excessive. But the issue is not the person but what she represents - in this case, the administration's 'mobility to articulate a foreign policy that marries American morality to American power, not merely American politics.

Romania agrees to sign an agreement in regards to the existent border regime, the way it was inherited from the USSR.\ Romania and Moldova, in fact, have good relations and no real border issues; the two governments are working on an agreement to make cross-border travel easier for Moldovans. The biggest challenge to Moldova's territorial integrity is Transnistria, where de facto authorities rely on the long-term presence of Russian forces for political support. Moldova's leaders seek a transition to a multilateral presence and withdrawal of Russian troops, but this is not likely without a political settlement on Transnistria's reintegration. Moldovan and Transnistrian authorities are pursuing quiet confidence building measures and (Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Transnistria and the OSCE are the 5 parties and the US and EU are the 2 observers), but — Reason: 1.4(B), 1.4(D) — Declassify on: 02/09/2030

Note last sentence about action by \US Authorities\, Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs 09-September-2010 11:44 1ST Home Minister Appeals to Media to Help Maintain Communal Harmony in View of U.S. Pastor Threatening to Burn Quran The Union Home Minister Slui P.Chidambaram has appealed to media to help maintain communal peace and harmony in the wake of reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the holy Quran. In a statement issued here today, the Union Home Minister said that the act is calculated to increase strife between different religious groups. Following is the text of his statement : \There are reports of a pastor in the United States threatening to burn the Quran on September 11, 2010. The US authorities have strongly condemned the statement of the pastor. Religious leaders all over the world have also condemned his proposed action. We condemn the action of the pastor. It is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion. It is obviously calculated to increase bitterness and strife between different religious groups. No one who is interested in maintaining harmony and peace among different sections of the people can condone such action. We hope that the US authorities will take strong action to prevent such an outrage being committed. While we await the action of the US authorities, we would appeal to the media in India — both print and visual media — to refrain from telecasting visuals or publishing photographs of the deplorable act. We would also appeal to the media to exercise great restraint over the next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony.\ OK/KS India Condemns U.S. Pastor's Plan to Burn the Quran, Urges Media Restraint By Bibhudatta Pradhan - Sep 9, 2010 India \condemns\ a plan by a Florida pastor to burn copies of the Koran and the government hopes the U.S. will take strong action against him, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said in New Delhi. Terry Jones, pastor of the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville has been criticized by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Vatican for his plan to burn the Muslim holy book on Sept. 11. General David Petraeus, commander of international coalition forces in Afghanistan, said the act would endanger U.S. troops. Chidambaram urged Indian newspapers not to publish photographs of what he said would be a \deplorable act\ and asked television channels to refrain from broadcasting images. The media must show restraint over the \next couple of days and help in maintaining communal peace and harmony,\ the minister said, reading a government statement. The proposed burning \is totally unbecoming of anyone who claims to be a man of religion,\ Chidambaram said. About 13 percent of India's 1.2 billion people are Muslim. Facing mounting criticism around the world and at home, Jones said yesterday that supporters have sent him copies of the Koran to burn and he was not convinced \that backing down is the right thing to do,\ Associated Press reported.

Aides to U.S. general in Afghanistan slam Obama: report 20 mins ago WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Aides to the top U.S. general in Afghanistan insulted some of President Barack Obama's closest advisers, calling one a \clown\ and another a \wounded animal,\ in an article to be published Friday in Rolling Stone magazine. The article also quotes an aide describing the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal's \disappointment\ with his initial one-on-one meeting with Obama last year. Quoting all the McChrystal aides anonymously, the article portrays a split between the U.S. military and Obama's advisers at an extremely sensitive moment for the Pentagon, which is fending off criticism of its strategy to turn around the nearly nine-year-old Afghan war. The Pentagon had no immediate comment about the article, which has been brought to the attention of senior officials. It quotes a member of McChrystal's team making jokes about Vice President Joe Biden, who was seen as critical of the general's efforts to escalate the conflict and who had favored a more limited counter-terrorism approach. \Biden?\ the aide was quoted as saying. \Did you say: Bite me?\ Another aide called White House National Security Adviser Jim Jones, a retired four star general, a \clown\ who was \stuck in 1985.\ It quoted an adviser to McChrystal dismissing an early meeting with Obama as a \10-minute photo op.\ \Obama clearly didnt know anything about him, who he was. The boss was pretty disappointed,\ the adviser told the magazine. McChrystal, a famous workaholic said to sleep just four hours a day, was brought into Afghanistan a year ago after his predecessor was pushed out. The article portrays his teams as disapproving of the Obama administration, with the exception of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who backed McCrystals request for additional troops in Afghanistan. Some of the strongest criticism was reserved for Richard Holbrooke, Obamas special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan. \The boss says hes like a wounded animal,\ a member of the general's team is quoted as saying. \Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that hes going to get fired, so that makes him dangerous.\ McChrystal was quoted as saying he felt \betrayed\ by the leak of a classified cable from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry last year. The cable raised doubts about sending more troops to shore up an Afghan government already lacking in credibility. \I like Karl, Ive known him for years, but theyd never said anything like that to us before,\ McChrystal was quoted as saying in the article. \Heres one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, I told you so.\ (Editing by Washington World Desk) Copyright © 2010 Yahoo! Inc. All rights reserved. And from the WSJ: 0 JUNE 21, 2010, 6:55 PM ET McChrystals Next Offensive? Relations between the U.S. military and civilians in the Obama administration have been tense since last years three-month review of Afghan war strategy, a state of affairs unlikely to be helped by a new profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the overall commander in Afghanistan, that will appear in Rolling Stone magazine on Friday. In the eight-page article, released to reporters on Monday ahead of publication, McChrystal appears to belittle Vice President Joe Biden and accuses Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador to Kabul, of undermining his war plan within the administration. Asked by the Rolling Stone reporter about what he now feels of the war strategy advocated by Biden last fall — fewer troops, more drone attacks — the article reports that McChrystal and his aides attempted to come up with a good one-liner to dismiss the question. \Are you asking about Vice President Biden?\ McChrystal reportedly jokes. \Whos that?\ Later in the article, McChrystal turns more serious when asked about cables sent last fall to Washington by Eikenberry. The cables called into question the major troop increase advocated by McChrystal's team and the U.S.'s backing of Afghan President Hamid Karzai — views that the ambassador had not previously raised with McChrystal or his staff. \I like Karl, Ive known him for years, but theyd never said anything like that to us before,\ McChrystal is quoted as saying. \Heres one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, I told you so.\ The article, titled \The Runaway General,\ has already caused nervousness inside the Pentagon, where memories are still fresh of another blistering profile that got a top commander in hot water: an August 2008 cover story in Esquire <hop://wvav.esquire.com/features/fox-fallon > on Adm. William \Fox\ Fallon, then commander of all U.S. forces in the Middle East and Central Asia. The article eventually played a part in Fallon's resignation two years ago. In that Esquire piece, however, Fallon appeared to directly contradict White House policy on Iran and other parts of the Middle East; the Rolling Stone article makes no such allegation, but rather is full of jokey put-downs of important Washington players. Comments in the article attributed to anonymous McChrystal aides are particularly harsh towards some senior members of the Obama administration, including National Security Adviser James Jones, and other leading politicians, like Sens. John Kerry (D., Mass.) and John McCain (R., Ariz). They also make some unflattering references to PresidentBarack Obama himself, saying the president didn't seem to know who McChrystal was when he appointed him to run the war early last year. Only Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is portrayed as having strongly backed McChrystal's plan for Afghanistan, is singled out for praise by the anonymous McChrystal aides. A spokesman for McChrystal did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday. Copyright 2008 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tensions between General Stanley McChrystal and the White House are on full display in an unflattering profile in Rolling Stone of the commander of US and NATO forces in the Afghan war. McChrystal jokes sarcastically about preparing to answer a question referring to Vice President Joe Biden, known as a skeptic of the commander's war strategy. \Are you asking about Vice President Biden? McChrystal says with a laugh. Whos that?\ the article quotes him as saying. \Biden? suggests a top adviser. Did you say: Bite Me?\ McChrystal tells the magazine that he felt \betrayed\ by the US ambassador to Kabul, Karl Eikenberry, in a White House debate over war strategy last year. Referring to a leaked internal memo from Eikenberry that questioned McChrystal's request for more troops, the commander suggested the ambassador had tried to protect himself for history's sake. \I like Karl, Ive known him for years, but theyd never said anything like that to us before,\ McChrystal tells the magazine. \Heres one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, ?I told you so.\ Eikenberry, himself a former commander in Afghanisan, had written to the White House saying Afghan President Hamid Karzai was an unreliable partner and that a surge of troops could draw the United States into a open-ended quagmire. The article revisits the friction between the White House and the military last fall as Obama debated whether to grant McChrystals request for tens of thousands of reinforcements. Although Obama in the end granted most of what McChrystal asked for, the strategy review was a difficult time, the general tells the magazine. \I found that time painful,\ McChrystal says. \I was selling an unsellable position.\ An unnamed adviser to McChrystal alleges the general came away unimpressed after a meeting with Obama in the Oval Office a year ago, just after the president named him to take over in Afghanistan. \It was a 10-minute photo op,\ the generals adviser says. \Obama clearly didn?t know anything about him, who he was.., he didn?t seem very engaged. \The boss was pretty disappointed,\ says the adviser. The profile, titled \The Runaway General,\ portrays his aides as profane and intensely loyal to McChrystal, while arguing the general has seized control over the war on the military and diplomatic fronts. The four-star general also derides the hard-charging top US envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, and complains about a dinner with an unnamed French minister during a visit to Paris. \Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,\ McChrystal says, looking at his messages on a mobile phone. \I dont even want to open it.\ In a hotel room in Paris getting ready for a dinner with a French official, McChrystal says: \Howd I get screwed into going to this dinner?\ \The dinner comes with the position, sir,\ says his aide, Colonel Charlie Flynn. \Hey, Charlie,\ McChrystal says, \does this come with the position?\ McChrystal gives him the middle finger.

Photograph: Peter Muhly/AFP/Getty Images The final part of the Northern Ireland devolution deal was put in place today, giving the province its first justice minister since the Troubles erupted four decades ago. Nationalists and unionists in the Stormont parliament voted together to create the new justice ministry, completing the last act of the Good Friday agreement. But there was discord inside the Stormont parliament after the Conservatives allies in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionists, and their 18-strong assembly team, voted against the move. Despite an 11th hour intervention by David Cameron imploring the UUP to vote yes, the party refused to back the historic measure. The partys stance puts Cameron in a difficult position: he is in favour of the devolution of justice to Belfast, but his electoral pact with the UUP risks exposing him to criticism that a Conservative government could not claim to be an \honest broker\ when there are disagreements between the parties at Stormont. Todays vote came just before 5pm, when 88 assembly members from Sinn Fein and the DUP joined the SDLP and smaller parties to back the transfer of policing and judicial powers to Belfast. But the UUP resisted pressure — from, among others, former US president George Bush — to support the measure. Speaking on the assembly floor, Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader, said his party had voted no \as a democratic political to a friend hare end IL i r• ontact us er I smaller party pledged to making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern Ireland, and we exercise our rights refusing to bow to the blackmail and bullying to which we have been subjected in recent weeks.\ The deputy first minister, Sinn Feins Martin McGuinness, earlier denounced the UUP stance, claiming it was intended to embarrass the DUP. \The UUP declared last night that they will not support this resolution,\ McGuinness told the assembly. \That saddens and disappoints me. They are opposed in my view to the transfer for cynical party political reasons.\ In a statement after the vote, Gordon Brown praised the parties which backed the deal. \Today the politics of progress have finally replaced the politics of division in Northern Ireland,\ the prime minister said. \The completion of devolution, supported by all sections of the community in Northern Ireland, is the final end to decades of strife. It sends the most powerful message to those who would return to violence: that democracy and tolerance will prevail. \The courage and leadership of the parties who voted to complete devolution at Stormont will be noted around the world.\ The Conservatives welcomed the vote, without mentioning the UUP's rejection of the move. A Tory spokesman said: \We welcome the fact that devolution of policing and justice is going to happen. We wanted all four parties to be involved and for it to be decided by local politicians.\ But the Liberal Democrats called on Cameron to \clarify the position of his Tory-UUP alliance on the devolution of policing and justice powers\. Alistair Carmichael, their spokesman on Northern Ireland, said: \With the UUP saying one thing, and the Tories saying the complete opposite, voters will struggle to understand what exactly joint Tory-UUP candidates stand for. What were seeing is the Tories in complete disarray. When it takes George Bush to step in as the voice of reason, its clear that David Cameron has dug himself a very big hole.\ Carmichael added: \This raises serious questions about David Camerons judgment. If he cant manage to steer a straight course in opposition, how on earth would he cope as prime minister?\ Earlier there was acrimony in the Great Hall at Stormont when a victims' campaigner attempted to serve a civil writ against McGuinness. Willie Frazer of the group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives threw the legal document in McGuinness's direction after the deputy first minister refused to take it off him. Frazer is taking a civil action in Belfast high court against the Sinn Fein MP because he alleges McGuinness directed the IRA's campaign during the Troubles. The south Armagh unionist's father was shot dead by the IRA. The FAIR spokesman said he had chosen yesterday because the DUP \had betrayed me and other victims\ by agreeing to devolve policing and justice powers. Frazer predicted that Sinn Fein would exercise a major influence over the police and judiciary even though the centrist, non-sectarian Alliance party leader, David Ford, will be the first justice minister. Frazer said: \I am very disappointed in the DUP because for years they said the things victims wanted to hear and now they have done a complete somersault. All along they told me that Sinn Fein would never get their hands on policing and justice but they have a say. Mr Ford is answerable to the executive and that means the deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness. That is why the only action left to me is a civil action. I feel very let down by a number of DUP people.\ The DUP will suffer at the polls for this U-turn, Frazer predicted. rintable version Email Close Recipient's email address Your first name Your surname Add a note (optional) [Send] Your IP address will be logged Share Close • Digq • reddit • Google Bookmarks • Twitter • delicious • StumbleUpon • Newsvine • livejournal • Facebook • Mixx it!

C05763920	I will actually meet you at your house, I have the answers to most of your questions from last night And will include the 5 points
C05767454	FYI -- Reid: Shelby Has Hold On All Nominees Friday, Feb. 5, 2010 Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has placed a blanket hold on all executive nominations on the Senate calendar in an effort to win concessions from the Obama administration and Pentagon on a variety of fronts affecting his home state, according to aides to Senate Majority Leader Reid. Reid spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle said Shelby is blocking more than 70 pending nominations. Reid can force a vote on any nomination by filing cloture. Because of the time required to vote on multiple nominations, the Senate processes most nominations by unanimous consent. Any one senator can block any of those nominations by objecting to a unanimous consent request to take it up. The nominations will remain stalled unless Reid files cloture. While holds are frequent, Senate aides said a blanket hold represents a far more aggressive use of the power than is normal. \He should not be holding up 70-plus nominees for a parochial issue,\ a Democratic aide said. \They're qualified and they should be moving forward.\ Disclosure of the blanket hold came after two days in which top Democrats voiced mounting frustration with Republican holds on executive nominees. Weve got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously viewed as well qualified -- nobody has a specific objection to them -- but end up having a hold on them because of some completely unrelated piece of business,\ President Obama said Wednesday in a televised meeting with Senate Democrats. On the Senate floor Thursday, Reid, Senate Majority Whip Durbin, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ripped Republicans for holds on national security nominees and judges. Reid, who kept the Senate in pro forma session over recent holidays to prevent former President George W. Bush from making recess appointments, said he has grown so frustrated he might advocate such appointments, which the president can make when the Senate is out of session. 'What alternatives do we have?\ Reid said on the floor Thursday. \What alternative do we have?\ Earlier in the day, a spokesman for Shelby said the senator has placed holds on \several pending nominees due to unaddressed national security concerns,\ including frustrations with the Air Forces handling of the competition for an aerial refueling tanker. The spokesman did not respond to later requests for comment about the blanket hold. Northrop Grumman Corp. and EADS, the European consortium behind Airbus, and Boeing Co. are vying for the high- stakes contract, potentially worth $40 billion. The Northrop/EADS team would build the planes in Mobile, Ala., but has threatened to pull out of the competition unless the Air Force makes changes to a draft request for proposals. \Nearly 10 years after the U.S. Air Force announced plans to replace the aging tanker fleet, we still do not have a transparent and fair acquisition process to move forward,\ the spokesman said. \The Department of Defense must recognize that the draft request for proposal needs to be significantly and substantively changed.\ Defense Secretary Gates Wednesday told House lawmakers the Pentagon plans to issue the final request for proposals soon, and will proceed with the program whether or not there is a competition. \Obviously we would like to have a competition for it, and we hope that both companies will agree to participate, but we will move forward,\ Gates said. \We have to have new tankers.\ In addition to the tanker issue, Shelbys spokesman said he is frustrated that the Obama administration wont build an Alabama-based FBI center to analyze improvised explosive devices. Shelby secured a $45 million earmark in the FY08 omnibus appropriations bill for a Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center to be set up at the Armys Redstone Arsenal. \Sen. Shelby will continue to work with the FBI to give them the capability to coordinate intelligence as well as forensic and technical exploitation related to IEDs, but this administration's coddling of terrorists makes this an uphill effort,\ the spokesman said. \He has made the administration aware of these concerns and is willing to discuss them at any time.\ Also Thursday, Vice President Biden said he was so frustrated by Republican foot-dragging that he was considering whether Senate rules should be changed. \There's a little disappointment in that it seems like the only way to do business up here anymore is with a supermajority on almost everything,\ Biden said moments after swearing in Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., who gives Republicans 41 votes, enough to filibuster on any issue. What I have been doing is spending a lot of time having my staff go back and scrub this, you know, the use of the filibuster and how its worked,\ Biden said. \This is not a constitutional requirement.\ Biden defended the 60-vote requirement, calling it \a useful tool. Its legitimate, but from my perspective having served here, having been elected seven times, Ive never seen a time when its become sort of standard operating procedure. ... Requiring a supermajority is just not a good way to do business.\ by Dan Friedman and Megan Scully

C05765604	November 09, 2009 Samuel J. Heyman, who stood out as a corporate raider who preferred to hold on to companies he bought and run them rather that sell them for a quick profit, died Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70. Mr. Heymans death was confirmed by his wife, Ronnie, who said he had died after complications from open heart surgery. Mr. Heyman was most recently chairman of the GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials, and a chemical company that was spun off from GAF, called International Specialty Products. Both companies are based in Wayne, N.J. A group led by Mr. Heyman bought GAF in 1983 and took it private in 1987 after the stock market crashed. He later spun off GAFs chemical business into a separate company, I.S.P. During that period, corporate raiders tended to buy companies, cut operational costs and then sell them at a profit. But after Mr. Heyman won a battle with GAFs management for control of the company, he told The New York Times: \There is a very strong potential in chemicals, and we plan to make them grow.\ Mr. Heyman, who was also a lawyer, had diverse business holdings, including Heyman Properties, which owns shopping malls in the Northeast and which grew out of a business he had inherited from his father. \He was extremely methodical. There was a rhyme and reason to everything he did,\ said Leon Black, the chairman of Apollo Management, a private equity firm, and a longtime friend who was once Mr. Heymans investment banker. Mr. Black added: \He combined a strong legal background with a strong analytical business strength, and he was a fierce negotiator. But what really made Sam kick was that he was a builder. It was all about building, whether it was his companies, his real estate, his art collection or his family.\ Mr. Heyman was born March 1, 1939, in Danbury, Conn., to Annette and Lazarus Heyman. His father was a real estate developer. After graduating from Yale in 1960 and Harvard Law School in 1964, Mr. Heyman went to work in the Justice Department under Robert F. Kennedy and served as chief assistant United States attorney for Connecticut. He had to cut that career short when his father needed him to take over the real estate development business. Mr. Heyman made his biggest mark in the 1983 battle for GAF. A group of shareholders led by Mr. Heyman became frustrated by managements resistance to selling some of its biggest assets, including the chemicals business. Mr. Heyman waged an aggressive campaign against the companys chairman and ultimately forced his removal through a shareholder vote - a rare victory for shareholders during a time when executives of public companies were considered virtually untouchable. Once Mr. Heyman took control of GAF, he reversed course and held on to the chemicals business, ultimately making it a big contributor to the companys profit. He also moved quickly to cut costs and revamp the business, saying at the time that he was an \impatient man. When I see a place where money can be saved, I dont waste time.\ Mr. Heyman also gave away money. In 1999, he founded the Partnership for Public Service, which provides fellowships to encourage students to pursue careers in public service. For his charity work, Mr. Heyman won the President's Citizens Award in 2008. His other philanthropic interests included the establishment of the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Center on Corporate Governance at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. He and his wife also collected art. Among their holdings are works by Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock. In addition to his wife, the former Ronnie Feuerstein, Mr. Heyman is survived by his mother, Annette Heyman of Palm Beach, Fla.; four children, Lazarus Heyman, Eleanor Propp, Jennifer Millstone and Elizabeth Winter; and nine grandchildren.

C05764318	Hillary: FYI: I found this one of the most sensible and informed brief articles on Afghanistan. Patrick Cockburn, of the London Independent, is one of the best informed on-the-ground journalists. He was almost always correct on Iraq. Sid Patrick Cockburn: To say this war must be won in a year is nonsense http://www.independent co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockbum-to-say-this-war-must-be-won- in-a-year-is-nonsense-1799296.html Thursday, 8 October 2009 SPONSORED LINKS: Eight years ago I was standing on a hill 50 miles north of Kabul watching the flashes in the night sky as the US air strikes started again st the Taliban front line. There were a few ineffective puffs of fire from Taliban anti-aircraft guns which could do nothing against the bombs and missiles raining down on them. It was a strange war to cover, not least because so little real fighting took place. The reputation of the Afghan fighting man is partly based on agilely joining the winning side at the right moment. In the meantime they don't fight too hard for anybody and try to avoid getting killed. The US and British press mostly reported the war of 2001 as a real military conflict and rather missed the point that the Taliban had just gone home. I remember visiting the former headquarters of a Taliban armoured brigade in the city of Ghazni south west of Kabul. The tanks and armoured vehicles had all been smashed to pieces by American bombs, but when I asked local people how many men the Taliban had lost, I was told \none at all. They could see what was going to happen so they just ran away.\ Just as the US military victory of 2001 was overstated, so eight years later is the sense of military crisis which is being busily stoked by Gen Stanley A McChrystal, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan. In Washington military officials are quoted as saying that the war will be won or lost in the next twelve months. This is nonsense. The Taliban have been able to advance so rapidly in the last three years because they have Pakistani backing and because of the spectacular political and military weakness of President Hamid Karzai's government. But the Taliban draw all their strength from the Pashtun community, which makes up 42 per cent of the Afghan population. They will have great difficulty advancing into areas occupied by the other 58 per cent of the population where there is a Tajik, Hazara or Uzbek majority. Squads of six or eight Taliban on motorcycles might be harassing the roads around Kabul, but there is no need to treat them as if they were North Vietnamese divisions at the gates of Saigon in 1975. The strength of the Taliban is that not that they can take and hold territory, but that they can inflict quite small military losses on the US which are politically unacceptable back home. They can do this through roadside bombs, something the US army speaks as i f it were a new device, though it was being used against the British army in Ireland in 1921. If the Americans and British try to hold territory supposedly cleared of Taliban with penny packets of troops then these are vulnerable to being suddenly targeted by the other side. It is to prevent this happening that Gen McChrystal has asked for an extra 40,000 soldiers. But Afghans tell me that more foreign troops will simply mean more violence and dead Afghans as more of the country becomes a battlefield. It is absurd to imagine that the world's most heavily equipped military force is not going to use its weapons when it comes under attack. Polls also show that Taliban support is at its height in just those areas where Afghan civilians have been killed by American shells and bombs. So what should Obama do? First of all he has time. He is not going to win or lose the war in the next year. Like it or not he is stuck with Mr Karzai and he should get used to the idea. It is reasonable to suggest helping to produce a larger Afghan army and police force but this cannot be done overnight. Most military recruits are there for the money and are too malnourished even to wear American flack jackets. Speeding up security training f or Afghan police meant over the summer that terrified men, often on heroin, were being sent to man dangerous and isolated police posts with just three weeks training. Many of them did not come back. One way Obama could strengthen the Afghan army and police is to make sure their men are paid properly. In Kabul many facilities are being guarded by policemen earning $70 a month, which is not enough to live on unless supplemented with bribes. This contrasts with $250,000 a year paid to foreign consultants who lurk inside heavily defended compounds. Paying the Iraqi army properly really did make a difference in Baghdad and might do the same in Afghanistan where 40 per cent of men are unemployed. A difference is that Iraqi oil revenues last year were $62 billion while the Afghan government is dependent on foreign aid. The US and its allies will have to pay. It is carefully thought out measures like this that Obama should be considering and not the panicky dispatch of US Special Forces or tens of thousand of more troops.

C05773025	The Daily Mail Catty Carla Bruni lifts lid on Michelle Obama's 'hellish' job By Peter Allen and Michael Seamark Last updated at 1:26 AM on 16th September 2010 Michelle Obama thinks being America's First Lady is 'hell', Carla Bruni reveals today in a wildly indiscreet new book. Miss Bruni reveals that Mrs Obama replied when asked about her position as the U.S. president's wife: 'Don't ask! It's hell. I can't stand it!' Details of the private conversation, which took place at the White House during an official visit by Nicolas Sarkozy last March, emer ed in Carla And The Ambitious, a book written in collaboration with Miss Bruni. No secrets: Michelle Obama, left, and Carla Bruni last year. Bruni made the revelations about the U.S. First Lady's feelings in a wildly indiscreet new book In it, she says one term as French president `will be enough' for her husband and suggests he might take tips from his friend Tony Blair: Why not start making money?' More... • France hits back at EU after accusations Sarkozy government acted 'like Nazis' in treatment of Roma According to a friend quoted in the book, the Sarkozys have been 'impressed and inspired' by Mr Blair's fortune built up since he left Downing Street. Miss Bruni also takes a thinly veiled swipe at Princess Diana when talking about a visit to an African hospital full of Aids victims earlier this year. She says she refused requests by French cameramen for a photograph of her carrying a baby in her arms 'like Lady Di', adding: 'There's something obscene in promoting yourself when you are giving of yourself.' Time limit: Carla with husband Nicolas Sarkozy. She claims one term as French president will be enough for him Disagreements: Sarkozy with former wife Cecilia in 2006. Carla recounts a telephone row with her in her new book In the book, the Italian model 42, accuses French government officials of trying to 'kill' her husband with too much work, and claims Mr Sarkozy lets himself be 'bullied' into complying. Comparing herself to other leaders' wives, Miss Bruni says: 'I'm so different. I was a model. I sing, and I want to continue to sing. And on top of that you expect me to be subtle?' And she admits: 'I am a femme fatale, my dear.' She also recounts a telephone row with Mr Sarkozy's ex-wife Cecilia, who warned her that Mr Sarkozy had 'not yet turned a new page' after their marriage. Miss Bruni replied: 'Not only has he turned a page but he's changed books altogether. And you are the only person on earth not to have noticed it.'

C05772385	You asked about this. It was Walter Isaacson. New BBG chief wants more money to combat \enemies\ such as China and Russia Posted By Josh Rogin Tuesday, October 5, 2010 - 4:43 PM The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has a new chairman in Walter Isaacson, and the former CNN and Time magazine chief is calling for even more money for the BBG to combat the public diplomacy efforts of America's \enemies,\ which he identifies as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China. The BBG, which oversees a $700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia, funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, but at the same time is facing increased competition from other governments' forays into international broadcasting. Isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the Congress must allow the U.S. government to do the same. \We cant allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,\ he said. \Youve got Russia Today, Irans Press TV, Venezuelas TeleSUR, and of course, China is launching an international broadcasting 24-hour news channel with correspondents around the world [and has] reportedly set aside six to ten billion [dollars] -- weve to go to Capitol Hill with that number -- to expand their overseas media operations.\ Isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be a major focus of the BBG under his leadership and that China and Iran were the prime targets. \China, Iran, and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies, and Beijing has deployed armies of cyber militias to go after their countrys cyber dissidents,\ he said. \The BBG is at the forefront of combating this. Through constant innovation and technical evolution, our engineers are opening up the Internet gateway for audiences in China and Iran.\ \We know where we stand in the fight for Internet freedom,\ Isaacson said. \Wherever there is a firewall, its our duty to storm it, to denounce it and to circumvent it.\ Isaacson was speaking at last weeks 60th anniversary celebration for Radio Free Europe, which he credited as contributing to the end of the Cold War. He made it clear the BBGs outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively, even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the Obama administration. \Its sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in a difficult position because by law and by tradition its tasked with two separate missions that might conflict: first of all, covering the news with the highest journalistic standards and secondly, being a part of Americas public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the world,\ Isaacson said. \Let me say to you, my fellow journalists, that I will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions, our mission of being credible journalists, because in fact, its the only way to carry out the second mission. You cant do it unless youre credible and telling the truth, and in the end, the truth is on our side.\ Pressed by The Cable to explain exactly what that means, especially in light of reports that the Obama administration sought to influence BBG reporting after the disputed Iranian presidential elections, Isaacson promised he wouldnt hesitate to air views that contradict American foreign policy on BBG stations. He said that the goals of American foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of the time -- as for the other 10 percent, a choice must be made. \I feel it's the role of the BBG to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism, just as you would in the private sector,\ Isaacson said. \We can never compromise our credibility. And in doing so, that will probably help further the foreign policy interests of the United States. But if it's ever a real conflict, our goal one is to protect our credibility.\

Valenzuela, also indicated that has been noted \change\ in the investment climate for US businesses and reminded those present that \in 1996 there was a great deal of enthusiasm regarding investment\ in Argentina. The Argentine Foreign Ministry responded in a communiqué that the government \has not received complaints from US business with interests and investments in the country.\ Interior Minister Florencia Randazzo lamented that \some officials revert to old practices\ when there is the expectation of a new period in US foreign policy.\ Argentinas Clarin carries the same story titled \Official Anger with Obamas Envoy Because He Spoke about Judicial Insecurity\ with the Interior Minister's riposte \Argentina is living in a period of complete judicial and institutional guarantees\ and the nation \has left behind the period in which an official of another country can tell ours what guarantees should exist to benefit its own interests.\ INFOBAE.com adds that Minister of Justice Julio Alak described Valenzuela's statements as \unprecedented and unjustified.

C05770485	He is calling to complain about Ambassador Holbrooke. He feels that Holbrooke is condescending and not forthcoming, including at this week's hearing. He also has broader concerns about the lack of a clear end state and metrics for our Afghan policy, but the main reason he wants to talk to you is about Holbrooke. Holbrooke tried to faithfully answer his questions and frankly Corker was looking for a sound byte and he got one. We can offer him additional briefings and a readout after your upcoming trip if that would help. You could use also this opportunity to thank him for sitting down earlier this week on the New START Treaty; to note that we received and are following up on his July 14 follow-up letter; and that we want to continue working with him to get him to a place where he can support the treaty.

C05768527	Joint Statement by Former President Clinton and Secretary of State Clinton on the Passing of Dr. Dorothy Height We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. Dorothy Height, an icon of America's long march toward equality and a personal inspiration to us both. As the only woman among the \Big Six\ civil rights leaders, Dr. Height helped galvanize a movement that changed our country forever. She organized the \Wednesdays in Mississippi\ meetings that brought black and white women together to find common ground and break down barriers. She never stopped fighting for what she knew was right. And through it all, she was always the best dressed woman in the room. We were blessed to know Dr. Height, to benefit from her grace, passion and wisdom, and to call her our friend. For decades, starting with the early days at the Children's Defense Fund, we worked with her, learned from her, and drew inspiration from her example. From the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to the Congressional Gold Medal, to the unveiling of a long-sought-after bust of Sojourner Truth in the United States Capitol, we had the privilege of helping honor Dr. Height and her accomplishments. Born before women had the right to vote, denied access to the college of her choice because of the color of her skin, and witness to nation divided, Dr. Height dedicated her life to the proposition that all Americans should have the opportunity to live up to their full God-given potential. Our nation is poorer for her loss but infinitely richer for the life she led, the progress she achieved, and the people she touched. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Height's family today, and with her many loving friends and colleagues. She would be the first to tell us that the best way to honor her memory is to carry forward the work she started and the causes she championed, to open wide the freedom gates. May we all find the strength and the wisdom to live up to her legacy.

C05767159	Thought you might be interested in this piece by Joe Nye which I believe validates the new approach we are trying to implement. We have begun to roll-out the new plan and so far the reaction has been reasonably positive. We have organized a set of working groups around key initiatives --- women's empowerment; cve; expanded English language training; cultural programming; youth; climate change; etc so that we can incorporate new proposals into FY2012 budget and re-direct FY 2010 and 2011 funds wherever possible and appropriate. The working groups are being chaired by senior level officers from the regional bureaus --- Bob Blake; Craig Kelly, etc. --- and are being asked to report back within 4 to 6 weeks. I'll continue to keep you posted as things move forward. The New Public Diplomacy Joseph S. Nye 2010-02-10 CAMBRIDGE — The world of traditional power politics was typically about whose military or economy would win. In today's information age, politics is also about whose \story\ wins. National narratives are, indeed, a type of currency. Governments compete with each other and with other organizations to enhance their own credibility and weaken that of their opponents. Witness the contest between the government and protesters after the Iranian elections in June 2009, in which the Internet and Twitter played crucial roles, or the recent controversy between Google and China. Reputation has always mattered in world politics, but credibility has become crucial because of a \paradox of plenty.\ When information is plentiful, the scarce resource is attention. Under the new conditions, a soft sell may, more than ever, prove more effective than a hard sell. For example, the relative independence of the BBC, sometimes a source of consternation to British governments, has paid rich dividends in credibility, as illustrated by this account of Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete's day: \he rises at dawn, listens to the BBC World Service, then scans the Tanzanian press.\ Skeptics who treat the term \public diplomacy\ as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point. Simple propaganda is counterproductive as public diplomacy. Nor is public diplomacy merely a public-relations campaign. Public diplomacy also involves building long-term relationships that create an enabling environment for government policies. The contribution of direct government information to long-term cultural relationships varies with three dimensions or stages of public diplomacy, and all three are important. The first and most immediate dimension is daily communications, which involves explaining the context of domestic and foreign-policy decisions. This dimension also involves preparation for dealing with crises. If there is a vacuum in information after an event, others will rush in to fill it. The second dimension is strategic communication, which develops a set of simple themes, much as a political or advertising campaign does. While the first dimension is measured in hours and days, the second occurs over weeks, months, and even years. The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels. These programs develop what the American journalist Edward R. Murrow once called the crucial \last three feet\ — face-to-face communications, with the enhanced credibility that reciprocity creates. But even the best advertising cannot sell an unpopular product. A communications strategy cannot work if it cuts against the grain of policy. Actions speak louder than words. All too often, policymakers treat public diplomacy as a bandage that can be applied after damage is done by other instruments. For example, China tried to enhance its soft power by successfully staging the 2008 Olympics, but its domestic simultaneous crackdown in Tibet — and subsequent repression in Xinxiang and arrests of human rights lawyers — undercut its gains. Great powers try to use culture and narrative to create soft power that promotes their advantage, but they do not always understand how to do it. Critics in the United States complain that the over-militarization of foreign policy undercuts its credibility. Instead, they advocate diplomacy \on steroids,\ staffed by diplomats trained in new media, cross-cultural communications, granular local knowledge, and networks of contacts with under- represented groups. The centralized mass-media approach to public diplomacy still plays an important role. Governments need to correct daily misrepresentations of their policies, as well as to try to convey a longer-term strategic message. The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda. But its weakness is its inability to influence how the message is perceived in different cultural settings. The sender knows what she says, but not always what the targets hear. Cultural barriers are apt to distort what is heard. Networked communications, on the other hand, can take advantage of two-way communications and peer-to- peer relations to overcome cultural differences. This type of decentralization and flexibility is difficult for governments to accomplish, given their central accountability structures. The greater flexibility of non-governmental organizations in using networks has given rise to what some call \the new public diplomacy,\ which is no longer confined to messaging, promotion campaigns, or even direct governmental contacts with foreign publics serving foreign-policy purposes. It is also about building relationships with civil-society actors in other countries and facilitating networks between non-governmental parties at home and abroad. In this approach to public diplomacy, government policy is aimed at promoting and participating in, rather than controlling, such cross-border networks. Indeed, too much government control, or even the appearance of it, can undercut the credibility that such networks are designed to engender. The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication. Power in a global information age, more than ever, will include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard dimensions of coercion and payment. Combining these dimensions effectively is called \smart power.\ For - example, the current struggle against transnational terrorism is a struggle over winning hearts and minds, and over-reliance on hard power alone is not the path to success. Public diplomacy is an important tool in the arsenal of smart power, but smart public diplomacy requires an understanding of credibility, self-criticism, and the role of civil society in generating soft power. If it degenerates into propaganda, public diplomacy not only fails to convince, but can undercut soft power. Instead, it must remain a two-way process, because soft power depends, first and foremost, upon understanding the minds of others.

Gelb February 15, 2010 I 10:48pm I ....7IKristoffer Tripplaar / SPA President Obama desperately needs a sweeping staff shakeup to save his presidency. Leslie H. Gelb on why he must reassign Rahm, dump Larry Summers, and get rid of National Security adviser Jim Jones. The negative, even dismissive, talk about the Obama White House has reached a critical point. The president must change key personnel now. Unless he speedily sets up a new team, he will be reduced to a speechmaker. It's mostly a matter of relocating the Chicago and campaign crowd who surround the Oval Office and inserting people with proven records of getting things done in Washington and the world. To be fair, it's not clear whether the bad judgments on priorities, practicalities, and steadiness come from Mr. Obama or his White House team. Maybe he overpowers them in discussions, or maybe he gives them a role in policymaking far beyond their experience in that realm. Unless you're there, you don't know. But Mr. Obama is the president, and except for the right-wing crazies, most Americans still recognize his great talents and promise. It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go. It is he who's got to be helped. So it is they who've got to go. One may quarrel with my sense of urgency here. But it's hard to have a conversation with opinion leaders anywhere—and especially in Washington—that doesn't descend into ripping Obama's White House team. The refrain of complaints is always the same: • Obama is forever taking strong stances only to backfill and trim. Most recently, he said he did not \begrudge\ Wall Streeters their big earnings because that was part of the market system. This, in the face of his saying only a couple of weeks ago that such big bonuses were \shameful.\ • Obama doesn't know what's really going on. Regarding the Middle East, he recently said that \I think it is absolutely true that what we did this year didnt produce the kind of breakthrough that we wanted, and if we had anticipated some of these political problems on both sides earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high.\ He had to be totally out of it not to realize that the Palestinians and Israelis were nowhere close to sitting down with each other and dealing. • Obama wants to get along with everyone so badly he doesnt recognize real opposition when he sees it—let alone know how to deal with it. He emerges from a meeting with congressional Republican leaders on health-care reform and says he is \an eternal optimist—when those very same Republican leaders just told the press that they don't see any common ground and believe the administration has to \scrap the bill and start over.\ • It's even hard to follow his latest Afghan policy. He calls Afghanistan a \war of necessity\ and orders more than 30,000 new troops there, coupled with an announcement that he'll begin withdrawing some of them in a year plus, only to see some of his advisers say he will start withdrawals and some say he won't. I've scribbled similar points in recent months in The Daily Beast. And last week in The Financial Times, Edward Luce provided a thunderclap on Washington's negative consensus about the incompetence of Obarna's Chicago-laden team. Luce named names in the White House, and a number of journalists and bloggers strikingly failed to link to the Luce story. They were said to fear the wrath of the Chicagoans. Steve Clemons, author of The Washington Note, essentially eridorse.d the Luce finding and slapped his fellow bloggers' wrists for hiding from this issue. The situation is as serious as it was during the Carter administration. There, two very capable political campaigners--Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell—moved into critical White House positions without knowing very much about doing business in Washington. And they were, quite naturally, too busy to learn. They also added to the \them\ versus \us\ (Washington insiders and bureaucrats versus the regular guys from Georgia) mentality that plagues most administrations. The Chicagoans and others \guarding\ the president create their own \us versus them\ world. It's hard to imagine a policy conversation between the president and the Chicago crowd, since none of them, except Rahm Emanuel, has Washington or policy experience. And there isn't much evidence that they bring in strong-minded outsiders to challenge the president on a regular basis either. The result is an inexperienced president advised by an inexperienced team. Here are the personnel changes being bruited about in political and policy circles: First, remove Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff and move him to a senior political adviser slot. No one I've talked to believes he has the management skills and discipline to run the White House. But he is a terrific political mind and a fighter and should be given the new job and the time to do his thing. Proven pros who could step right in include the following: Erskine Bowles, president of the University of North Carolina and former Clinton chief of staff; Leon Panetta, now CIA director and formerly White House chief as well under Clinton; Sylvia Mathews, a former deputy chief of staff also under Clinton; and John Podesta, another former Clinton chief who now heads the Center for American Progress. All four are tough and know how to manage. Replace Lawrence Summers, director of the White House's National Economic Council, with Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers is brilliant and highly controversial; he's been beaten up and is said to want out anyway. Volcker has unmatched stature, practical experience, and the courage of a lion. He is the only one now in a position to get down to step-by-step brass tacks on the economy and stop Mr. Obama's weekly gyrations. Others with proven track records who can help as inside or outside advisers are: Stephen Robert, formerly head of Oppenheimer, Vincent Mai, former leader of AEA Investors, and Tom Hill of Blackstone. There are also two economic stars in Washington who'd improve both policymaking and public combat: Sheila Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. One outside adviser above all would help the president see the economic hard choices ahead: Peter G. Peterson, accomplished businessman and policy head. David Axelrod, the senior political adviser to the president, needs to concentrate on the next presidential campaign, wherein his expertise lies, and not on domestic and foreign policy, where he is just another smart unknowledgeable voice. Good replacements who do know the politics of Washington would be the aforementioned Podesta; and Tom Deschle, the former Democratic Senate Majority Leader. As for David Plouffe, another senior campaign aide, now in unofficial residence at the White House, he should be lodged in the nearby Executive Office Building. Senior adviser and Chicago buddy Valerie Jarrett is too much a part of the inner circle to move, but she should be given a more limited role in making policy. Mr. Obama's crowd appears to think that getting things done means his giving another speech. It's nice, but not nearly enough. Robert Gibbs needs a rest from being press secretary. Let's put it this way: He wasn't born for daily jousts with pithy Republicans. His job calls for memorable and pointed phrases and attacks, not circle-the-wagon circumlocutions. Possible successors? Try Doyle McManus of the L.A. Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News, or Helene Cooper of The New York Times. Last but not least, James Jones, the National Security Adviser, has to move on. The career Marine was greatly admired and respected as Commandant of the Corps and as NATO's military chief. He handled those duties with great skill. But by wide acclamation inside and outside the White House, he has not emerged as a strategist—perhaps the key requirement of this key position. The person in that job has to pull everything together—laying out achievable objectives and precise plans to dispense carefully packaged carrots and sticks. One Democrat who could step in now, despite his age, is Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national-security adviser. He has a first-rate strategic mind—a rare quality—and knows how to deliver results. Obama will need to iron out Zbig's lack of sympathy toward Israel and Russia. Also available are a boatload of first-class retired diplomats with the judgment and background needed to perform the National Security Council job effectively. They would be greeted with applause both at home and abroad. Try former ambassadors Thomas Pickering, Morton Abramowitz, Frank Wisner, Reginald Bartholomew, and Winston Lord. They have it all. At a minimum, they and others like them should form the core of a group that meets regularly with Obama on strategy. Yes, many of the pros suggested above have reached their golden years. But 70 and even 80 are the new 60. They all possess the necessary energy, experience and rare skill in delivering results. They are also shovel-ready. As a critical bonus, they could and would mentor the next generation down, a very talented one indeed, to succeed them in two or three years. To lead America and the world, Obama has to grow far beyond his present propensity to treat problems as intellectual puzzles—to collect facts and hear the arguments. The great tasks of governing demand proven intuition in sensing what's achievable, which buttons to push when, how to buy the time for power to take hold, how to make adjustments without flagrantly foolish rhetoric, how to avoid failures that only diminish power, and how to succeed in small as well as large ways. With a team versed in such arts and skills, President Obama and America would succeed. Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of powerRule,5-.

It was good I went to Chennai where I had a full schedule including meeting with another self-help group like SEWA (500 poor women showed up) It took me back to our trips. Also met with the local elected village council -- remarkable group of empowered women. I took both experiences to our strategic dialogue meeting in Delhi where we made excellent progress. We also met with the \cookstove\ officials to give them heads up about your initiative (told Roemer too). SEWA will be on stage with you at CGI! Other good meetings with SEWA on markets, Afghanistan, and solar lanterns. Vital Voices conf was a huge succss. I couldn't stay for much but your video was well received, Hormats was terrific (he's becoming a rock star with women!) And F Secretary Rao did a nice job. Our China experience provided a lot of insights and we will do a short strategy paper for you. We moved the women's leadership forum forward. Suifficeth to say, there are so many opportunities that I believe we should be taking advantage of, (which we are not doing) including in the economics track. The women there are growing in power and influence. More later. I'll see you for the NY marathon!

C05771036	Congratulations on the resumption of direct talks. As evidenced by your activity over the past several weeks your involvement in the peace process inevitably has deepened as the need for high-level U.S. intervention has grown. I believe that is a positive result. But the more fundamental issue remains what your role can and should be going forward in order to maximize chances of diplomatic success. I. . State of Play As the U.S. embarks on the next stage in the Israeli-Palestinian process, it faces a series of tactical and strategic challenges regarding policy, politics and personality. 1. At a policy level, the meager results of indirect talks and difficulties in transitioning to direct talks have underscored the lack of trust between the two sides as well as existing substantive gaps. With direct talks begin in the coming days, one obstacles will have been removed, but several remain. Some or all of these may have been resolved in connection with gaining agreement to direct talks. a. How to handle the renewal or non-renewal of Israel's settlement moratorium? b. What is the goal of the direct talks and is there a consensus on this matter between the parties? A comprehensive agreement on permanent (CAPS) that covers all the details? A framework agreement on permanent status (FAPS) that outlines the governing parameters, along the lines of the 2000 Clinton parameters? Or, less ambitiously, a short (one or two page) statement of principles? c. What role will the U.S. play? Will George or another U.S. official be present in all meetings? Will Netanyahu accept that? Is there an argument for allowing the two sides to deal with one another without any intermediary, at least for a while, so that they do not seek to play to the U.S.? d. What will the U.S. do in the event of an impasse or breakdown? Should it present bridging proposals and, if so, when? e. How much work should be done, in parallel and simultaneously with the direct talks, between the U.S. and the Palestinians on the one hand and the U.S. and Israel on the other? Beyond those questions, I am persuaded the most important factor is and is likely to remain what Netanyahu is prepared to do. You have witnessed first-hand how difficult it can be to deal with the Palestinians and the Arab world more generally; how fragile is Abbas's political position; how indecisive they can be. Still, at bottom, we have a relatively clear sense of their positions on the core issues should we ever reach a moment of truth. That is not the case with Netanyahu who either does not know himself or is not prepared to share and who, until now, has neither felt the urgency to reach a deal nor the discomfort of the status quo. Assuming Bibi can be convinced of the benefits of a deal along lines acceptable to the Palestinians, this will not occur solely on the basis of his talks with Abbas, whom he likes but does not truly respect and who he fears will not be in a position to deliver. Rather, it will happen only if he feels that (1) it is under the leadership of a U.S. administration he genuinely trusts; (2) he is convinced that the combination of the agreement and U.S. assurances meets his core needs in terms of Israeli security and international recognition of its Jewish character; and (3) he feels that, again with U.S. help, he can sell it to his people and survive -- or even thrive -- politically. Getting Bibi to accept the core compromises will not be enough, of course. Other basic elements of the strategy must involve reaching out effectively to the Israeli public and ensuring strong, vocal Arab support for a U.S.- sponsored deal without which Abbas cannot say yes and Israelis will lack the incentive to do so. But the point is that a prerequisite for a successful peace effort is for the U.S. to convince the prime minister -- through various forms of overt persuasion and implicit pressure -- to make the necessary compromises. At the end of the day, if Bibi is to make a deal, it will be a deal with the U.S. as much as with the Palestinians. 2. At a political level, the past year has clearly demonstrated the degree to which the U.S. has been hamstrung by its low ratings in Israel and among important segments of the domestic Jewish constituency. This is a critical dimension not for electoral reasons, but because the U.S.'s best chance of influencing Bibi is to build support for a deal in Israel and at home among those who care most. That capacity has been improved to some extent as a result of the successful July visit by Netanyahu and the string of military/security deals between our two countries. But we must be honest: there sill is a long way to go. If anything, the recent Obama/Bibi illustrated a new, potentially perverse dynamic: the U.S. president at this juncture needs the Israeli prime minister to validate his pro-Israeli credentials more than the Israeli prime minister needs the U.S. president to vouch for his pro-peace ones. 3. At the level of personalities, George, with all his skill and perseverance, cannot by himself secure serious concessions from the parties by himself. In recent discussions, both Israelis and Palestinians described him as someone they respected but to whom they would not make major concessions. This is the curse of the day-to-day negotiator. When they are ready to deal, they will only deal with the players they perceive with authority. It was not different for Dennis during the Clinton Administration. This does not mean that Mitchell does not have a crucial role going forward. Indeed, he can be empowered by your more active involvement. The president faces a different but no less difficult problem. He is not trusted in Israel and, though the July meeting might have altered the situation somewhat, not trusted by Bibi. Domestically, he faces a reservoir of skepticism on this issue which reflects many factors, including inexcusable prejudice, but which could obstruct his effectiveness both as an interlocutor and as a salesman. Besides, as we learned during WJC's presidency, it would be a mistake for Obama to get too deeply invested in negotiations prior to the end-point; he does not have the time and should not expend the political capital prematurely. To do so, moreover, would automatically be to devalue the role of anyone beneath him, thus making the peace process as a whole excessively dependent on his involvement. Your Role Under these circumstances, in my view, your deeper involvement is both essential and potentially highly beneficial. It should be a selective involvement; Mitchell still must be the day-to-day negotiator and others also must play a part. In particular, I would not recommend you get overly mired in the details of the direct talks or the set of questions I described above (about their format, goal, U.S. role, etc) other than at critical junctures. Nor would I advise you to get pulled into a Christopher-style shuttle diplomacy which would quickly depreciate your value. Rather, by injecting yourself strategically at the right time and in the right way, you could fill the gaps identified above. This is because you are uniquely placed to address the need both for a higher-level mediator and for someone who enjoys considerable credibility in Israel and the U.S. (Bibi reportedly told someone recently he was prepared to deal substantively with Obama and with you). Your role would be twofold 1. To serve as the higher-level interlocutor on matters offinal status. To a large degree, Abbas's positions are already known; they will have to be further explored and he will have to be pushed, and you should engage him. But we probably know his zone of possible agreement. Not so with Bibi and, I believe, you are ideally suited to begin a series of in-depth conversations aimed at understanding his key concerns, how they can be met, what he would need from us and others, and how far, at the end of the day, he is prepared to go with the Palestinians if his security and other needs are met. Bibi knows and trusts you; in fact, you are almost certainly the high-level U.S. official he trusts most. If you succeed in taking him into your confidence and work with him over time, you could pave the way for an Israeli-U.S. understanding that would underpin an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. At times, this will require being tough and pushing back against some of his most extreme demands (the militarily questionable request for a very long term Israeli presence in the Jordan Valley being one of them) and proposing more rational alternatives. But the point is that without getting Bibi to trust and level with us, without him feeling both what he has to lose but also what he has to gain, this process is unlikely to go anywhere. To repeat, this should not be at Mitchell's expense. It should be a parallel, reinforcing process in which you would deal one-on-one with Abbas and Netanyahu at periodic intervals, for extensive periods of time. 2. To help restore the US. 's image and credibility in Israel and among important domestic constituencies. You have the history, background and credentials to do so here and in Israel and thus to overcome some of the suspicion with which Obama must contend. Over time, through a series of visits and public statements, you would seek to make the case for a peace agreement in positive terms, focusing on what benefits it would bring to Israelis rather than on the costs they would incur: secure and recognized borders; stronger security ties to the U.S. and others; an end to the conflict; normal relations with the Arab world; and strengthened international legitimacy. III. Potential Downsides and Responses 1. Dragging you into the weeds of negotiations. A risk exists that, though repeated meetings with Bibi and Abbas, you will be drawn into detailed discussions over the nature of the territorial compromise, the precise security arrangements, etc. This would be unhelpful both to the process and to you. There is a fine line between discussing the principles that should guide the final outcome and the precise details of that outcome, but it will be important not to cross it. Your role should be to extract from Bibi important understandings and parameters (e.g., security arrangements on the Jordan valley that minimize infringements on Palestinian sovereignty and minimize the duration of any residual Israeli presence) and then have your respective negotiators work out the details 2. Disempowering George. A related danger is to render George powerless by creating the sense that everything can and should be dealt with through you. Besides potentially leading him to step down, this outcome would not serve your interests for the reasons just cited, your effectiveness being a function of your remaining somewhat removed from the day-to-day specifics of the talks. In fact, as I see it, this process could and should end up strengthening George's presently hand by clarifying it. Once you and Bibi will have reached agreement on broad principles, the two of you will provide instructions to your respective negotiators to find solutions that reflect them. In that sense, both George and his counterpart will have a stronger and clearer mandate than currently is the case. 3. Involving you in a failed enterprise. Of all the potential downsides, this is the most significant one and ought not to be dismissed lightly. Failure is a real possibility. Palestinians are in disarray. The Arab world is profoundly divided, with forthcoming successions in Egypt and Saudi Arabia that will weaken two of the states upon which we most rely. And a serious questionmark hovers over Bibi's politics, his head and his heart. As a result, a powerful argument could be made that you would be better off keeping at arms' length from this process, especially given how much else is on your plate. That said, I disagree for the following reasons: a. By not getting involved, you risk the worst of two worlds: being associated with a failure (which, by virtue of your position, you inevitably would be) and being criticized for not having been engaged in an effort to avert it. b. Over the past year and a half, you have been involved -- traveling to the region; seeking to convince Abbas to enter into talks; commenting on the settlement freeze in Jerusalem -- and you will not be able to escape that kind of involvement in the future. The problem is that your engagement has appeared to be sporadic rather than strategic -- that you've been deployed when it has been deemed necessary to get out of an impasse rather than in order to implement a long term, well thought-out plan. I do not think that has served you well. c. While one cannot by any means be confident of success, I believe an agreement is possible but that it only has a chance if we can work effectively to bring Bibi into a position where he believes that the costs of a historical compromise are outweighed by its benefits. d. If we don't try all we can over the next year or year and a half, you will in all likelihood be forced to deal extensively with the Middle East -- albeit not in a peacemaking but in a crisis-managing mode. Without movement on the peace process, Abbas could depart, Fayyad's state-building plan could be gone in smoke, hostilities might break out between Israel, Syria and Hizbollah and the U.S. would have to deal with Iran in an even less hospitable regional climate.

C05778243	STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON The Cancun Agreements Over the last year, the United States has worked with our international partners to build on the progress achieved at the climate change conference in Copenhagen. We have pressed for substantive steps that would advance the vision of the Copenhagen Accord. This month we joined the nations of the world in Cancun for a new round of talks aimed at mobilizing common action to meet the shared global challenge of climate change. Today I am pleased to announce that we secured the Cancun Agreements, a set of balanced international decisions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) which represent meaningful progress in our global response to climate change. These agreements advance each of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord: They anchor the Accord's mitigation pledges; build on a system of transparency with substantial detail and content of International Consultations and Analysis which will provide confidence that a country's pledges are being carried out; launch a new Green Climate Fund; create a framework to reduce deforestation in developing countries; establish a technology mechanism; and Setup a framework and committee to will promote international cooperation and action on adaptation. The Cancun Agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward. In the days and months ahead, the United States will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and to continue building on this progress. ###
C05768128	sbwhoeop Monday, April 5, 2010 6:30 PM H: UK election being called. Sid Gordon is going to call the election tomorrow for May 6. I'm going to go over for that week. Sid Labour c.uIi win most seats at eneral election, poll shows Guardian/ICM poll reveals gap between two main parties at four points — the closest in an ICM poll for almost two years • Julian Glover • aardian.co.uk, Monday 5 April 2010 19.02 BST • Article history Lbr still has a fighting chance of winning the most seats in the general election, according to a Guardian/1CM poll published today. The findings suggest Tory hopes of a defining breakthrough have been overplayed, with the gap between the two main parties now at just four points — the closest in an 1CM poll for almost two years. Labour support has climbed four points to 33% since an ICM poll carried out for the Guardian last week. Conservative backing has dropped one since then to 37% — Labour's best ICM rating since December 2008 and the Tories' worst since February. On a uniform national swing, these figures could leave Labour 30 seats short of an overall majority. Even if the Tories perform better than average in marginal seats — as most people expect — David Cameron would struggle to establish a secure parliamentary basis for power. Either party could be left dependent on the fiber:a) Democrats, who are on 21% in the poll — down two from last week. Despite that decline, the Lib Dems will be pleased by the strength of their position going into the election. The party has been at or above 20% in seven of this year's 11 ICM polls. Meanwhile support for other parties, which peaked last spring in the European elections, has fallen again to just 9%. At the start of an election campaign likely to see more polling than ever before in British politics, today's figures will be treated with caution unless confirmed by other surveys. Some polls late last week suggested the Conservative lead had grown rather than shrunk, and research may have been affected by the Easter holidays, when some voters would have been away from home. Yet the results suggest that Labour's chances should not be written off, and events such as the leaders' debates could prove decisive in the coming weeks. Today's poll suggests 60% of people are planning to watch at least one debate, with 29% saying they plan to watch all three. Only 39% of voters said they would not watch any of them. The ICM survey also asked voters whether they might switch away from their first choice party and, if so;who they might back instead. Labour and Tory support is now equally solid. Overall, 71% of Labour supporters say they will definitely back Labour while 71% of Tories also say they will stick with their first choice party. Lib Dems, however, are less loyal — only 52% are sure they will end up giving Nick Clegg their vote. That leaves just over a quarter of each main party's supporters considering backing another party. The proportion of Lib Dems and ConservatIves. saying they might vote Labour instead has doubled since ICM last asked this question earlier in the year. The ICM figures suggest the maximum potential vote for Labour and the Conservatives — all their definite supporters, plus all potential switchers — is running neck and neck at 42%. The Lib Dem maximum is 28%. Realistically, Labour is unlikely to beat its 2005 share of 36% and even today's poll suggesting it has shed only three points since then will surprise many. Nonetheless, there is all to play for as the contest begins now. •ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone on 1-3 April 2010. Interviews were conducted across the country, and the results weighted to the profile of all adults. 1CM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.

C05769611	Madam Secretary, In advance of your meeting tomorrow with George Soros, below is some information in response to the letter you received from Soros proposing increased USG support for the American University of Central Asia (AUCA). SCA favors providing more USG support for AUCA Since 9/11 the United States has provided more than $15 million to AUCA in support of its endowment and various other initiatives. For a majority of these contributions the Soros Foundation matched one dollar for every two dollars provided by the USG. The major USG contributions to AUCA were two grants to the university endowment, the first in 2003 for $10 million, the second in 2008 for $3 million. Other USG support for AUCA included funding for two advisors to the AUCA president on accreditation and development, support for the journalism faculty, and scholarship funds for students from Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan to attend the university. Soros has proposed that the USG increase this support, offering a 1-1 match of $10 million each from State and his foundation, totaling $20 million over the next five years. Last fall SCA received the same proposal from Soros, and they have been discussing the issue with Soros' staff. A little bit of additional information from SCA on AUCA: The university has made significant progress this year on a number of its key objectives and remains a unique institution in Central Asia, a place where students are judged solely on merit and a forum for free expression and critical thinking. The university achieved an important milestone this year related to its U.S. accreditation, signing an agreement with Bard College under which AUCA graduates starting next May will receive full diplomas from Bard College, an institution accredited in the United States. In addition, AUCA recently established a new partnership with the American University in Kabul facilitated through state of the art video classroom technology and recently announced the appointment of Andrew Wachtel, from Northwestern University, as the new AUCA president who will take office this summer. I will include this note (in addition to Soros' letter) in your materials for your meeting with Soros tomorrow. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike Michael H.

Just shows you that it's near impossible to take issue with the job you're doing it, which is why the political reporters have to resort to the manufactured drama of interactions with the WH. Face was good. Perfect in that it generated no issues to clean up, but other networks picked up clips re Iran. Gates's remark that he couldn't send any new troops before January to Afghanistan seems to be the only thing approaching news.

President Obama leads Sarah Palin 48 - 40 percent. Romney, Huckabee, Palin and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are bunched together when Republican voters are asked who they prefer for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University survey finds. Democratic voters say 64 - 27 percent they do not want anyone to challenge President Obama for their party's nomination in 2012. \The Democratic base remains squarely behind President Barack Obama when it comes to his re-election, but his weakness among independent voters at this point makes his 2012 election prospects uncertain,\ said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \The demographic splits in the electorate when voters are asked whether the president deserves a second term is a roadmap for his re-election strategists on how they need to focus their appeal. Only 39 percent of men, 34 percent of whites, 35 percent of political independents and 38 percent of those over age 35 think he deserves four more years in the Oval Office.\ In trial heats for 2012, former Massachusetts Gov. Romney receives 45 percent to 44 percent for Obama, while the president gets 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Matched against Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a virtual unknown to most voters, the president leads 45 - 36 percent. \At this point, former Alaska Gov. Palin runs the worst against President Obama. Daniels is essentially a generic Republican because of his anonymity to most voters. Obama only gets 45 percent against him while he gets 48 percent against Ms. Palin,\ said Brown. \She is very unpopular among independents and although she recently said she thought she could defeat Obama, the data does not now necessarily support that assertion.\ \Unlike Daniels, who is a political unknown to most Americans, virtually all voters have formed an opinion about Palin and that opinion is not encouraging for her candidacy.\ Ms. Palin is viewed the most negatively by the American people of the possible Republican candidates in 2012. She is viewed unfavorable by 51 percent of voters and favorably by 36 percent. Among independents, the key swing voting bloc, she has a negative 54 - 33 percent favorability rating. Huckabee gets a 41 - 25 percent favorability rating and Romney gets a 38 - 26 percent score. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich gets a negative 30 - 43 percent score. Obama gets a 48 - 48 percent split overall, with a negative 43 - 52 percent among independent voters. In a mythical Republican primary Ms. Palin gets 19 percent, including 25 percent of GOP women, followed by Romney with 18 percent, Huckabee at 17 percent, Gingrich at 15 percent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty at 6 percent and Daniels, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota at 2 percent each. \The best thing Obama has going for him when it comes to his re-election may be that at this point the Republicans dont have a candidate who is both nationally well-known and well- liked by a majority of voters,\ said Brown. From November 8 - 15, Quinnipiac University surveyed 2,424 registered voters nationwide, live by telephone, with a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.

C05774208	Cc: Cheryl, Doug, Justin There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I didnt see and whom I didnt meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw - and didnt see - would be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally, it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization, management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite conceivably confront tens of thousands of childrens deaths by diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we) could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion - I would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true. Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful. Thanks, Chelsea Takeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of importance. Bolded what I think most important.: Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to help them help themselves - this sounds obvious but wasnt to some of the UN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I encountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off Logbase in days - or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and incompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN -UNDP I think - told me she was waiting for the Haitians to \demand their political rights\ - when theyre asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....) In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves, in part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/ INGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures have already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie Vincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head of the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a womens committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a soap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of the most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of the security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2 women from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100 tshirts - at least though I think theyll need at least 2-3x that - so that the security volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people, particularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups of 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol. Finally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less important than the first two asks). IF that option were not feasible, their second choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at night. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They wanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability. The settlements governing bodies - as they shared with me - are beginning to experience UN/ INGO fatigue given how often they articulate their needs, willingness to work - and how little is coming their way. Tents and latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs - obvious to anyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement residents themselves The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still largely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the near (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while rebuilding over next -5 years) The Haitian governments inability to articulate its plan quickly enough or in sufficient terms to the UN/ INGO community has lead to a proliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to help, some of which have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water supplies in camps even though its a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam, IMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the largest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for -40k though given the settlements growth rate its probably 40 for -45k today; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some which have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at night are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work; settlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night while most sit in darkness) This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects on the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced itself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day the Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week - because it was \such a waste of time\ and he said that is representative of the governments current modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was improving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings were \more efficient.\ This lack of efficiency - not to mention lack of visible consistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs by the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The former feels like it shows up to no effect - and the latter feels like very few actor(s) reliably show up Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled around in an action-oriented sense - I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements or workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA; no evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding around however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I asked how many trucks were in the country - including the non-Port Au Prince UN bases - and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO accessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP, for instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the \UN\ / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how many the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and cars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally acknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements residents, by Haitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its narrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its reliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other central locations There is NO accountability in the UN system or international humanitarian system (including for/ among INGOs), this is not new news but it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there is no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the 40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didnt tell the residents when they would come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of the latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British Red Cross should know better—at the least, the British Red Cross subsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ do latrines The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to put it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning - important no doubt - but it has not extended its work into the settlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for settlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have already started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean latrines; guard latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on security patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ drop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we were there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it appeared - on rubble cleaning. Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the responsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard theyre starting to work on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the camps. We met a woman - our host in fact - who working with the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation - had started schools in 4 settlements for at least the next month. The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally - which is probably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and grain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic in the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more systematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet started to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for next week. In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on the ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see guarding the hospital - and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given their effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are covered in parts of downtown with anti ONG (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti. (Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian doctors I met said, \We must be so poor we cant tell them [UN and INGOs] what to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.\). There is also great fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community- that the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total organization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The UN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect. On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is notable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and seminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present. Thoughts on what is needed - and what we could do below. (I know much of this is familiar.): The Office of Special Envoy - i.e., you Dad - needs authority over the UN and all its myriad parts - which I do believe would give you effective authority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the collective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know you know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground, otherwise it could be \empowered\ to do this but it ostensibly already is. However, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a single point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground organized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g., latrines, lights) or by settlements/ Port Au Prince regions with constituent settlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project management etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross- cutting (e.g., pay for work) There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from the above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines, tents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing, maintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/ warehouse coordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I talked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport. A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us, particularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions like where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food and water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those places be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent structures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)? On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with relevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in the settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent wages until a 'market' could develop The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the settlements at the minimum Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials in country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince. For example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were collectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just sitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to locals) laying effectively fallow - and I don't think anyone expects an outbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they and their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely preserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At the least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have received significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general hospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have now offered to rebuild Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both actually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help augment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible The UN/ INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners whenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work with local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any survived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers, etc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term that should accommodate a local dimension Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission should be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work on the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for non-earthquake related cases. Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a succession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the Haitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/ at least Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what the transfer plan is Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively- experienced chaos on Sunday Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking about this now - largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent - but still unclear what the action plan is Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we should work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and actionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican - or even Catholic groups/ prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary expertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would be a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and ex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now FYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it: o Near term/ for the next year ■ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not in the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in place, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or being brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security and safety (though this seems to be people-focused only); ensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the youngest children. ▪ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst geographies for flooding or practical reasons/ other reasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime minister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements elsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO Shelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close to one another • Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above discussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go when the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services once the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how to ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to security (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least 2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec of tent is for any of the above - housing, clinic, evacuation, school and what could be multipurpose; plan for older children/young adults who may be too old for initial school plan; how to best support / help create where needed settlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis, who is in the settlements ® Over next 6-12 months: o Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families to return to and subsequently encourage them to do so; government estimates this will be —30% of all homes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no evidence base) • Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre- existing villages around Port Au Prince where feasible to enable the government to move people out of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move 400-1000 families to each of these as needed o Longer-term: • Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people would move back or what the government's post-rebuild vision looks like ■ Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed before the earthquake ■ *Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the \plan\ Context I spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in Health (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday afternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region Saturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince with: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian government official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison Leslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs assessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to the voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices of those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of Cheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in building a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit, including people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling with, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH - and the person who donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH, Clinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to move goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in settlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian doctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors, nurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc residence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our nights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers (from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID, as mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on and off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers, head of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.

C05761408	This was on Paul Krugman's blog yesterday. I, for one, enjoyed it. Hope you're very well Hillary. May 19, 2009, 7:35 am Ahem Politico: Health care could soon go the way of the automobile, with users having no choice but to buy insurance coverage. Within four years, every American could be required to own health insurance or pay their way through tax penalties. The odds of such a sea change rose last week when chief Democratic and Republican Senate negotiators on a health care bill acknowledged that many on the Finance Committee considered the so-called individual mandate essential to lower insurance costs for those who already have coverage. President Barack Obama didn't embrace the individual mandate during the campaign, which means he would essentially start from scratch in terms of selling the idea to voters. The mandate was a central policy difference with Hillary Clinton, who argued that a mandate was the only way to achieve universal coverage. Obama disagreed, saying enough people would purchase insurance voluntarily if the costs could be brought down. Progressive policy experts widely agreed that Obama's plan would have left out about 15 million people. Clinton, with an assist from New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, regularly assailed Obama for his no-mandate position. Actually, I don't care who gets credit, as long as we actually get universal health care.

C05767259	I get these reports every morning. They are somewhat painful to read since, as you know, in Pakistan, the media can be particularly outrageous. However, we can't ignore the fact that these talk shows are the most watched programming in prime time.. The report below is fairly typical. The host sets up the discussion in fairly provocative way and the guests, who come from across the political spectrum, respond. As you can see, the first commentator is strongly anti US. However, what I, have observed since our media offensive began last Fall is that there is usually a more moderate guest as well, who will argue along the lines that it is only natural for the US to protect its interests and GOP should do a better job of protecting Pakistan. Believe it or not there have even been instances where we get credit for some of the things we do. Also on occasion where there have been particularly egregious attacks on US policy, the host will read a statement from our Embassy in the following programming. We try to get airtime on these programs whenever possible but it is hard. It 's a hard slog getting this right but we are making progress. im
C05771451	Valenzuela, Arturo A <ValenzuelaAA@state.gov> Friday, October 1, 2010 7:34 AM Gonzalez, Juan S; Sullivan, Jacob J; Abedin, Huma; Steinberg, James B; Burns, William J From Arturo - Correa Rescued in Ecuador Madame Secretary: After a tense day in which President Correa was slightly injured at noon by rioting and striking police, and later was barred from leaving the hospital by the same, the army finally rescued him at 9pm last night. Some military units, including the Navy unit in Guayaquil appeared to support the police. The police also occupied the national congress. As the rescue took place, the head of the Ecuadoran Joints Chiefs of Staff issued a statement supporting the president, and noting that the armed forces respect the rule of law \in which the President [Rafael Correa] is the maximum authority of the three branches.\ Things are now calm. Reaction in the hemisphere was one of deep concern. The OAS adopted a resolution; South American presidents at the call of UNASUR travelled to Buenos Aires and are likely to go on to Quito to support Correa. Several, including Garcia and Santos, called Correa. Zapatero also spoke with him. Moratinos tried to reach you at around 6pm last evening to convey that news, I took the call. As you know, we issued a statement of support for Correa. I also gave an interview to CNN in Spanish, which was re-played frequently. I strongly recommend that you call Correa today to reiterate U.S. support for his government and to wish him well. He will appreciate it but, more broadly, it sends a signal that the United States supports the constitutional order and rejects any attempt to undermine it. Chavez in Buenos Aires predictably declared that we were behind the unrest. We have prepared a call sheet for you. Regards, Arturo
C05769746	You ok with this? I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Congressman Jack Murtha. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the hills of Western Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Jack Murtha lived by the Marine Corps credo \Semper Fidelis,\ never wavering in his faithful commitment to the country he loved and the men and women who bravely defend her. In war and in peace, he fought for what he knew was right, even when it was unpopular. He was a fierce advocate for working families struggling with a changing economy and for better health care and equipment for servicemembers. And over the course of more than three decades in Congress, he became one of our nation's most respected voices on national security and foreign policy. Presidents of both parties sought his advice and generations of colleagues looked to him for leadership and wisdom. As Senator from New York serving on the Armed Services Committee, I was fortunate to call Jack a friend and mentor. And as Secretary of State, I continued to rely on his expertise and judgment. I knew that Jack would always shoot straight, like the Marine he was, and never shy away from a difficult question or a tough fight. Today our country has lost a decorated war hero and a distinguished public servant. The men and women of the our armed forces have lost a tireless champion. And the people of Pennsylvania's 12th district have lost a neighbor, an advocate, and a true friend. My thoughts and prayers are with them and with Jack's beloved wife Joyce and their family. He will be sorely missed.

Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said 32-year-old Roxana Saberi's appeal will be \reviewed justly and humanely.\ He spoke at a joint news conference Saturday with Japan's Hirofumi Nakasone, who expressed concern over the case during his visit to Iran. Saberi is a dual Iranian-American citizen who was born in Fargo, North Dakota. Her father is Iranian and her mother is Japanese. She was arrested in January in Tehran and sentenced last month to eight years in prison after a one- day trial behind closed doors. Her case has raised an international outcry

C05761350	Clinton says Iraq on right track BAGHDAD (AP) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton says this week's deadly suicide bombings in Iraq are a sign that extremists fear the Iraqi government is succeeding. On her first visit to Iraq as America's top diplomat, Clinton said the country has made tremendous strides despite the recent violence and continues to deserve support as the Obama administration moves to reduce the U.S. military presence there. Clinton arrived in Baghdad Saturday on an unannounced trip after suicide bombings in the capital and outside killed at least 148 people on Thursday and Friday. The attacks have exposed gaps in security as Iraq takes over from U.S. forces in protecting the country.

C05767107	Blair's guy said you ok'ed releasing today. If so, we'll pull the trigger. It is pasted below: Statement by the Secretary This Administration has, from the beginning, worked to bring about comprehensive peace in the Middle East, including a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. On that issue our approach has been three-fold: (1) to help build the economy and capacity to govern of a Palestinian state; (2) to renew political negotiations to enable the earliest possible establishment of that state; and (3) to achieve these in a manner that ensures the security of Israel and of the Palestinians. Consistent with Prime Minister Fayyad's plan for a future Palestinian state, Tony Blair, as the Quartet representative, will intensify his partnership with Senator Mitchell in support of the political negotiations. In his role as Quartet Representative Tony Blair will continue, with full support by and coordination with Senator Mitchell, to mobilize the efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and governance of a future Palestinian State, including on the rule of law; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

C05769461	sbwhoeop Tuesday, July 6, 2010 7:54 AM The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/07/the-settlement-freeze-that-never-was-and-never-will-be/ The Settlement Freeze That Never Was, And Never Will Be On 07.05.10, By Max Blumenthal 0 Linda Forsell's June 21 photos of ongoing construction in the Israeli settlement of Har Homa expose the illusion of Netanyahu's settlement freeze With the Israeli settlement moratorium scheduled to expire on September 26, the right-wing parties in Israel's coalition government are exerting maximum pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block the policy's renewal. \Lets get rid of the freeze and get back to building,\ declared Israeli Minister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora Yuli Edelstein on Israel National Radio yesterday. \Its our land anyway!\ (Edelstein lives in the settlement of Neve Daniel). Back in the US, the former Israel lobbyist and ex-Clinton Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk took to the Washington Post's op-ed page to praise Netanyahu and Barack Obama for ensuring that \there were zero building starts in the West Bank settlements.\ During the week of June 21, I traveled through the West Bank with Swedish photojournalist Linda Forsell to document new settlement construction and the settlers' theft of water from Palestinian towns. Forsell took a series of photos at Har Homa, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing construction of hundreds of new settlement units — documents of the settlement freeze sham. 0 Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he announced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false distinction between the West Bank and \parts of Jerusalem\ like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli government flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, \Weve made a clear distinction between the West Bank and Jerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such.\ With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go forward. According to the Washington Post, Obamas meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring Jewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Posts Anne Kornblut reported, \The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a moratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September.\ This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was only an illusion after all.

Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks, haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the Obama Administration.... The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate.... by George Packer August 9, 2010 Text Size: Small Text Medium Text Large Text Print E-Mail Feeds Cit and watch us for seven days,\ one senator says of the deadlocked chamber. \You know what you'll see happening? Nothing.\ This is just one of those days when you want to throw up your hands and say, What in the world are we doing?\ Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said. \Its unconscionable,\ Carl Levin, the senior Democratic senator from Michigan, said. \The obstructionism has become mindless.\ The Senators were in the Capitol, sunk into armchairs before the marble fireplace in the press lounge, which is directly behind the Senate chamber. It was four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon. McCaskill, in a matching maroon jacket and top, looked exasperated; Levin glowered over his spectacles. \Also, its a dumb rule in itself,\ McCaskill said. \Its time we started looking at some of these rules.\ She was referring to Senate Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5, which requires unanimous consent for committees and subcommittees to hold hearings after two in the afternoon while the Senate is in session. Both Levin and McCaskill had scheduled hearings that day for two-thirty. Typically, it wouldn't be difficult to get colleagues to waive the rule; a general and an admiral had flown halfway around the world to appear before Levin's Armed Services Committee, and McCaskill's Subcommittee on Contracting Oversight of the Homeland Security Committee was investigating the training of Afghan police. But this was March 24th, the day after President Barack Obama signed the health-care-reform bill, in a victory ceremony at the White House; it was also the day that the Senate was to vote on a reconciliation bill for health-care reform, approved by the House three nights earlier, which would retroactively remove the new law's most embarrassing sweetheart deals and complete the yearlong process of passing universal health care. Republicans, who had fought the bill as a bloc, were in no mood to make things easy. So, four hours earlier, when Levin went to the Senate floor and asked for consent to hold his hearing, Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and a member of Levin's committee, had refused. \I have no personal objection to continuing,\ Burr said. But, he added, \there is objection on our side of the aisle. Therefore, I would have to object.\ Burr had to object on behalf of his party because he was the only Republican in the chamber when Levin spoke. In general, when senators give speeches on the floor, their colleagues aren't around, and the two or three who might be present aren't listening. They're joking with aides, or e-mailing Twitter ideas to their press secretaries, or getting their first look at a speech they're about to give before the eight unmanned cameras that provide a live feed to C-SPAN2. The presiding officer of the Senate—freshmen of the majority party take rotating, hour-long shifts intended to introduce them to the ways of the institution—sits in his chair on the dais, scanning his BlackBerry or reading a Times article about the Senate. Michael Bennet, a freshman Democrat from Colorado, said, \Sit and watch us for seven days—just watch the floor. You know what youll see happening? Nothing. When Im in the chair, I sit there thinking, I wonder what theyre doing in China right now?\ Between speeches, there are quorum calls, time killers in which a Senate clerk calls the roll at the rate of one name every few minutes. The press gallery, above the dais, is typically deserted, as journalists prefer to hunker down in the press lounge, surfing the Web for analysis of current Senate negotiations; television screens alert them if something of interest actually happens in the chamber. The only people who pay attention to a speech are the Senate stenographers. On this afternoon, two portly bald men in suits stood facing the speaker from a few feet away, tapping at the transcription machines, which resembled nineteenth-century cash registers, slung around their necks. The Senate chamber is an intimate room where men and women go to talk to themselves for the record. Like many other aspects of senatorial procedure, Rule XXVI, Paragraph 5 is a relic from the days when senators had to hover around their desks to know what was happening on the floor during the main afternoon debate. (The desks, some built as long ago as 1819, are mahogany, and their lids lift up, like those in an old schoolhouse; the desks of the Majority and Minority Leader are still equipped with brass spittoons.) In the press lounge, McCaskill said, with light sarcasm, \Somebody told me the rule is to make sure people pay attention to whats happening on the floor during debate and not be distracted by committee work. Clearly, its an old rule.\ The Republicans had turned this old rule into a new means of obstruction. There would be no hearings that afternoon; the general and the admiral would have to come back another day. Like investment bankers on Wall Street, senators these days direct much of their creative energy toward the manipulation of arcane rules and loopholes, scoring short-term successes while magnifying their institutions broader dysfunction. Around five oclock, the chamber began to fill, as the reconciliation bill came up for a vote; there were twenty-three amendments pending, all from Republicans, and perhaps many more to come. Ordinarily, debate and voting on an amendment might take two legislative days, but under the rules of the reconciliation bill the senators were to dispatch the amendments one after another, as in a hot-dog-eating contest, with a minute of debate for each side. The goal was to finish the bill by the end of the evening, so that senators wouldnt miss a day of their spring recess—apparently, the only thing worse than a government takeover of the health-care system. The usual longueurs of the Senate, where forty minutes can tick away on the antique clock above the rear double doors without a words being spoken, were about to yield to a frenzy. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, from Nevada, had predicted that the process, known as Vote-O-Rama, would go past two in the morning, and had warned senators to stay close to the chamber. Max Baucus, of Montana, the manager of the bill for the Democrats, rose and said, \This is the first time in recent memory that a reconciliation bill has all the amendments on one side only. These are clearly amendments designed to kill the reconciliation and, therefore, kill health-care reform. So I very much hope that all of these amendments are defeated.\ Tall, gaunt Judd Gregg, of New Hampshire, the bills Republican manager, took the floor. \The position on the other side of the aisle is: no amendments allowed, even if they are good,\ he said. Indignation rouged his cheeks, and his voice rose half an octave. \Obviously, they presume the Republican Party is an inconvenience. The democratic process is an inconvenience. It also appears, considering the opposition to this out in America, that the American people are an inconvenience.\ The Senate chamber is laid out in four concentric semicircles, with adjacent desks almost touching on the crowded Democratic side, and the desks of the much smaller Republican minority spaced loosely apart. The design is meant to emphasize the senators unity. But Baucus and Gregg avoided eye contact across the six feet of aisle that now divides the chamber into two constantly warring factions. Senators are required, by custom, to speak of one another in the third person, directing their anger and sarcasm through whichever poor freshman happens to be the presiding officer at the moment. Rule XIX, Paragraphs 2 and 3—one of the original rules drawn from Thomas Jeffersons \Manual of Parliamentary Practice\—bars senators from imputing unworthy conduct or motives to another senator, and from insulting any senators state. But there is no rule against finger-wagging, and Baucus wagged his at Gregg while shouting at Al Franken, of Minnesota, who had started a shift in the presiding officers chair: \Mr. President, make no mistake, the intent of every single one of the amendments offered on the other side of the aisle is to kill health-care reform. . . . A senator on the other side of the aisle stood up and said that this is hopefully the President's Waterloo. They want to kill health-care reform!\ The voice of Stuart Smalley filled the chamber: \The time of the senator has expired.\ For the next nine hours, the chamber became the stage of a theatrical whose ending, like almost everything that happens on the Senate floor, was known in advance to all. The Republican goal in Vote-O-Rama was to embarrass the Democrats while appearing to suggest useful changes; the Democratic goal was to prevent any change to the bill, so that it wouldnt have to return to the House, where it might be voted down. Several of the Republican amendments had been designed to make Democrats look hypocritical, by forcing them to vote against policies that the Party typically supports. One amendment, for example, declared that the health-care bill could not be linked to a tax hike on individuals making less than two hundred thousand dollars a year. Other amendments were more nakedly partisan, and outlandish. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, proposed an amendment that repealed the entire law. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican obstetrician from Oklahoma, introduced an amendment to insure that veterans diagnosed with mental illness would not be denied the right to own firearms, and another to prevent \convicted child molesters, rapists, and sex offenders\ from buying erectile-dysfunction drugs with taxpayer funds. Coburn got through the minute he was allotted to explain his Viagra amendment without cracking a smile. \This is not a game amendment,\ he insisted. \It actually saves money.\ So many senators snickered that the presiding officer banged his gavel for order. \The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of this Senate,\ Baucus declared. \It is a crass political stunt aimed at making thirty-second commercials, not public policy.\ Baucus asked for the yeas and nays, and a clerk called the roll at a ragged pace. \Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins.\ Thirty-five-second pause. \Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker.\ Ten seconds. \Mr. Cornyn.\ Senators pay no attention to the sound of their name; they cast votes when theyre so inclined—wandering in late, shuffling down the chambers gentle blue-carpeted steps to the swarm of colleagues milling about in the well, where the clerks sit at a table, and then holding a finger up or down. At one point, John McCain— now just one of a hundred senators and struggling to stay in office—spent half a minute waving stiff-armed, trying to catch the eye of a clerk so he could cast his vote. In the end, two Democrats—Evan Bayh, of Indiana, and Ben Nelson, of Nebraska—joined the Republicans in opposing Viagra for sex offenders. The amendment was defeated. The carpeting in the chamber absorbs voices, and during the long night one of the few that rose above the muffled drone was that of Charles Schumer, who said to Gregg, \Get to work! Stop screwing around with health care!\ Sporadically, a sharp cackle emanated from Al Franken, who wandered the chamber, looking for Republicans he could charm into laughing. Observed from the press gallery, the senators in their confined space began to resemble zoo animals—Levin a shambling brown bear, John Thune a loping gazelle, Jim Bunning a maddened grizzly. Each one displayed a limited set of behaviors: in conversations, John Kerry planted himself a few inches away, loomed, and clamped his hands down on a colleagues shoulders. Joe Lieberman patted everyone on the back. It became clear which senators were loners (Russ Feingold, Daniel Akaka) and which were social (Blanche Lincoln, Lindsey Graham); which senators were important (Dick Durbin, Jon Kyl) and which were ignored (Bayh, Bunning). Past midnight, Durbin slumped at his desk, one hand over his face, yawning painfully. Susan Collins was going through her mail. Twenty-three amendments had been voted down, and the Republicans were proposing a fresh batch. \Can we get some order?\ Bunning growled, before he introduced a proposal to let senior citizens opt out of parts of Medicare. It was the only amendment that any Republicans joined the Democrats to defeat. Harry Reid controls the Senates schedule, but Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, who is the Minority Leader, can object. Since nearly everything in the Senate depends on unanimous consent, the main business of the place is a continuous negotiation between these two supremely unsentimental men. That night, they played a game of chicken: McConnell, unsmiling, his eyes riveted ahead, held out the prospect of dozens more amendments; Reid, a former boxer, was hunched and mumbling, playing rope-a-dope, vowing to fend off amendments all night. The two leaders left the chamber to confer privately about how to proceed. Inside, the atmosphere of a slumber party set in. Debbie Stabenow, of Michigan, her hand across her heart, sang a sentimental duet with Robert Menendez, of New Jersey. Exhaustion momentarily eased the partisan divide. Claire McCaskill sat down beside Tom Coburn, held up an erect finger in his face, as if casting her Viagra vote, then let it go limp. Coburn could be heard to joke, \The longest it lasted was thirty seconds.\ At two-forty-five in the morning, Reid suddenly declared the Senate adjourned. The Senate parliamentarian had just found two small violations of the reconciliation rules, meaning that in the morning, despite the Democrats efforts, the bill would go back to the House for another vote. At the bang of the gavel, the senators fled. In the parking lot, on the Capitols northeast side, McCaskill climbed into her S.U.V. Levin, in a cramped sedan, was chauffeured off into the empty streets. On a marble ledge near the exit, Arlen Specter sat alone, a ghost in a brown suit, staring straight ahead, as if waiting for someone to take him away. The Senate reconvened at 9:45 A.M. Around two in the afternoon, the members gathered for the final vote, and the Democrats were giddy. Tom Harkin, of Iowa, and Christopher Dodd, of Connecticut, even exchanged a hug. \Everyones tired,\ Reid declared before the final vote. \This legislative fight is one for the record books.\ He was so fatigued that he initially voted the wrong way. Lindsey Graham came in late, delaying the tally by ten minutes. \Way to go, Lindsey, way to stretch it out,\ Sam Brownback told him. A few Republicans lingered and took in the moment, like players on the losing team at the end of the World Series. After a year of work, health-care reform had passed, 56-43, and for a moment the chamber's Tweeting pygmies had become legislative giants. The Senate is often referred to as \the worlds greatest deliberative body.\ Jeff Merkley, a freshman Democrat from Oregon, said, \That is a phrase that I wince each time I hear it, because the amount of real deliberation, in terms of exchange of ideas, is so limited.\ Merkley could remember witnessing only one moment of floor debate between a Republican and a Democrat. \The memory I took with me was: Wow, thats unusual—theres a conversation occurring in which theyre making point and counterpoint and challenging each other. And yet nobody else was in the chamber.\ Tom Udall, a freshman Democrat from New Mexico, could not recall seeing a senator change another senator's mind. \You would really need a good hour or two of extensive exchange among folks that really know the issue,\ he said. Instead, a senator typically gives \a prepared speech thats already been vetted through the staff. Then another guy gets up and gives a speech on a completely different subject.\ From time to time, senators of the same party carry on a colloquy—\I would be interested in the distinguished senator from Iowas view of the other sides Medicare Advantage plan\—that has been scripted in advance by aides. While senators are in Washington, their days are scheduled in fifteen-minute intervals: staff meetings, interviews, visits from lobbyists and home-state groups, caucus lunches, committee hearings, briefing books, floor votes, fund-raisers. Each senator sits on three or four committees and even more subcommittees, most of which meet during the same morning hours, which helps explain why committee tables are often nearly empty, and why senators drifting into a hearing can barely sustain a coherent line of questioning. All this activity is crammed into a three-day week, for its an unwritten rule of the modern Senate that votes are almost never scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, which allows senators to spend four days away from the capital. Senators now, unlike those of several decades ago, often keep their families in their home states, where they return most weekends, even if its to Alaska or Idaho—a concession to endless fund-raising, and to the populist anti-Washington mood of recent years. (When Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House, in 1995, he told new Republican members not to move their families to the capital.) Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, said, \When we scheduled votes, the only day where we could be absolutely certain we had all one hundred senators there was Wednesday afternoon.\ Nothing dominates the life of a senator more than raising money. Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, said, \Of any free time you have, I would say fifty per cent, maybe even more,\ is spent on fund-raising. In addition to financing their own campaigns, senators participate at least once a week in the Power Hour, during which they make obligatory calls on behalf of the Party (in the Democrats case, from a three-story town house across Constitution Avenue from the Senate office buildings, since theyre barred from using their own offices to raise money). Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican, insisted that the donations are never sufficient to actually buy a vote, but he added, \It sucks up time that a senator ought to be spending getting to know other senators, working on issues.\ In June, 2009, top aides to Max Baucus, whose Finance Committee was negotiating the health-care-reform bill, took time to meet with two health-care lobbyists, who themselves were former Baucus aides. (Baucus received more than a million dollars from the industry for his 2008 reelection campaign.) That month, according to Common Cause, industry groups were spending $1.4 million a day to lobby members of Congress. Udall, speaking of the corrosive effect of fund-raising and lobbying, said, \People know it in their heart—they know this place is dominated by special interests. The over-all bills are not nearly as bold because of the influence of money.\ Deschle sketched a portrait of the contemporary senator who is too busy to think: \Sometimes, youre dialling for dollars, you get the call, youve got to get over to vote, youve got fifteen minutes. You dont have a clue whats on the floor, your staff is whispering in your ears, youre running onto the floor, then you check with your leader—you double check—but, just to make triple sure, theres a little sheet of paper on the clerks table: The leader recommends an aye vote, or a no vote. So youve got all these checks just to make sure you dont screw up, but even then you screw up sometimes. But, if youre ever pressed, Why did you vote that way?—you just walk out thinking, Oh, my God, I hope nobody asks, because I dont have a clue.\ Aides, at the elbows of senators as they shuttle between their offices and the Capitol, have proliferated over the past few decades, and they play a crucial role. Lamar Alexander, who has an office of fifty people, pointed out that staff members, who are younger and often more ideological than their bosses, and less dependent on institutional relationships, tend to push senators toward extremes. Often, aides are the main actors behind proposed legislation—writing bills, negotiating the details—while the senator is relegated to repeating talking points on Fox or MSNBC. One day in his office, Udall picked up some tabloids from his coffee table and waved them at me. \You know about all these rags that cover the Hill, right?\ he said, smiling. There are five dailies—Politico, The Hill, Roll Call, Con gressDaily, and CQ Today—all of which emphasize insider conflict. The senators, who like to complain about the trivializing effect of the \24/7 media,\ provide no end of fodder for it. The news of the day was what Udall called a \dust-up\ between Scott Brown, the freshman Massachusetts Republican, and a staffer for Jim DeMint, the arch-conservative from South Carolina; the staffer had Tweeted that Brown was voting too often with the Democrats, leading Brown to confront DeMint on the Senate floor over this supposed breach of protocol. Bloggers carry so much influence that many senators have a young press aide dedicated to the care and feeding of online media. News about, by, and for a tiny kingdom of political obsessives dominates the attention of senators and staff, while stories that might affect their constituents go unreported because their home-state papers can no longer afford to have bureaus in Washington. Dodd, who came to the Senate in 1981 and will leave next January, told me, \I used to have eleven Connecticut newspaper reporters who covered me on a daily basis. I don't have one today, and haven't had one in a number of years. Instead, D.C. publications only see me through the prism of conflict.\ Lamar Alexander described the effect as \this instant radicalizing of positions to the left and the right.\ Both Alexander and Gregg said that the Senate had been further polarized by the rising number of senators—now nearly fifty—who come from the House, rather than from governorships or other positions where bipartisan coOperation is still permissible. \A lot of senators don't understand the history or tradition of the institution,\ Gregg said. \Substantive, thoughtful, moderate discussion is pushed aside.\ Encumbered with aides, prodded by hourly jolts from electronic media, racing from the hearing room to the caucus lunch to the Power Hour to the airport, senators no longer have the time, or perhaps the inclination, to get to know one another—least of all, members of the other party. Friendships across party lines are more likely among the few spouses who live in Washington. After Udall joined the Senate, last year, he was invited to dinner by Alexander, because Jill Cooper Udall and Honey Alexander had become friends through a womens social club. It remains the only time Udall has set foot in the house of a Republican senator. (Vice-President Joe Biden, in his autobiography, recalls that, in the seventies, a bipartisan group of senators and their wives hosted a monthly dinner: \In those days Democrats and Republicans actually enjoyed each others company.\) When I asked Chris Dodd how well he knew, for example, Jim DeMint, Dodd said, \Not at all. Whereas Jesse Helms and I knew each other pretty well.\ He repeated something that Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, from Arizona, had recently said to him: \Theres no trust.\ Dodd, whose father was a senator, went on, \Thats really all there is—this place really operates on that. I dont think anyone would argue with that conclusion. And if thats missing. There remains a veneer—badly chipped—of comity. On the floor, senators still refer to members of the opposing party as \friends.\ Gregg described Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota, as \one of my best friends in the Senate,\ and both Gregg and Alexander ticked off examples of little-known legislation that they are currently working on with Democrats; Alexander and Ben Cardin, of Maryland, have introduced a bill to ban mountaintop-removal coal mining. Udall noted that he had become friendly with John McCain when they went on a congressional tour of Iraq. But opportunities to bond are rare. On the first floor of the Capitol, there is a private dining room for senators, the \inner sanctum,\ where Republicans and Democrats used to have lunch (at separate tables, but in the same room). In the seventies, old bulls such as James Eastland, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits held court there; later, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did. \You learned, and also you found out what was going on,\ Dodd said, adding, \It's awfully difficult to say crappy things about someone that you just had lunch with.\ These days, the inner sanctum is nearly always empty. Senators eat lunch in their respective caucus rooms with members of their party, or else \downtown,\ which means asking donors for money over steak and potatoes at the Monocle or Charlie Palmer. The tradition of the \caucus lunch\ was instituted by Republicans in the fifties, when they lost their majority; Democrats, after losing theirs in 1980, followed suit. Caucus lunches work members on both sides into a state of pep-rally fervor. During one recent Republican lunch, Jim Bunning referred to Harry Reid as an idiot. \At least he had the courtesy to do it behind closed doors,\ Alexander joked, adding, \We spend most of our time in team meetings deciding what we're going to do to each other.\ In 2007, Alexander and Lieberman started a series of bipartisan Tuesday breakfasts. \They kind of dwindled off during the health-care debate,\ Alexander said. Udall has tried to revive the Wednesday inner-sanctum lunch. For the first few months, only Democrats attended. Then, one Wednesday in May, Susan Collins, the Maine Republican, showed up, joking nervously about being a turncoat; to protect her reputation, her presence was kept secret. These efforts at resurrecting dead customs are as self-conscious and, probably, as doomed as the get-togethers of lovers who try to stay friends after a breakup. Ira Shapiro, a Washington lawyer and a former aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson, of Wisconsin, put it this way: \Why would they want to have lunch together when they hate each other?\ The upper chamber of Congress was a constitutional compromise between popular sovereignty and state sovereignty. The Senate was designed, as part of the separation of powers, to check the impulses of the House and the popular will. For some Federalists, it also had an aristocratic purpose: to collect knowledge and experience, and to guard against a levelling spirit that might overtake the majority. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited the Senate, in 1832, he was deeply impressed by the quality of its members: \They represent only the lofty thoughts [of the nation] and the generous instincts animating it, not the petty passions.\ But he also recognized that \a minority of the nation dominating the Senate could completely paralyze the will of the majority represented in the other house, and that is contrary to the spirit of constitutional government.\ As long as the Senate continued to be composed of Americas most talented statesmen, Tocqueville implied, it would restrain its own anti-democratic potential. Robert A. Caro, in \Master of the Senate,\ the third volume of his life of Lyndon Johnson, argues that after the Civil War • the Senate was captured by wealthy and sectional interests, ending a more high-minded age when Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun engaged in brilliant debate. Aside from spasms of legislation at the start of the Presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, Caro writes, the Senate remained controlled by an alliance of Southern racists and Republican corporate shills, and was \the dam against which the waves of social reform dashed themselves in vain— the chief obstructive force in the federal government.\ By the fifties, the Senate had become far more conservative than the public. And not just conservative: William S. White, in his 1956 book \Citadel,\ called the Senate \to a most peculiar degree, a Southern Institution . . . growing at the heart of this ostensibly national assembly\ and \the only place in the country where the South did not lose the war.\ By mid-century, it had become a journalistic cliché to call the Senate broken. Otto Premingers 1962 film \Advise and Consent,\ based on the novel by Allen Drury, is about the Senate of that period, and it presents Democrats and Republicans as equally amoral, calculating, and power-hungry. But the institution, as depicted by Preminger, still works, in its way: though the deals stink, they get cut. The senators know their colleagues and the rules; they back-stab one another in the lunchroom, then drink cocktails and play cards on Saturday nights. There are no lobbyists, no fund-raisers, no media, no constituents—only senators intricate relations with one another. The Senate is its own world. In a memoir, Johnsons longtime aide Harry McPherson recalls learning that the Senates \famous club atmosphere is based on the members mutual acceptance of responsibility and concentration on the tasks at hand. . . . They thrust hard at one another in debate over serious matters,\ but, he writes, \understanding and accommodation in the ordinary course of the Senate day was essential to sanity.\ Johnson, the most powerful Majority Leader in history, bent the Senate to his will and forced it to become more efficient. He saw his colleagues as either \whales\—the heavyweight chairmen who negotiated legislation—or \minnows,\ the followers who went along with the brokered deals. And when, in 1958, a formidable new class of liberal Democrats entered the Senate—including Edmund Muskie, Eugene McCarthy, and Philip Hart—the legislative machinery began to produce reform. Michael Janeway, the author of \The Fall of the House of Roosevelt,\ worked as a summer staff member between 1958 and 1962. \They used to talk to each other—thats my most vivid recollection,\ he said. \If Wayne Morse talked of constitutional law on the floor, the Southerners would come in to hear him. The same with Hubert Humphrey on farm policy. My strongest impression was of it being a deliberative body, drawing each other out—sometimes pedantically.\ Senators who ran for office in order to work on foreign policy, social welfare, or urbanization had to win credibility with the whales. \But if you wanted to do something there was a mechanism by which you could do it,\ Janeway said. In the sixties and seventies, Southern-conservative control was broken by a coalition of left-of-center Democrats and moderate Republicans. Donald Ritchie, the Senate historian, who started working there in 1976, described the Senate of those decades as \a bipartisan liberal institution.\ The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written largely out of the office of the Republican Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen. Every major initiative—voting rights, open housing, environmental law, campaign reform—enjoyed bipartisan support. In the rare event of a filibuster, the motion to end debate was often filed jointly by leaders of both parties. When Medicare—that government takeover of health care for the elderly—was passed, in 1965, it won 70-24. The Senates momentum nurtured superb talent: William Fulbright, Everett Dirksen, Henry Jackson, Frank Church, Howard Baker. In 1969, George McGovern chaired a select committee on hunger that actually held bipartisan \field hearings\ in poor regions, calling witnesses in migrant labor camps, and then, with Bob Doles indispensable support, greatly expanded the food-stamp program. The intensity of senatorial purpose in those years must strike todays legislators as profoundly humbling. After Joe Biden came to the Senate, in 1973, Hubert Humphrey took him aside and said, \You have to pick an issue that becomes yours. That's how you attract your colleagues to follow you, Joe. That's how you demonstrate your bona fides. Don't be a gadfly.\ Humphreys career advice: \You should become Mr. Housing. Housing is the future.\ The Senates modern decline began in 1978, with the election of a new wave of anti-government conservatives, and accelerated as Republicans became the majority in 1981. \The Quayle generation came in, and there were a number of people just like Dan—same generation, same hair style, same beliefs,\ Gary Hart, the Colorado Democrat, recalled. \They were harder-line. They weren't there to get along with Democrats. But they look accommodationist compared to Republicans in the Senate today.\ Church, McGovern, Javits, and Birch Bayh were gone. Ira Shapiro, the former aide, who is writing a book about the Senate of the sixties and seventies, said, \It was a huge loss of the most experienced, accomplished senators being replaced by neophytes. All of a sudden, in 1981, more than half the Senate had been there less than six years.\ He added, \The shattering of the great Senate has long-term effects that keep showing up. It gets worse over time, but it just never gets restored. There was a phrase I heard from Helms and the younger ones: 'Others didn't want to make waves; I wanted to drain the swamp.'\ After C-SPAN went on the air, in 1979, the cozy atmosphere that encouraged both deliberation and back-room deals began to yield to transparency and, with it, posturing. \So Damn Much Money,\ a recent book by the Washington Post reporter Robert G. Kaiser, traces the spectacular rise of Washington lobbying to the same period. Liberal Republicans began to disappear, and as Southern Democrats died out they were replaced by conservative Republicans. Bipartisan coalitions on both wings of the Senate vanished. The institutionalist gave way to the free agent, who controlled his own fund-raising apparatus and media presence, and whose electoral base was a patchwork of single-issue groups. Members of both parties—Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat; Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican—took to regularly using the Senates rules to tie up business for narrowly ideological reasons. The number of filibusters shot up in the eighties and continued to rise in the following decades, as the parties kept alternating control of the Senate and escalating a procedural arms race, routinely blocking the confirmation of executive and judicial appointees. Democrats filibustered Republican nominees to the bench; then Republicans threatened to ban the filibuster in such cases—the so- called \nuclear option.\ Older members were perturbed when, in 2004, the Republican Majority Leader, Bill Frist, went to South Dakota to campaign against the Democratic Minority Leader, Tom Daschle (who went on to lose). A few years earlier, such an action would have been unthinkable. The weakened institution could no longer withstand pressures from outside its walls; as money and cameras rushed in, independent minds fell more and more in line with the partisans. Rough parity between the two parties meant that every election had the potential to make or break a majority, crushing the incentive to cooperate across the aisle. The Senate, no longer a fount of ideas, became a backwater of the U.S. government. During the Clinton years, the main action was between the White House and the Gingrich House of Representatives; during the Bush years, the Republican Senate majority abdicated the oversight role that could have placed a vital check on executive power. Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the Senate has increasingly become populated by \ideologues and charlatans.\ He went on, \When we do get good people who come in, they very quickly get ground up by the dynamic and the culture of the parties. And once you get there, look at what it takes to stay there.\ He spoke of Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who, nearing the end of his career, spent much of last year working closely with his friend Max Baucus on the health-care bill. Then, in August, Grassley went home and, faced with angry Republican voters and the prospect of a primary challenge from the right, started warning about \pulling the plug on Grandma.\ Ornstein added that similar pressures had led John McCain to begin \altering his behavior and abandoning every issue, including campaign-finance reform.\ One morning in April, I visited Harry McPherson, the former L.B.J. aide, at the offices of the legal and lobbying firm D. L. A. Piper, in downtown Washington. McPherson, who is eighty, had on his desk the firms spiral-bound directory for the 111th Congress. I asked him who, in Johnsonian terms, were the whales of the current Senate. McPherson ran his finger down the list of senators. He did it again. \I'm trying here, looking for a remote descendant. Judas Priest, look at this.\ He was stumped. \Well, I see some good people, I see some people who are going to get coalitions together over time.\ He put the directory aside. \I'm just having the damnedest time.\ Down the hall from McPhersons office was that of Mel Martinez, a former Republican senator from Florida; he was hired last year, two weeks after resigning his Senate seat without completing his first term. (He has since moved on to JPMorgan Chase.) William Cohen, the former Maine senator and Secretary of Defense, has an office downstairs. Tom Daschle works at D. L. A. Piper; his predecessor as Democratic leader, George Mitchell, was the firms chairman, until President Obama appointed him to be his Middle East envoy. One feature of the diminished U.S. senator is the ease with which he moves from legislating to lobbying. Between 1998 and 2004, half the senators who left office became lobbyists. In 2007, Trent Lott, a Republican leader in the Senate less than a year into his fourth term, abruptly resigned and formed a lobbying firm with former Senator John Breaux, just a few weeks before a new law took effect requiring a two-year waiting period between serving and lobbying. When you spend your days at the Senate, its easy to forget about everything else. The House of Representatives seems miles away (its just down a corridor and across the rotunda), the White House is another country, and actual foreign countries are unimaginable. The place remains insular, labyrinthine, and opaque—even physically. Senators commute thirty seconds between their offices and the chamber by electric subway cars that run along a tunnel under Constitution Avenue. Many signs are misleading or obsolete (the gilded lettering over the visitors gallery says \Mens Gallery\), and the Capitol is filled with secret passageways and spare rooms, called hideaways, doled out according to seniority, where senators can read, drink, doze, and wait for the buzzer announcing an imminent vote. The most pervasive authority over the institution is not the Constitution or the Bible but, rather, an impenetrable sixteen-hundred-page tome, by Floyd M. Riddick, called \Senate Procedure: Precedents and Practices,\ which only the late Robert Byrd, of West Virginia, was known to have read in its entirety. The procedures are so abstruse that a parliamentarian must sit below the presiding officer and, essentially, tell him or her what to say. After half a century, the picture given by Preminger's \Advise and Consent\ is still faintly visible. \The Senate, by its nature, is a place where consensus reigns and personal relationships are paramount,\ Lamar Alexander said. \And thats not changed.\ Which is exactly the problem: its a self-governing body that depends on the reasonableness of its members to function. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at George Washington University, said, \To have a chamber that rules by unanimous consent—it's nutty! Especially when you've got Jim Bunning to please.\ In 2006 and 2008, sixteen Democrats entered the Senate, giving the Party its current majority of fifty-nine to forty-one (counting two independents). They include moderates, like Jon Tester, of Montana, and Mark Warner, of Virginia; liberals, like Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island; policy specialists, like Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley; and iconoclasts, like Claire McCaskill. Their interest in legislating has won the admiration of senior senators. \If they can stay, I think they'll be terrific,\ Chris Dodd said. \My worry is they won't stay. Because it's not productive.\ The Democratic class of 2008 arrived with President Obama, expecting to usher in 6 dynamic new era. Instead, their young Senate careers have passed in a daily slog of threatened filibusters and \secret holds\—when a senator anonymously objects to bringing an appointment up for a vote, which requires unanimous consent. On April 20th, Claire McCaskill took the trouble to read off the names of fifty-six Obama nominees languishing in the limbo of secret holds, and Jon Kyl objected to every one of them. Just getting a bill to the floor for debate can require days of tactical gamesmanship between the party leaders. There were times when Warner wondered if anyone had ever quit in the first year. Michael Bennet said, \We find ourselves at a moment in our history when the questions are huge ones, not small ones, and where things have been put off for a really long period of time.\ He mentioned the national debt, energy policy, and the financial crisis. \Yet you have a Senate that's designed not to advance change but to slow it.\ We were talking in his hideaway, a windowless room in the Capitol basement, which had a mini-fridge stocked with bottled water, black leatherette furniture circa 1962, and a TV tuned to C-SPAN2 on mute; Senator Kyls mouth was moving. Bennet, the former superintendent of schools in Denver, was appointed to a vacant seat in 2009, and already has to defend it this year. He described the Senate with the dry bluntness of an outsider who hasnt allowed himself to grow too attached. Bennet repeated a story he had heard. about a new congressman giving his maiden speech: \And then some more veteran guy came over and said, 'Son, you're talking like this place is on the level. It's not on the level.' As the fifteen months or so have gone by that I've been here, the less on the level it seems.\ Earlier this year, the Senates procedural absurdities became national news twice in one month. On February 4th, Con gressDaily reported that Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, was secretly blocking the confirmation of seventy Obama appointees over a dispute involving defense earmarks for his•state. (His tactics exposed, Shelby—whose office maintains that he was responsible for fewer than fifty holds—lifted all but three.) Later that month, Bunning spent several days and a late night on the Senate floor, filibustering to prevent benefits from being paid to millions of unemployed Americans. When Merkley tried to reason with him, Bunning responded, \Tough shit.\ (Eventually, Republicans persuaded Bunning to stop.) These incidents elicited a brief outcry, but the extent of the Senates routine folly remains largely hidden. For example, Grassley and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, have been trying since 1997 to end the practice of secret holds, without success. In 2007, the Senate passed a bill banning secret holds that last longer than six days. But to get around the ban two or more senators can pass the hold back and forth—its called \rolling holds\—and their party leader facilitates the game by keeping their names secret. Many of the Senates antique rules and precedents have been warped beyond recognition by the modern pressures of partisanship. The hold, for example, was a courtesy extended to senators in the days of horse travel, when they needed time to get back to Washington and read a bill or question an appointee before casting their vote. Sarah Binder, who co- authored a book on the filibuster, calls the procedure a historical accident: in 1806, the Senate got rid of a little-used rule that allowed the \previous question\ to be called to a vote. Suddenly, there was no inherent limit on debate, and by the eighteen-thirties senators had begun taking advantage of this loophole, derailing the proceedings by getting up and talking until their voice, legs, or bladder gave out. (The word \filibuster' comes from vrijbuiter—old Dutch for \looter.\) In 1917, Woodrow Wilson, with his wartime legislative agenda blocked by filibusters, forced the Senate to pass Rule XXII, which allowed a two-thirds majority to bring a floor debate to an end with a \cloture\ vote. For decades, the rule was rarely used; between 1919 and 1971, there were only forty-nine cloture votes, fewer than one per year. In the seventies and eighties, the annual average rose to about a dozen. (Frustration with this increase led the Senate, in 1975, to lower the threshold for cloture to sixty votes.) In the nineties and early aughts, the average went up to twenty-five or thirty a year, as both parties escalated their use of the filibuster when they found themselves in the minority. After the Republicans lost their majority in 2006, filibusters became everyday events: there were a hundred and twelve cloture votes in 2007 and 2008, and this session Republicans are on target to break their own filibuster record. The tally of cloture votes reflects only a small fraction of senatorial obstruction. Three hundred and forty-five bills passed by the House have been prevented from even coming up for debate in the Senate. \Why?\ Steny Hoyer, the outraged Democratic Majority Leader of the House, asked me. \Because they do not do their business in a way that facilitates noncontroversial things. Thankfully, the House of Representatives is not becoming the Senate.\ Last week, six House Democrats expressed their displeasure with the upper chamber by staging a sit-in of sorts on the Senate floor. Seventy-six nominees for judgeships and executive posts have been approved by committees but, because of blocks, haven't come up for a vote in the full Senate, leaving courtrooms idle and jobs unfilled across the upper levels of the Obama Administration. (The Democrats also practiced the art of blocking nominees during the Bush Administration.) There's often no objection to the individual being blocked: after an eight-month hold, Martha Johnson, nominated to run the General Services Administration, was confirmed 96-0. On an issue like health-care reform, when the objection was substantive, Republicans ransacked Riddick's \Senate Procedure\ for every conceivable way to delay a debate and vote. Judd Gregg even sent a memo on stalling tactics to his Republican colleagues. Tom Coburn demanded the reading aloud of an entire seven-hundred-and-sixty-seven-page amendment proposed by Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist; Senate clerks, working in half-hour shifts, were three hours into the chore when Sanders withdrew the amendment in frustration. Under McConnell, Republicans have consistently consumed as much of the Senate's calendar as possible with legislative maneuvering. The strategy is not to extend deliberation of the Senate's agenda but to prevent it. Tom Harkin, who first proposed reform of the filibuster in 1995, called his Republican colleagues \nihilists,\ who want to create chaos because it serves their ideology. \If theres chaos, things will tend toward simple solutions,\ Harkin said. \In chaos people dont listen to reason.\ McConnell did not respond to requests for an interview, but he has often argued that the Republican strategy reflects the views of a majority of Americans. In March, he told the Times, \To the extent that they\—the Democrats— \want to do things that we think are in the political center and would be helpful to the country, well be helpful. To the extent they are trying to turn us into a Western European country, we are not going to be helpful.\ One of the mysteries of the Senate is how Mitch McConnell has been able to keep his members in line, on vote after vote. Why do moderates with years of experience and their own power base back home—Richard Lugar, of Indiana; Susan Collins, of Maine; George Voinovich, of Ohio—keep siding with the more extreme members of their caucus? Alexander said that McConnell listens well to all his members, adding, \When you have your back against the wall and the gallows are hanging in front of you, it tends to unify. Operating with forty members—it concentrates the mind.\ Lindsey Graham described to the Times how McConnell exhorted his caucus after the disastrous 2008 election: \He said if we didnt stick together on big things, we wouldnt be relevant.\ Last December, the Republicans decided to filibuster a military-spending bill in order to delay the looming vote on health care until as close to Christmas as possible. Thad Cochran, the Republican ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, promised Daniel Inouye, the chairman, that he wouldnt join the effort. But at the last minute Cochran, who has been in the Senate since 1979 and brings disproportionate amounts of defense money to Mississippi, told Reid that his leadership wouldnt allow him to vote with the Democrats and end the filibuster—even on a matter of national security. (The Democrats were able to impose cloture, and the vote on health care finally took place on Christmas Eve.) Republican defections have been rare. In early 2009, Collins and Olympia Snowe, also of Maine, voted for the stimulus bill, along with Arlen Specter (who promptly switched parties). Snowe also voted for the Finance Committees health-care- reform bill last October, the only Republican to do so. But in December, at the pivotal moment, she voted against the version that went before the full Senate. \I wasn't interested in expanding this program beyond the Finance Committee version—it grew by a thousand pages,\ Snowe said. She wasnt included in the negotiations with White House officials that took place in an elegant conference room across from Reids suite of offices, and said that the Democrats \did not accept any of my proposals. As I said to the President, it was all windup and no pitch.\ McConnell was able to exploit her alienation. A friend of Snowe cited another reason for her reversal: \She actually said to me once that she had never felt the pressure that she felt on health care, never before had that pressure been quite as evident to her or quite as real or troubling. Kyl and McConnell were saying things like 'You just can't let us down, we're all in this together. You're a senior Republican member of this caucus, and you just have to hang tough with us. We expect it and you're going to do it.' \ Reid doesnt use such tough tactics; he has achieved his position, in spite of his public shortcomings, by being the senator who helped other Democrats, always answered their calls, and got them what they wanted through masterly maneuvering. This has made him enormously popular within the Democratic caucus, but it doesnt give him the leverage of McConnell, let alone of Lyndon Johnson. In the current Senate, it has become normal for a handful of senators, sometimes representing just ten or twenty per cent of the countrys population, to hold everything up. And the status quo has become sufficiently frustrating that a few new senators have considered a radical option: mutiny. Tom Udall, who is sixty-two, is older than most freshman senators. He has the crows-feet of a Westerner who has spent time in the sun, and a slow, good-natured voice. His father, Stewart, was an Arizona congressman and the Interior Secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson; his uncle Mo was a legendary Arizona representative; his cousin Mark is a freshman senator from Colorado. Udall served five terms in the House before winning a Senate seat from New Mexico, in 2008. And yet he has the air of a political Candide—he is always earnest, capable of disappointment but not cynicism. \I ran on the idea that the Senate should not be a graveyard for good ideas,\ he said. \Then to be on the inside—the thing that strikes you is how one senator can hold up the whole show.\ In his first year in office, Udall decided to do something audacious: he would try to change the Senates rules. Customarily, the rules continue session after session, and a provision in Rule XXII requires sixty-seven votes to amend them, making it extremely difficult. (\Rule XXII is a Catch-22,\ Ted Kennedy used to joke.) Udall embraced a different idea—the \constitutional option.\ Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states that \each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings\ at the beginning of the new Congress. So, in theory, a senator could take the floor next January and propose debating its rules from scratch, including the filibuster. New rules could be passed with a simple majority. Theres even a precedent for this: moves to revisit the rules by invoking the constitutional option have been made three times, most recently in 1975. Udall has spent much of the past year trying to build support for the idea. At the request of Udall and others, Schumer, who is the chairman of the Rules Committee, has held a series of hearings on the filibuster, calling witnesses such as Sarah Binder, the historian, and Walter Mondale, who was in the Senate when the constitutional option was invoked in 1975. Dick Durbin, the second-highest-ranking Democrat, has organized working groups among newer members on other internal reforms, such as ending secret holds and choosing committee chairs by caucus vote rather than by seniority. (Lamar Alexander wryly suggested to me that Schumer and Durbin were competing for the favor of newer members, in case Harry Reid loses his seat in the fall and they run against each other for Majority Leader.) For Republican institutionalists, such as Alexander and Gregg, the push for rules reform is folly. \If you want a parliamentary form of government, go over to the House,\ Gregg, who is about to retire, scoffed. \Why even run for the Senate?\ Udalls plan for next January, he said, would be a \gigantic mistake.\ \Theyll get over it,\ Alexander said of the Democrats' enthusiasm for rules reform. \And theyll get over it quicker if theyre in the minority next January. Because theyll instantly see the value of slowing the Senate down to consider whatever they have to say.\ He added that the Senate \may be getting done about as much as the American people want done.\ The Presidents ambitious agenda, after all, has upset a lot of voters, across the political spectrum. None of the Republicans I spoke to agreed with the contention that the Senate is \broken.\ Alexander claimed that he and other Republicans were exercising the moderating, thoughtful influence on legislation that the founders wanted in the Senate. \The Senate wasn't created to be efficient,\ he argued. \It was created to be inefficient.\ At one of the filibuster hearings, in April, Alexander, sitting across the table from Udall, said that, for all the times the Democrats charge the Republicans with obstructing legislation, \we could say that's the number of times the majority has tried to cut off our right to debate, our right to offer amendments, which is the essence of the Senate.\ Newcomers like Udall seem to think that the Senate has grown so absurd and extreme that some kind of reform is inevitable. Perhaps they need more time to plumb the depths of the institutions intransigence. According to Sarah Binder, a change in rules is extremely unlikely; Republicans would be implacably opposed to, say, weakening the filibuster, and so would some Democrats, especially long-serving ones. \I would oppose that,\ Chris Dodd said, adding of the freshmen, \These are people who have never been in the minority.\ For older Democrats, who have put in their years, grown adept at working the rules, and now chair powerful committees, the reform impulse could be a threat. (Among senior senators, the sole enthusiast for rules reform is Tom Harkin.) One senator spoke of the Senate as being divided not between whales and minnows but, rather, between bulls and calves. The older Democrats are too accustomed to the Senates ways to share the frustrations of the newcomers; the handful of older moderate Republicans are too weak to challenge the newer radicals who now dominate the caucus. Even if the freshmen Democrats can somehow reform the filibuster next January, the Senate will remain a sclerotic, wasteful, unhappy body. The deepest source of its problems is not rules and precedents but, rather, its human beings, who have created a culture where Tocquevilles \lofty thoughts\ and \generous impulses\ have no place. A few days after passing health-care reform, the Senate struggled to its feet to take on a second large task. Financial regulatory reform should have been the easiest piece of major legislation of the Obama Presidency, the likeliest to win real bipartisan support. The financial crisis had been catastrophic for millions of Americans, and after the 2008 bailout Wall Street had become even more hated than the Senate was. In April, a lineup of bankers from Goldman Sachs appeared before Senator Levins subcommittee on investigations, and managed to appear as arrogant, callous, and evasive as their reputations had suggested. The public demanded action. Some Republicans had a genuine desire to pass a bill. If health-care reform had been a war of attrition, financial reform was a promising liaison. The affair began with a Republican, Bob Corker, and a Democrat, Mark Warner—both multimillionaires serving their first term, both considered centrists. Corker is a small, dapper former construction magnate who became the mayor of Chattanooga; Warner is a tall, preppily dressed former telecommunications entrepreneur who became the governor of Virginia. Chris Dodd, the Banking Committee chairman, assigned them to work together on the section of the bill having to do with the liquidation of troubled firms—making sure that there would never be another taxpayer bailout. They worked through the winter, in Warners office, in Corkers office, over dinner, sometimes without staff, as if they were members of a Senate from the past. They hosted a series of afternoon seminars, inviting guests such as Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and Sheila Bair. Corker and Warner were sometimes said to be the only Democrat and Republican still talking to each other. In January, Business Week called them the Senates \Odd Couple.\ By February, they had finished their work. Meanwhile, discussions about the entire bill between Dodd and Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the committee, dragged on, repeatedly breaking down. Finally, on February 10th, Dodd called Corker, who, though he was one of the committees junior members, agreed to be the chairmans Republican negotiating partner. When Corker informed McConnell and Shelby, they expressed surprise. \It was an odd place to be,\ Corker recalled. \And yet that night we began meeting.\ The junior Republican savored the rare experience of creating, rather than opposing, legislation. In response, Shelbys conservative staff tried to undermine Corker, spreading rumors among Republicans and their lobbyists that he was giving too much away. (A Shelby aide said that staff members were simply informing other Republicans of the Partys line on financial reform.) On March 10th, Dodd concluded that he had to move a bill to the floor. He called Corker and said, \Youve been a great partner.\ He was ending their talks after only a month. \Its a little stunning, Ive got to be honest,\ Corker told reporters afterward. Someone close to the negotiations compared Corker to Dickens's Miss Havisham, unable to get over the rebuff, forever awaiting the arrival of her groom, all her clocks stopped. Corker later said that Dodd had ended the talks under pressure from the White House and other Democrats. Dodd said that Corker had been unable to bring any other Republicans with him. \Baloney,\ Corker said. \If Dodd had reached an agreement with me, wedve had at least twenty- five Republican votes.\ The bill that Dodd brought before the Senate, after a year of discussions with Democrats and Republicans alike, incorporated the bipartisan plan of Warner and Corker to prevent another bank bailout: setting up a fifty-billion-dollar fund, paid for by the banks, to insure orderly liquidation, and establishing a risk council to detect warning signs of another crisis. But in mid-April Mitch McConnell—who had just met with Wall Street executives in New York, and was now parroting talking points from a memo written by the Republican strategist Frank Luntz—called it a \partisan bill\ that \will guarantee perpetual taxpayer bailout of Wall Street banks.\ McConnell presented a letter, signed by all forty-one Republicans, suggesting that they would filibuster the financial-reform bill. His remarks amounted to a repudiation of Corker's work as well as of Dodd's. The next day, April 15th, Corker pleaded with his colleagues, in his Tennessee twang, \Lets come to the floor and lets act like adults. Lets tone down the rhetoric. Lets dont exaggerate the pluses or minuses. Lets do what the Senate was created to do. . . . We were supposed to be the people that took some of the red-hot activities that sometimes come from the other body and sat down with cooler heads and resolved the issues like adults. We can do that. As a matter of fact, I would say, if we cannot do that on financial regulation, an issue that really doesnt have any real philosophical bearings to it . . .\ Corker didnt allow the thought to ripen—he had already gone farther than almost any Republican would have dared. Dodd spoke later in the day and completed Corkers speech: \I know my friends on the other side of the aisle are faced with a difficult choice between supporting their party leadership and participating in this complicated, difficult debate. I am not naïve. I know that is a hard place to be. But if we cant act like U.S. senators for the sake of this issue . . . then why are we even here?\ He went on, \We work for an American public that is sick and tired of feeling like no one is looking out for their interests, like the political hacks and lobbyists hold all the cards in these discussions. The minority seems intent on proving them right. . . . I have been here a long time. I know this institution is better than that. I know there are friends of mine on the other side of the aisle who care about this bill, who want to be a part of the debate, who want to be part of the solution.\ In the same speech, Dodd joined the partisan fight, accusing McConnell of lying about the bill. Turning crimson-faced, he chopped the air with his hand as he shouted, \I have to ask myself, why did I go through this process over the last four or five months, agreeing to much of what they were offering, and there is not a single political vote to show for it. . . . I have to say to the younger members, the newer members coming along: be careful!\ Corker, having heard that Dodd was speaking, returned to the chamber and asked to respond. \You and I went a long way,\ Corker told Dodd. \Then we stopped. On March 10th it ended. I understand that, look, you were losing Democrats on your committee.\ \And I was not gaining Republicans,\ Dodd replied. \You had one, and that is all you asked for when you started. I never said I could speak for anybody but myself. And I did not leave the table.\ Corker urged Dodd to keep talking to Republicans—their differences could be sorted out in a few days. But this was not McConnell's agenda. Instead, financial reform became a slightly more polite repeat of the health-care- reform brawl: the Republicans threatened filibusters, the Democrats threatened all-nighters, and thousands of lobbyists prowled the Capitol, charging their Wall Street clients more than a billion dollars. On April 28th, I was sitting in the ornate Reception Room with Jim Manley, Reid's spokesman. On the other side of the wall, there was the noise of furniture scraping across a tile floor. \Those are cots being set up in the L.B.J. Room,\ Manley said. \Very little happens around here without a deadline.\ The cots persuaded Republicans to allow the bill to move to the floor for debate. A few weeks later, on May 20th, yet another filibuster was defeated by yet another cloture motion, and financial reform finally came to a vote. It passed, 59-39. Only four Republicans had joined the majority. Corker wasn't among them. He had even voted for an amendment, offered by his Republican colleague Jeff Sessions, of Alabama, that would have scrapped Corker's work of many months with Warner. \The idea of watching Bob Corker vote for the Sessions amendment!\ Dodd said afterward, sitting in his red-curtained office, under a print of Holbein's portrait of Thomas More. \Its the Senate, I guess.\ McConnells strategy of obstruction had once again come close to succeeding, Dodd said, but he knew that a \shrinking number\ of Republicans were frustrated. The previous day, Dodd had said to Susan Collins, \God, I would have loved to have you as my ranking member on this.\ Collins responded, \We could have had such a great time on this bill.\ Warner, who said that he believed in bipartisanship because \the American people don't trust either political party enough to give them a blank check,\ was astonished that so few Republicans voted for financial reform. \There was zero substantive reason why this couldn't have been eighty votes,\ he said. I asked him why Bob Corker had voted no on the bill. Warner started to talk about the consumer-protection title, and then said, \If you want to vote against something, you can always find your reasons.\ But Corker hadnt seemed to want to vote against it. He had spent months trying to act like a U.S. senator, alienating himself from his own party and then the other party, and on the day of the vote he held the floor for the better part of thirty minutes, as if he were still reluctant to let the effort go. \I am obviously disappointed,\ he said. \I think I have spent as much time as any senator. . . on policy regarding our financial system. I think any bill—even this bill—has good things in it. There is no question. And I appreciate the thrust. But I think there is a lot of overreaching, and I think not enough time was spent on some of the core issues.\ As the senators cast their votes, I noticed Robert Kaiser, the author of \So Damn Much Money,\ in the press gallery. I later asked him if, with the passage of two big reform bills in three months, we were witnessing a possible renewal of the Senate. \If you can engage public opinion in a way politicians can understand, public opinion can still blow away money and interest groups,\ he said. \But over the past few decades the reflex has grown in the Senate that, all things considered, its better to avoid than to take on big issues. This is the kind of thing that drives Michael Bennet nutty: here youve arrived in the United States Senate and you cant do fuck-all about the destruction of the planet.\ After the final vote on financial reform, the Republicans flew home, and the Democratic leaders held a press conference, smiling before the microphones outside the Senate chamber. Reid said, \For those who wanted to protect Wall Street, it didnt work.\ He then excused himself: he had to join Biden for a telephone fund-raiser with \some Nevadans.\ Durbin said, \I was stunned that only four Republicans would join us in passing this historic legislation. What does it take to bring the Republican Party into the conversation about the future of America?\ Dodd, glowing with triumph, said, \I wanted to demonstrate that the Senate of the United States could conduct its business much as our founders intended. We did that.\ On July 21st, President Obama signed the completed bill. The two lasting achievements of this Senate, financial regulation and health care, required a year and a half of legislative warfare that nearly destroyed the body. They depended on a set of circumstances—a large majority of Democrats, a charismatic President with an electoral mandate, and a national crisis—that will not last long or be repeated anytime soon. Two days after financial reform became law, Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not take up comprehensive energy-reform legislation for the rest of the year. And so climate change joined immigration, job creation, food safety, pilot training, veterans care, campaign finance, transportation security, labor law, mine safety, wildfire management, and scores of executive and judicial appointments on the list of matters that the worlds greatest deliberative body is incapable of addressing. Already, you can feel the Senate slipping back into stagnant waters.

C05769272	FYI we are putting out the following statement. STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON Bombing of the Shrine of Syed Ali Hujviri in Lahore I was shocked and saddened by yesterday's attack on one of Pakistan's most popular places of worship, the Shrine of Syed All Hujviri (Data Ganjbakhsh) in Lahore, which claimed the lives of many innocent Pakistanis. The extremists have shown that they respect neither human dignity nor the fundamental religious values of Pakistani society. Violating the sanctity of this revered shrine is a particularly sinister attempt to destabilize Pakistan and to intimidate its people. The attackers will not succeed, as the Pakistani public refuses to be cowed by such violence. We condemn this brutal crime and reaffirm our commitment to support the Pakistani people in their efforts to defend their democracy from the violent extremists who seek to destroy it. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and with all the people of Pakistan. ###

C05769136	Here's a basic summary: It focused on citing the illegitimacy of US nuclear and nonproliferation policy, and on highlighting that it is the nuclear weapons states which are to blame for both proliferation and global instability. The speech suggested that US nonproliferation efforts are a cynical attempt to divert attention from our aim to keep nuclear weapons for ourselves and that even things like the Nuclear Summit are nothing more than such a veil. The speech made several pointed attacks on the USG, from the USAF's security issue a few years ago to our use of nuclear weapons in WWII (making us \the most hated\ in history) to allegations of support for terrorism (including that only states who have and have used nuclear weapons could support nuclear terrorism). The speech offered 11 \proposals\, most of which were previewed in Tehran press today. These include legally binding NSAs, suspension of IAEA membership for those who threaten with nuclear weapons, disarming all US nuclear bases, support for a ME w/o nuclear weapons and restructure of the UNSC. The US del walked out -- with many partners -- in response to this speech.

But in terms of setting expectations it would be a combo of a few overt and not overt things: - Seeing what Admin/For Pol Members of Congress are on TV today and the shows tomorrow, all we need is one person to float it. - We have flight time tomorrow when Tom & Jake can do it on background or OTR. - There's one blogger that folks loosely follow, I know how to get her something through a 3rd party. - I have to talk to a few of our guys today like Matt Lee on misc stuff, and I'm sure he'll ask me something about the OAS where I can easily say the folks in WHA are real pessimistic. And our travelers traffic info among themselves. The best thing to put out there would be the notion that there are those who don't think you should go. If you don't, you don't. But if you do, you chose to be direct, to make a principled stand. Shouldn't be too tough, because the notion of Cuba being voted in is something they will WANT to believe, it'll make good copy. And it makes it easier to explain any decision/outcome

C05764643	Apparently you can't get away from me. We're sharing the FT op-ed page tomorrow. Here's my piece.... Thanks again for Friday. Much favorable comment. Good luck at the UNGA. President Barack Obama's announcement of a new system.for protecting America's allies against Iranian missiles has ignited charges that he is scaling back the one he inherited from George W. Bush as a concession to the Russians. In fact, the Obama plan is a big improvement on the Bush one, and it is designed to counter an evolving Iranian threat, not to mollify Russian anxieties. Mr Bush's decision to put 10 missile interceptors in Poland and an associated radar in the Czech Republic was based on a concern that Iran was developing long-range rockets that could hit the US. The Bush system would have been less effective against shorter- range Iranian missiles, and it would have left much of Europe, notably including America's ally Turkey, unprotected. Over the last several years, the Iranians have shifted their efforts from developing a few long-range rockets to deploying large numbers of shorter-range ones that pose an immediate danger to southeastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as to US forces stationed there. Unlike Mr Bush's, Mr Obama's plan will quickly field a missile-defence capability to address an existing threat. It can be upgraded to deal with longer-range Iranian missiles in the future. The Central Europeans who have reacted to the decision with apprehension or alarm should recognize that the replacement of a conceptually flawed plan with a more credible one strengthens the bonds of transatlantic defence. The view from Moscow has been clouded by outright paranoia. Military experts there suspected that the US rockets in Poland, while advertised as defensive, could be used offensively, even pre-emptively, against Russia. Laying to rest that far-fetched scenario was not the prime motivation for Mr Obama's decision, nor should it have been. However, by removing what has been a gratuitous irritant in bilateral relations, the president has improved the prospects for US-Russian arms control negotiations now underway in Geneva. Those talks could produce by December a new treaty reducing numbers of strategic - that is, intercontinental — weapons. If ratified by the US Senate (which will not be easy, given the ferocity of the partisan wars in Washington), the US and Russia will be on track for further reductions in the future. Mr Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, who are due to meet in New York this week, have jointly called for the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. As they and their successors take steps in that direction, they will have to grapple with a stark paradox of the nuclear age: mutual deterrence depends on each side being vulnerable to retaliation from the other. If either side has enough defences to trump the other side's offence, the mutuality of deterrence breaks down and one or both sides will be on hair-trigger, making war more likely in a crisis. American statesmen pounded this inescapable truth into the heads of their initially sceptical Soviet counterparts 40 years ago. The result was the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed by Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev in 1972. By limiting the defensive capability of both superpowers, the ABM treaty was a necessary companion piece to a series of treaties setting ceilings on offensive weaponry. Because nuclear weapons were expected to with us forever, the ABM treaty was meant to last in perpetuity. While the Soviets were converted to the logic of restricting defence, Ronald Reagan was not. The late US president championed the development of a space-based comprehensive shield that would make offensive weapons — and therefore mutual deterrence — \impotent and obsolete.\ Many experts believed Reagan's vision, which they derisively nicknamed Star Wars, was an impossible dream. So did his successor, George H. W. Bush, who treated the program with benign neglect while negotiating with the Russians in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) begun by Mr Reagan. The second president Bush reversed his father's policy. He greatly weakened the START process, pulled the US out of the ABM treaty and sought to revive a national missile defence (NMD) system. His decision to build the interceptor and radar sites in Poland and the Czech Republic was, as one of his aides told me at the time, in large measure about \pouring concrete for what will eventually be a global NMD.\ Key officials of the Obama administration — including the president himself, who studied arms control in college — understand the linkage between reduction of offences and regulation of defences. However, they have avoided raising that issue in the context of last week's decision. That is partly because they want their plan to be judged on its own merits, vis-à-vis the Iranian threat. But it is because they have more than enough fights with the Republicans without further energizing the right wing by trying to reinstate the principles of the ABM treaty. Yet sooner or later the US administration will have to grasp the nettle of regulating strategic defences. Otherwise, continued reductions in strategic nuclear offences will be either impossible or, worse, dangerous. The author is president of the Brookings Institution.
C05769624	Gaza: it's Hamas's move now Hamas must seize the initiative if there is ever to be an end to Israel's occupation of Palestine • • c) Jeremy Greenstock o quardian.co.uk, Wednesday 2 June 2010 12.29 BST So it has happened again. Nearly 18 months after the Israelis bombed Gaza to a wasteland, with barely a load of building materials allowed in since then, Turkey has taken the brunt of an operation of humanitarian assistance gone wrong. The UN must establish the facts impartially and independently and, if laws have been broken, those responsible must be held to account. Political demonstrations posing as relief flotillas go wrong too easily and Israel understandably has to prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza. But was this really the best way to bring the ships to shore for examination? A commando attack on civilian ships looks callous and disproportionate. No one should have been hurt, whatever the emotions behind all this. Why is Gaza under siege in the first place? Under international law, the Israelis are responsible as the occupying force for the proper administration of the territory; and half the point of Israel is not to be above the law. Yet they are creating a traumatised territory of 1.5m neighbours, many of whose children seem to want to grow up to be suicide bombers. They are also pouring fertiliser on al-Qaida's ground. The director of UNRWA operations in Gaza, John Ging, gave a speech in London this week entitled \Illegal, inhuman. and insane: a medieval siege on Gaza in 2010\. This objective humanitarian practitioner should be listened to. How has Israel, the only democracy in its region and a symbol of the need for racially inspired violence to end, come to risk any claim to international legitimacy in its handling of this situation? Hamas are the enemy of Israel, but they do not have to be. They preach violent resistance too readily, yet over the past 17 months they have been trying to control the militant groups intent on threatening Israel with rockets — imperfectly perhaps, but not a single Israeli citizen has been killed (alas, one immigrant worker was) by a rocket since the Gaza bombing stopped in January 2009. They are also the implacable opponents of al-Qaida. They won a fair election in 2006 and claim to respect democracy. Let's test them on that. At present, Hamas security people are being sniped at by the Israeli Defence Forces when they try to arrest other militant groups. This is genuinely getting insane. The unwisdom of reliance on angry military responses is all the clearer when the mood in Palestine, in both the West Bank and Gaza, is steadily moving towards a negotiated end to the occupation. I am convinced from my own direct experience that Hamas is prepared to establish and respect a long-term ceasefire so that the talking can start without the threat of violence, and that they would enter in good faith, if that were reciprocated, into negotiations to establish two states in the disputed territories, Israel and Palestine, with their own rights and responsibilities under international law. The distortion of their position, a little of it the fault of their own PR, does no side any good. If a comprehensive negotiation is too much to expect for now, what about a first step? I believe an arrangement to end the blockade is within reach if only Israel, Egypt and Gaza would test the possibilities of dialogue. Hamas have indicated that they could cease all attacks on Israeli soil, close the tunnels, release Gilead Shalit and stop the import of arms into Gaza if the blockade was ended, an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners were released and Gaza began to be rebuilt. The Palestinians of course have work to do on their own internal reconciliation, while the relationship between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza remains so bad. But the UN, the US, Russia, the EU and the Arab world must make a much more serious attempt to test the possibilities, putting ordinary Israelis and Palestinians first, not their own political comfort. We are coming close to losing the chance of a two-state solution. US policy, based on a West-Bank-only approach, is locked in a cul-de-sac if Gaza is left out of the equation, because majority Palestinian support will be lacking. Israel is confident in the knowledge that it cannot be militarily defeated. But that ignores the huge danger of losing the political, diplomatic, legal and moral high ground. This matters in today's world, as the US and the UK discovered in Iraq, because government authority and public opinion interact closely, and legitimacy breeds support. Israel's relationship with Turkey was the key to a broader understanding with the Islamic community and others beyond the west. That now lies in tatters. If Israel is left as the permanent occupier, or controlling a one-state structure with part of its population downgraded or imprisoned, it will truly be a disaster for its people and what they stand for. I hope that Hamas will not sit back and enjoy Israel's discomfiture. They have so far, for a political organisation, attracted much too narrow a range of international support. If they wish to be widely accepted as a negotiating partner, they must unequivocally accept the only fully justified condition set by the international Quartet — the cessation of violence — underline that their objective is a two-state settlement, and win international friends for the ending of the occupation. In whoever's hands, bombs, bullets, rockets and iron bars will achieve nothing. But a push for justice will. •This article was originally written for the Times but not published

C05764001	pvervee Secretary Clinton — I understand you are going to Kenya next week and while I know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues, I wanted to flag an issue for you because I know it is near and dear to your heart. Kenya has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in Africa — it is illegal unless a woman's life is at risk and criminalizes both the woman and the provider. Two years ago, Kenyan authorities imprisoned a doctor and two nurses, falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions. After a year in prison, the providers were found innocent and released, but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed a coalition to make abortion less restrictive. It will come as no surprise to you that, as a result of their abortion law, Kenya has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Africa, with an estimated 800 women a day seeking the procedure, often through dangerous means. Kenya is restarting a long-stalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce a final Constitution by next year. Religious groups are on a concerted crusade to include new language in the Constitution which would codify that \life begins at conception\. The current Constitution is largely silent on the issue. If this fetal personhood amendment goes forward, it would place Kenya in the small community of nations with such a provision. It would clearly mark Kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the African Union's Maputo Protocol, one of the most progressive regional documents on women, development and reproductive rights, and with the vast majority of African countries in general. For a country trying to regain the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently, such a policy imposition would be a regression for women's rights and for the country writ large. I went to Kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the Constitutional amendment and to work toward a less restrictive abortion law. I also visited several of our clinics and providers in Nairobi and in nearby villages where Planned Parenthood has programs to train providers in post abortion care. You have seen this a million times in your travels around the world, so I don't need to tell you how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost, the bravery in standing up to constant government harassment, and the fear of what this potential Constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe medical services. I know it is asking a lot, but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue when you are in Kenya, you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are. It is our hope that if Kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed. Of course we would be happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there. There is also a Congressional delegation going to Kenya the week of August 8th and we are working on them to have a side meeting on this issue as well. As always, thank you so much for all you do. We are all so grateful that you are there! All best, Laurie Laurie Rubiner Vice President of Public Policy and Advocacy Planned Parenthood Federation of America (202) 973-4863 office

C05769529	Below and attached is a proposed draft for a speech next Thursday at CFR. You'll recall that we discussed this with you at the last speech meeting. The idea is to give a speech one year after your last CFR address that updates and amplifies the frame you outlined, and fills it in with the work of the past year. The speech will also underscore the continuity between your speech and the National Security Strategy. The below draft still needs a good bit of work, but we have between now and next Thursday to get it into shape. AMS was initially skeptical, but I think she believes the speech is heading in the right direction (she'll write you with specific comments ... I have my own suggestions for further improvement) and that on balance it should be given. Derek is a strong proponent of the speech, and Jim, who has not read a draft, embraced the concept. ***DRAFT*** SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON REMARKS AT COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS WASHINGTON, DC JULY 15, 2010 B5 B5 B5 B5 B - Thank you. ###

C05769710	Just saw the email from Sid - was working on the below report. Shaun apparently had a much more pessimistic view of what Cameron would do than all of our Parliament watchers, who felt confident from the get-go that he would support the deal. PM Brown praised all parties involved; stressed the need to adhere to the dates laid out in the agreement several times; welcomed the supportive Westminster interventions during the Q and A of SDLP Mark Durkan and DUP Peter Robinson and Nigel Dods, but pointedly expressed hope that other parties (read UUP, whose MP was either not present or simply didn't speak) would express their support as soon as possible. As expected, David Cameron praised the agreement and all parties; raised the desire that all parties (read SDLP and UUP) be given time to review the document; and pointedly asked the PM what issues that were not expressly mentioned in the agreement would be addressed by the Working Group -- to which Brown responded, \all the issues outstanding from St Andrews.\ Cameron and Brown praised the U.S. role, singling you out. Brown also twice referred to your offer to host an investment conference. Overall, nothing concerning from the Tories...on the contrary, full support, a request that the minority parties have a chance to review and some questions on outstanding issues. UUP MLAs meet tonight to review. Note: DUP interventions were balanced.. .Dods raised parades and decommissioning as reminder of outstanding issues, but stressed desire of all parties \not to go back\ to the bad old days.

C05765689	This evening cloture was invoked on the motion to proceed to Majority Leader Reids health care bill, 60 to 39. It was a straight party line vote. Despite some early concern over how they would vote, Senators Ben Nelson, Landrieu, and Lincoln voted with the caucus. Each has warned theyre not a guaranteed \yes\ vote on final passage. Senators voted from their seats, and Senator Dodd sat in the chair during the vote. The vote was followed by brief applause. Per the UC agreement negotiated by Reid and McConnell, this evenings cloture vote will also double as the vote on the underlying motion to proceed, meaning the Senate will recess after the vote and will be on the health care bill when it returns from the Thanksgiving recess.

More than a million spectators gathered before the Capitol on a frosty January afternoon to witness the inauguration of Barad< Obama, who promised in his campaign to change Washingtons mercenary culture of lobbyists, special interest influence and backroom deals. But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting down with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care reform possible. Over the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of times to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administrations health care reform agenda in exchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the presidents promises to reform the pharmaceutical industry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push their case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and Federal Election Commission records, White House visitor logs and the sghedu! ..S,:::in. Max,Baucus releases yoiun:tarily--is a testament to how ingrained the grip of special interests remains in Washington. In the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nations health care system, but also supported key qemocr.atic health reform uok, sies. Among these were several that targeted the pharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices and providing Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program. These werent just promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Rdl Call Vote 132 and Roll call Vo.t.c.-) 150.) Set to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina. Emanuel was a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official, investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in Congress. Messina was the former campaign manager B6 and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their unparalleled legislative abilities. Because of Obamas decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also played key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Bpuf. -4:s. Baucus would be the vehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and PhRMA. Central to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of Congress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties Tauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washingtons mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription drug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare would not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries would not be allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and would be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million. Tauzins job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring of 2008 simply titled \.Biliy.\ It featured the candidate, sleeves rolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of Washington. \The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug companies. And you know what, the chairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making $2 million a year.\ The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, \Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses Washington lobbyist money,\ while the candidate continues his lecture, \Imagine that. Thats an example of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I dont want to learn how to play the game better, I want to put an end to the game playing.\ Aiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities. Over the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group sdeft:tow::!i: _ 520 tniliion on in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from PhRMAs massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48 outside lobbying firms. The total number of lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165 lobbyists representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens were former congressional staffers including two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus. According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers coptr.ibu■ed sums to ....:ongressional ecii-om.lttee.s during the same period--from January to the end of October (4thquarter numbers are still being totaled), industry political action committees, employees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million. Those contributions tilted heavily to Democrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any election cycle going back to 1990, the first year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that Democrats were so favored. Given their majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new Presidents intention to reform Americas health care system, the new tilt was perhaps not surprising. On March 5, the White House a Tee.tiilfa....ivitfi.rnnic!r_nealth care induLd.er.s to try to bring them to the table and see what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for PhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, Americas Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen lgnani, Tom Donohue of the Chamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations Rise Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House meeting Tauzin 31)12.7.a_f;=■.:4_1 .7...-1 Ci\IF: . .lc touting health care reform and promising to work closely with the Obama administration. In the interview he touted it as an \optimistic plan\, acknowledging that the industry did have a few problems but was glad to have a chance to discuss these. Spme were duri?0,7rognnd,, ,td by this apparent change of heart on behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms. On April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor and health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote reform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entftelv funoed pj . PhRMA. The two groups spent $24 million on their advertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to White House Senior Advisor David AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million. In the next month, CEOs from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least four times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health care reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups piedaed cost , ..-v_itting_measures to the White House that would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade. President Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the administration followed up with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site. The next day, Healthy Economy Nows PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement in support of the health care reform process calling for the government to finally \fix\ the nations health care cost problems. While many elements of the $2 trillion cost cutting pledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they could ultimately win out and defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House: The first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMAs top executives, including Tauzin, and industry CEOs met with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available schedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee chairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20. In a press release featuring a statement by Tauzin, Baucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80 billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the Senate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news re_gorts, Baucus initially proposed $100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June 2 were able to win the lower figure. The terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the \donut hole\ in Medicare prescription drug coverage. The \donut hole\ is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare prescription drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at $2,700 spent and does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal; 50 percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the \donut hole.\ In Baucus press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, \This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we can make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today.\ This \once-in-a-lifetime\ opportunity also extended to the pharmaceutical industrys ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through Medicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand statement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the White House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table. Baucus proceeded with a_pia,n c.c)r .ivene.a bicartisap rimuo in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White House. These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe. Baucus decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry - which were reliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to meet the White Houses announced iltuouet reces§ dee&rie for passing health care reform. Soon after, PhRMAs big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with Rehm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this meeting). In August, The Huffirytorj. !Dosi,. --; Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that outlined the policies that would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug negotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D and Part B. The deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more. *** While the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their own versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the final product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Commerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the $80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had gotten the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation. Medicare negotiating power and speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures proposed by the committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80 billion cap agreed to by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA. The cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the CEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public with the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Ancg•3les•Firrief- , - :, in an exclusive report, featured quotes from Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and that, as Tauzin put it, \The White House blessed it.\ Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, \For his part, Tauzin said he had not only received the White House pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal Obama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.\ The White Houses Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzins claim, stating, \The president encouraged this approach ... He wanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.\ Democratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijaiva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked, \Are industry groups going to be the ones at the table who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?\ *** On September 7, Baucus bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed $80 billion. Five days later, the New York :limes reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an advertising blitz in support of Baucus bill. The Times noted that the ad spending \...would be a follow-up to the deal that drug makers struck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House.\ On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his les.j .islation to the public. t The White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment targeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest Medicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to push for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the \donut hole\ completely. Nelson claimed that his amendment would onerate $106 billion in revenue, or from PhRMAs perspective increase their cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to the pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted with Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment. It is little surprise the Carpers Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and Menendez New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-Squibb, all of which lobbied for the $80 billion cap. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on Dec. 3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan introduced an amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) released a letter objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: \...as currently written, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there are significant safety concerns.\ Dorgans amendment was defeated with numerous Democrats previously in support of reimportation switching to \no\ votes. On Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact. *** New Years Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill had been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the senator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover. Despite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda, particularly health care reform. in the end, the pharmaceutical industrys support for health care reform would be left up in the air. After spending $100 million in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the pharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut by Tauzin, pushedjauzin to_res ..i .s., his .post. In an interview with Diane Sawvqf., President Obama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform, \[The health care debate as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongst supporters that we just don't know what's going on ... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back room deals.\

Draft S Statement on the Hikers I was pleased to learn of the consular visit yesterday by the Swiss Ambassador in Iran to the three detained American hikers, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd. But we are disturbed by the families reports of their childrens physical and emotional health. These three Americans -- innocent tourists in Iraqs Kurdistan region when they were detained on July 31, 2009 -- have been unjustly held for almost nine months without formal charges or access to legal representation. We ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to release these three Americans and allow them to go home and be reunited with their families. ###

Israeli diplomatic [euphemism for Prime Ministers Office -- DR] sources said: \Clinton isnt relevant and is out of the circle of influence. Mitchell has taken over the peace process to a great extent and Obama, in any event, is the important person in this story because he is the one who decides.\ etanyahu to meet Obama, but not Clinton Eli Bardenstein, Maariv, July 1 2010 [page 7; Hebrew original here and at bottom of post] rime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is to leave next week for Washington, where he will meet with US President Barack Obama. Rather curiously, he is not scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the course of his visit to Washington. Contrary to his previous visit in March, this time the US administration intends to create the impression, outwardly at least, that the severe crisis in the relationship has passed and that the relations between the two countries are as strong as ever. In order to bolster that impression, the two leaders will meet the media together and will be photographed. As opposed to the previous time, Netanyahu will also be put up at Blair House, the official White House guesthouse, and not at a hotel. That said, officials in Washington are waiting apprehensively for the answers that Netanyahu will provide in the course of the meeting, which is expected to address the transition from the proximity talks that are at an impasse to direct negotiations. Obama, apparently, will demand that Netanyahu agree to extend the construction freeze in Judea and Samaria beyond the September 26 expiration date in hope of securing PA Chairman Abu Mazen's consent to begin direct talks with Israel. For the time being, the forum of seven is divided over this issue. Read more of this post

We look forward to continuing to work with all Hondurans and encourage others in the Americas to follow the lead of the Honduran people in helping advance national reconciliation and the implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord. Significant work remains to be done to restore democratic and constitutional order in Honduras, but today the Honduran people took a necessary and important step forward.

C05770985	of Rage 1:1 Days of Rage -- The Noxious Transformation of the Conservative Movement into a Rabid Fringe By Max Blumenthal, Nation Books Posted on August 10, 2010, Printed on August 17, 2010 http://www.alternet.orgistory/147784/ Editor's Note: The following is the new epilogue from Max Blumenthal's book, Republic Gomorrah, now out in paperback (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). \He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself Since the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes? In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility.\ -- Jean-Paul Sartre, \Anti-Semite and Jew\ I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Obama era. It might have been early on, in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada. Perusing tables piled high with high- caliber semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration camps, and a socialist government in Washington. \These people that are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about whats going on in this country,\ a gun dealer told me outside a show in Reno. \Good luck Obama,\ a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. \We outnumber him 100 to 1.\ At this time, the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national medias radar. In September 2009, I led a panel discussion about this book inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty at the University of California- Riverside. Beside me sat Jonathan Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate and local community college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen College Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a \left-wing hack\ while a hysterical young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a \racist.\ Afterward, university police officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he shouted threats. Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order. My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimize President Obama and his allies in Congress. The Rights days of rage were only beginning. Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against partisanship, declaring that there were \no red states\ and no \conservative America.\ Apparently, he thought it was merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonized gays, assailed minority and womens rights -- or that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Reagan and the Right and their strategies of polarization was not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain \divisive\ personalities, easily wiped away with gestures toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but separated by \partisans.\ The skilled and devoted community organizer could bring them together. Many of his supporters in the media, often part and parcel of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could \bridge• the partisan divide.\ Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected conservative who once called critics of George W. Bush policies \fifth columnists\ but now fervently supporting Obama, wrote that the new president was destined to become \a liberal Reagan who can reunite America.\ This optimism pervaded the Obama White House as the president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programs. After all, why couldnt we all just get along? In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: \I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.\ Once he was elected, conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obamas strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most fearsome images they could conjure. Obamas multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock troops. Those who rejected Obamas legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the \Birther\ movement that sought to challenge his citizenship. The movements most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self- trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right Web site WorldNetDaily that Obama planned to create a \civilian national security force,\ Taitz told me she \realized that Obama was another Stalin--its a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitlers Germany.\ After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obamas family had forged his birth certificate in Hawaii, Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California Secretary of State Debra Bowen demanding an investigation into Obamas eligibility to serve as president. Taitzs plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an Orange County radio preacher and former second vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly prayed for Obamas death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges, Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers from Sean Haimity to CNNs Lou Dobbs, who Taitz called her \greatest supporter\ and who was eventually fired as an indirect result of his hosting of her. In March 2009, Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice in goverment and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28 percent of Republican respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasnt born in the United States, while 30 percent \werent sure.\ \Obama should be in the Big House,\ Taitz shrieked to me, \not the White House!\ When Obama announced health care reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement activated a campaign of demonization -- transformational politics -- designed to turn Obama into the \Other,\ making him seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a health care reform bill in 2009, the Right staged a living theater of political hatred, Obama's dream of bipartisanship transformed into a nightmarish version of \Marat/Sade.\ On September 12, 2009, tens of thousands of far-right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama health care plan. The date was significant: Fox News's top- ranked talk show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the \9-12 Project\ to restore the sense of unity -- and siege mentality -- that Americans experienced on September 11, 2001. But this time, Obama -- not Osama -- was the enemy. While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al- Qaida; demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden; others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a U.S. citizen. \We can fight al-Qaida, we cant kill Obama,\ said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, \Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world,\ pointing to placards he had fashioned depicting Obama and House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to another activist, Obamas agenda was similar to Hitlers: \Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had his own personal secret service police. [The community- organizing group] ACORN is an extension of that.\ The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid the provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence. Members of the Tea Party \Patriots\ did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed ACORN helped Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea Partys primary concern was cultural purification -- freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always transparent. The Tea Partys strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported health care reform. The Tea Partiers were convinced this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side -- that they represented the \Real America.\ At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organizers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance, something ABC denied, saying \ABCNews.com reported an approximate figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters.\ Then Armey led the crowd in a chant of \Freedom works! Freedom works!\ Unknown to most of the Tea Partiers, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy group, not the battle cry of Mel Gibson William Wallace in Braveheart. Contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilized to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties. The movements leading puppet-master was Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking points to the Tea Party \Patriots\ from his Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armeys lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating health care reform. (Armeys other \real American\ clients included the Marxist terror cult, Peoples Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants. If Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah PalM was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after Obamas inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honor. PalMs motives for quitting became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality show on cable television, \Sarah Palin's Alaska.\ PalMs book tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential campaign and a traveling carnival. Whether or not PalM intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos desperately seeking to expand the partys base after the drubbing in 2008. Former McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt warned that Palins nomination in 2012 would be \catastrophic\ for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an October Gallup poll revealing her as one of the most polarizing and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50 percent. Unfortunately for Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff. A November 2009 special congressional election in New Yorks heavily Republican 23rd district was the first major test of Palins power. Along with a parade of nationally recognized conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown far- right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party, helping to force a popular moderate Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palins ideological purge in upstate New York led to an improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Rep. Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentuckys GOP senatorial primary, while Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rands regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state. Following the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian Right within the movements ranks, the self-described \hardcore pro- lifer\ Palin recast herself as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of \economic freedom.\ She claimed the Democratic \cap and trade\ plan to limit carbon emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed health care reform as a Trojan Horse for \socialism\ (though she admitted her family \used to hustle over the border\ to take advantage of Canadas single-payer health care system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama health care plan included a provision for \death panels\ that would recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin transformed the tone of the health care debate from rancorous to poisonous. The source of Palins \death panels\ smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey. When President Bill Clinton introduced health care reform during his first term, McCaughey falsely claimed in an article published in the New Republic and widely circulated by Republicans, that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into the governments program (the article would go on to win a National Magazine Award and then be retracted years later by the New Republics editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a rumor that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking Web site Politifact.com as \the lie of 2009.\ McCaugheys latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilized to push the rumor into the mainstream. In June 2009, one of LaRouches top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Healths chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitlers T- 4 program to kill the handicapped through health care reform. \President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there,\ LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged. Soon, LaRouches followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a Hitler moustache. At a town hall forum on health care reform hosted by Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, a LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded, \Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?\ Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumor on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate Finance Committee member Charles Grassley parroted her claims before audiences of indignant Tea Partiers. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death panels. Echoing the LaRouche cultists, Beck accused Ezekiel Emanuel of \the devaluing of human life, putting a price on each individual.\ He thundered, \The death panel is not a firing squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!\ The death panel rumor served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican Party. Most importantly, the rumor resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the federal government and Christian Right activists who viewed the legalization of abortion as a slippery slope to government-sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005, when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death. The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neoconservatives back into the fray. The new neo- con generation was led by Dick Cheneys daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro- Israel sources. Asked by CNNs Larry King about the Birther movement that was challenging Obamas status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked, \One of the reasons you see people so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so reluctant to defend the nation overseas.\ With the libertarians, Christian Right, and the neo-cons seated around the same table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again. The experiments in \Terror Management Theory\ of Sheldon Solomon, professor of psychology at Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg, professor of psychologist at the Unviersity of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski, professor of psychology at the University of Colorado, have demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain the effectiveness of the death panel rumor and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not Independents responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance. Obamas first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a SWAT team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawskis best friend told reporters the young killer \grew angry recently over fears Obama would outlaw guns.\ Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video clip to a neo-Nazi Web site portraying Foxs Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration camps. (After a characteristically thorough investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti- abortion group Operation Rescue, shot Dr. George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by the anti- abortion movement because of his role as Kansass only late-term abortion provider. During at least 28 episodes of Bill OReillys \OReilly Factor,\ O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as \Tiller the baby killer,\ a criminal guilty of \Nazi stuff.\ \I wouldnt want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day,\ OReilly proclaimed. In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and gunned down three women. The mainstream press explained Sodinis motives away by homing in on passages in his online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic masturbation. Nearly every major media outlet omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation. The day after Obamas election victory, Sodini wrote: \Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].\ In another posting to an anti- Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans Whitewater investigation, Sodini revealed that he had purchased a bumper sticker reading, \Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,\ from a National Review ad. A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site, \I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I dont think any group of political leaders will achieve this for us.\ Whether or not Sodini's murder spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed, \Death lives!\ More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonization and conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party \Patriots.\ During a broadcast of \Fox and Friends,\ Beck opined that Obama \has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white culture.\ As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African American former community organizer who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to ACORN while upholding her and Jones as evidence of Obama's \socialist\ agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African Americans referring to \Obama money\ as they collected welfare checks in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that \Obamas SS\ was being trained across inner- city America. In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted ACORN, the Rights new favorite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to use the poor peoples advocacy group to distract his viewers from the health care debate. \Trust me,\ Beck said, \Everybody now says theyre going to be talking about health care. I dont think so.\ (His statement was reminiscent of Rush Limbaughs scandal- mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: \Whitewater is about health care.\) Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James OKeefe and Hannah Giles inside ACORN field offices. In the videos, OKeefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. OKeefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with ACORN; however, Giles later admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to farther ineriminate ACORN. In the end. ACORN was exonerated of all criminal wrongdoing while in a separate incident OKeefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone lines in the office of Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, OKeefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded conservative outfits; OKeefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth Froup that nurtured leadinG, lights like Jack Abriunoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon. While OKeefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned the hithest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like OReilly and Sean Hannity. In the process. Becks opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. \Glenn Beck has taught us everything we know,\ a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told Me. \He's opened our eyes to so much.\ But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gin<trichs Republican counter-revolution of 1994, Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves, Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in hopes of becoming the next Howard Stem. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. \We remember Glenn from the womanizing, the drinking, the drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a: complete mess he was,\ a shock jock from Tampa, Florida, who called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show. Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo- populist demagogue of Elia Kazans 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd. Beck was a self- destructive drifter Who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away in ,a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilize his life when he made his escape from freedom., marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into conservative radio diatribes. When Beck first broke into television On CNNs Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political world view. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative .hosts in any way, he did so through strained and often snide attempts at humor, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent, Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W. Clean Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar. Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures. Thanks to Becks designation of Skousens pseudohistorical tract The 5000 Year Leap as \required reading\ on the Web site of his 9- 12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen. became the Hidden imam of the Tea Party movement. By the summer of 2009, Skousens Leap was among the top 10 books on Amazon.com and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified, to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. in the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation is un-American, that \coercive taxation\ is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin Franklin., who wrote at length on the merits of \amours\ with \old women,\ and who famously solicited prostitutes and fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage. Though Skousen claims the Founders as the worlds foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodds screeds about the Illuminati. According. to Skousen, Dodd claimed that \powerful influences congregating in the United States\ like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United States into World War I. Skousen published Dodds manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemens Digest, which he founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies. Skousens paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation. in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview. Skousens son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumors of Hoovers cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.) Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake Citys police chief for, in the words of the citys conservative Mormon mayor, \conduct[ing] hi.s office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.\ From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the Right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist-, and earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of \promoting [his] own anti-communism for obvious financial purposes.\ Skousens vocal support for the far-right John Birch Societys claim that communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil rights. movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter Day Saints distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Journalist Alexander Zaitchik observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon.com that Skousens renewed influence through Beck and the Tea Party suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.\ Besides influencing Beck, Skousens teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movements most visible grassroots celebrities, retired Sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far- right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama. On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the Constitution. Mack urged his spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. \If you control the food supply,\ Mack warned, \you control the people. And thats the first step to slavery.\ Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal background checks of gun purchasers, Mack reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government. Along with a few dozen former and active military and law enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanized by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration camps. Because the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance. Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid- 1990s entitled Strategy and Tactics for a Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on \war criminals, secret policemen, rats.\ With Obama in office, Vandeboegh churned out anti- government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month. For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the greatest threat to the passage of health care reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since 1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When health care reform was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women. But after close consultation with leaders of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in health care negotiations. 'He's a big hero now in the pro-life community,\ former Bush Catholic issues adviser Deal Hudson told me in November 2009. \Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats having any power.\ To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to Hudson, the Catholic Bishops were keen to see health care reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March, after pressure from House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Obam.a agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he and his anti- abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports seeped out declaring the imminent passage of health care reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr. George Tiller: \Bart the Baby-Killer.\ On March 20, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitols Longworth Building in expectation of Obamas pep talk to the House Democrats and the health care vote. Democratic Representative john Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the crowd on their way inside the Capitol. Thsligger!\ a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a \faggot,\ eliciting laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face. With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of \Kill the bill! drifted into calls for violence. \I would gladly stand with any of you men here and take these fascists down,\ a man in camouflage battle dress uniform proclaimed in front of an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. \You haven't heard the last of me!\ The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Partiers. The demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over. Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupaks original amendment, demanded a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. \The motion to commit does not support life,\ Stupak declared. \It is the Democrats who have stood up....\ Heckling from the Republican side interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Rep. Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, \Baby killer!\ Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults. While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a right-wing Kristallnacht. \If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows,\ Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. \Break them NOW. Break them and run to break again.\ Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and Arizona had been shattered. Meanwhile, at least 10 Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of health care reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder. The brother of Representative Torn Perriello, another health care supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged after a local Tea Party organizer posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressmans) and encouraged activists to \drop by\ to express their anger about Perriellos recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffbrds office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the window of Representative Louise Slaughters office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper attacks. After the Passage of the health care bill, the Tea Party floated into a gray zone between authoritarianism and anarchy. Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle cry: \Dont Retreat, Instead—RELOAD!\ Thus concluded the first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.

C05767474	EU leaders to debate Blair presidency on summit sidelines Climate talks overshadowed by divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president European government chiefs gather in Brussels this evening for a summit likely to be the first occasion to broach the divisive subject of Tony Blair's candidacy to be Europe's first president. The topic is not formally on the agenda of a meeting that will be dominated by wrangling over climate change funding and how to get the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, to add the final signature to the reformist Lisbon treaty. But senior diplomats predicted there would be intense private discussion on the fringes of the summit over the question: who will get the plum job of first sitting president of the European council, the pre-eminent EU forum that brings leaders together for summits at least four times a year. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that Blair would give Europe a \strong voice\ on the global stage, but his comments were seized on by his Conservative shadow, William Hague, who said the debate over the presidency proved that the UK should have held a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Officially, the job does not exist until Klaus finalises Czech ratification of the treaty, expected within weeks. While Blair personally has kept quiet about his ambitions, the British government is campaigning increasingly assertively on the former prime minister's behalf. \We will be making the case for a strong, internationally known figure who can open doors in [foreign] capitals,\ said an official. \There is only one candidate.\ That was not a reference to Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister and European fixer, who is the only contender so far to have openly declared his candidacy. He emerged this week as the anti-Blair. Juncker looks certain to fail in his bid for the top job. But he may well succeed in destroying Blair's chances, being viewed as a stalking horse who will vanish to make way for a third unknown contender. While the Blair debate rages on the sidelines of the summit, the big priority for the Swedish government chairing the meeting is to try to break a deadlock on EU funding of climate change programmes in the developing world ahead of the Copenhagen conference in December. Berlin and Warsaw are the keys to a deal, but the prospects for a breakthrough look dim. Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, warned that Europe's credibility on global warming was at stake. In recent weeks European governments have locked horns over the financing package and have been unable to reach agreement. The aim is to come up with pledges of an EU fund of up to €15bn (£13.4bn) a year by 2020 for transfers to the developing countries to combat global warming. The overall package is central to a Copenhagen deal. But with the other big players, especially the US, which is reluctant to commit to a figure, Germany believes Europe should not show its hand until the Copenhagen negotiations. The European commission and others such as the UK and the Scandinavians believe agreeing on a figure in advance would strengthen Europe's global leadership role on climate change and send a strong signal to other potential signatories. The Poles and other eastern Europeans are unhappy at being asked to stump up for developing countries such as Brazil, which is wealthier than the poorer EU members. The Poles are refusing to agree a package and figures for Copenhagen unless it is first decided how the bill will be split among the EU's 27 governments. In the midst of a financial crisis, the eastern Europeans say they cannot afford the climate change fund. Angela Merkel, sworn in yesterday for a second term as German chancellor, will be pivotal to any climate change financing deal and her answer to the Blair question may also be decisive. So far, she has been hedging her bets. While Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, is known to support Blair with reservations, there are no German candidates for the two big new jobs being created under Lisbon — the European president and a European foreign minister or high representative for foreign and security policy. In Paris last night the French and German leaders discussed the posts, although there was little information on whether they reached a pact. Sarkozy said the two leaders agreed on \almost everything\. Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — all said to nurse ambitions to secure the presidential post themselves — have come out publicly against Blair on the grounds that he would neglect the interests of smaller EU member states — 19 out of the total 27. Adding his voice to the argument, Demitris Christofias, the president of Cyprus, said a council president \from a small country would be more objective and more consensual. The European Union is a family of compromises.\ The Dutch centre-right prime minister and possible contender, Jan-Peter Balkenende, has come under pressure this week to renounce European presidential ambitions since his move to Brussels could trigger early elections and the fall of his government. Christofias emphasised that tonight the priority would be to get the Klaus blocking of the Lisbon treaty lifted rather than focusing on who gets what under Lisbon. Senior diplomats agreed it was too early to discuss names. If Klaus signs thetreaty soon, a special summit would be convened next month to decide on the president and foreign minister, also leaving the European commission chief, Jose Manuel Barroso, to put together a new team.

C05774160	sbwhoeop Friday, October 22, 2010 6:18 PM H: Iran hikers info. Sid Just now the NYT is reporting what I assume you already know, that the US hikers held prisoner in Iran were grabbed in Iraq. I also assume that you saw the report last June that they were seized by a Revolutionary Guard officer now held for drug running and murder. It seems that the hikers were too close to a drug trail. I will send you memos on latest political intel and policy ideas for Europe in next few days. Sid US Hikers Were Seized in Iraq By Babak Sarfaraz Posted on June 24, 2010, Printed on October 22, 2010 http://www.theinvestigativefund.org/investigations/internationa1/1338/ KURDISTAN PROVINCE, IRAN— Since their arrest last July by Iranian forces near the Iraq border, three Americans — Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd — have been at the center of a high-stakes diplomatic struggle between Tehran and Washington. Iranian authorities have repeatedly accused the three of entering Iran to conduct espionage. Meanwhile, friends and family of the three, along with the State Department, the Committee to Protect Journalists, The Nation and The Investigative Fund [Bauer has written Investigative Fund stories that appeared in The Nation and Mother Jones], have rejected the spying charge and suggested that the Americans accidentally crossed the border while on a recreational hike. Despite a well- publicized visit by the detainees' mothers in May, Iran has released little information about the circumstances of their arrest or the status of their case. The Nation and The Investigative Fund have located two witnesses to the arrest who claim that Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were on Iraqi territory when they were arrested — not in Iran, as Iranian officials have asserted. Two additional sources report that the Revolutionary Guards officer who likely ordered their detention has since been arrested on charges of smuggling, kidnapping and murder. The witnesses are residents of a Kurdish village in Iraq called Zalem, which lies a few miles from the Iran border; they declined to be identified, fearing retaliation from Iranian forces, who have been known to conduct missions across the border. The witnesses separately reported noticing the three Americans as they hiked up a mountain in the scenic Khormal region, which straddles the border. Part of the mountain lies in Iraq and part in Iran, but except for a few watchtowers and occasional signposts, the border here is largely unmarked, although local residents are familiar with its boundaries. The witnesses, who followed the Western-looking hikers out of curiosity, say that around 2 pm on July 31, as the hikers descended the mountain, uniformed guards from NAJA, Iran's national police force, waved the hikers toward the Iranian side using \threatening\ and \menacing\ gestures. When their calls were ignored, one officer fired a round into the air. As the hikers continued to hesitate, the guards walked a few yards into Iraqi territory, where they lack jurisdiction, and apprehended them. These witness accounts corroborate a statement Bauer made on May 20 during a tele-vised reunion at a Tehran hotel between the hikers and their mothers. As the New York Times reported, Bauer \denied that they had walked into Iran, as they were accused of doing, before stopping himself and saying, We cant really talk about that.\ Farhad Lohoni, a local tribal leader, had previously claimed that the American hikers had been snatched from Iraq in a cross-border raid by Iranian agents, as reported in the Daily Telegraph in August 2009. Lohoni said that his relatives had seen a group of men cross the border into Iraq, and he told the Telegraph that the hikers \were targeted and captured by a group that came over from Iran, ignoring Iraqs sovereignty. We know this and it means that Iran must have wanted to take Americans hostage at this sensitive time.\ A State Department spokesman said that he had been unaware of evidence that the three were arrested in Iraqi territory but would not comment further. Once captured, Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were sped by car to the local headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Marivan, a town close to the border in the province of Kurdistan. When they arrived, according to two sources, the Americans were remanded into the custody of Lt. Col. Heyva Taab, then head of the Revolutionary Guards intelligence unit in the region. According to these sources — a former member of the Revolutionary Guards and an official who serves in the provincial government at Sanandaj — only Taab would have had the authority to order the Americans detention and eventual transfer to Tehran. A branch of the Iranian military with at least 125,000 personnel, the Revolutionary Guards are responsible for maintaining national security throughout the Islamic Republic. \When I heard the news that they had arrested American hikers, I immediately thought, This is the work of the intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guards, because they have people in this region,\ says Idris Ahmedi, an Iranian Kurdish exile and a regional expert who is a visiting scholar at Georgetown University. \I thought they were most likely lured into Iranian Kurdistan, where they could arrest them. It is consistent with Irans past actions.\ Less than a month later, in late August 2009, Taab himself was arrested and charged with the July 6 murder of the son of Mostafa Shirzadi, the Imam Joma (Friday prayer leader) of Marivan, an influential cleric in the region. Shirzadi's nephew was also allegedly killed by Taab. Since his arrest Taab has been implicated in a vast criminal enterprise encompassing a profitable smuggling operation and dozens of murders, rapes and kidnappings. According to the Sanandaj official, numerous lawsuits, perhaps hundreds, have been filed against Taab in Kurdistan, alleging libel, theft, rape, kidnapping and murder. Taab's case has twice been before a judge, and he awaits execution in a Tehran prison. Although the state-run Iranian press has not reported on Taab's crimes, they were made public in a series of articles in January and February by a Kurdish news site, Kurdistan Va Kurdnews, run by the Kurdistan Democratic Party. A February 17 article describes Taab as the head of a \criminal band\ and reports that Taab and seven accomplices were under arrest by the Revolutionary Guards for their role in a vast number of illegal killings. Several sources describe Taab as the central power in Kurdistan province. According to locals and experts, control of the border lies in the hands of the Revolutionary Guards, in particular their intelligence unit, Etelaat Sepah, whose local division had been commanded by Taab for about five years. \At this point its really the Sepah, the Revolutionary Guards, that are in charge, especially in the western provinces, especially because the Americans are on the other side, in Iraq,\ says Kaveh Ehsani, an assistant professor of international studies at DePaul University and an Iran expert who serves as a contributing editor to the journal Middle East Report. \On the surface the security force [NAJA] is in charge, but it really is the Revolutionary Guards that control the borders.\ It is a region where, according to several Iran experts, smuggling and cross-border traffic are routine. The Iraq-Iran border is \relatively porous because its mountainous,\ says Faraz Sanei, an Iran researcher at Human Rights Watch, which issued a report last year on political freedom in Iranian Kurdistan. Sanei describes the border as a common escape route for dissidents —journalists, human rights advocates and Iranian Kurds—as well as a commonly used trade route for goods. \Smuggling is something that has taken place and continues to take place there, whether it be of goods or of humans across the border. Its something that happens quite often.\ Soon after Taab took charge of the Sepah in the northwestern quadrant of Kurdistan, he began to enrich himself off the black-market border economy. According to the Sanandaj official and the former Revolutionary Guards officer, who had firsthand knowledge of Taabs activities, Taabs first scheme involved selling merchandise confiscated from petty smugglers, known as koolbars, who traffic consumer goods across the border (a trade depicted in the Iranian film A Time for Drunken Horses, which won the Camera dOr at Cannes in 2000). The region is also home to a variety of Kurdish nationalist groups that have been demanding autonomy from the central Tehran government. One of these, the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan (PJAK), is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party, a Kurdish separatist organization that engages in armed conflict within Turkey and has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States and other governments. Since 2005 PJAK, based in the mountains in Kurdish Iraq, has been in open conflict with Tehran and has claimed responsibility for killing dozens of Revolutionary Guards soldiers in cross-border raids on Iranian military bases, as well as for the February 2007 downing of an Iranian military helicopter by a shoulder-launched missile in Khoy, in Western Azerbaijan province, which killed thirteen Iranian soldiers. It has been speculated that some of these Kurdish militants enjoy US support. In April 2006, Representative Dennis Kucinich wrote a letter to President Bush questioning whether the US government was \fomenting opposition and supporting military operations in Iran among insurgent groups and Iranian ethnic minority groups, some of whom are operating from Iraq.\ Kucinich named two groups, including PJAK. In November of that year, Seymour Hersh reported in The New Yorker that \Israel and the United States have also been working together in support of a Kurdish resistance group known as the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan,\ and that a government consultant told him that the Israeli government had provided \equipment and training\ to PJAK. The United States and Israel have denied any involvement with PJAK. Still, these allegations of support have gained substantial traction inside Iran and may have undergirded Taabs decision to detain Bauer, Fattal and Shourd as well as the repeated public charges of espionage against the three. In early April, for instance, Iranian Intelligence Minister Heydar Moslehi told Irans Press TV that \it is quite obvious to us that the three Americans arrested in Iran last year had links with Western and Israeli intelligence services.\ The Iranian government has retaliated against rising Kurdish militancy by launching a counteroffensive on PJAK, inside Iran and across the border in Iraq. In August 2007, for example, Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraq and attacked several villages, McClatchy reported. Most recently, on June 4, officials in Iraqs semiautonomous Kurdish region alleged that \a small unit of Iranian soldiers,\ including a tank and several other vehicles, had penetrated more than a mile into Iraqi Kurdistans Arbil province in search of Kurdish rebels. Until his arrest, Taab was a key player in Irans counter- offensive. The former Revolutionary Guards officer says that several current members of the Guards told him that Taabs stated goal was to \completely wipe out PJAK\ in his jurisdiction. According to Alunedi, the scholar at Georgetown, Taab was involved in recent cross-border assassinations of Iranian Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdish weekly Awena reported that Taab and his unit assassinated two Kurds on December 15, 2008. According to the former officer and the Sanandaj official, Taabs criminal enterprise grew beyond smuggling in 2007, when he made his first forays into murder. Koolbars, the petty border smugglers, are often killed by land mines or fatally shot by border police. So Taab concocted a scheme to kidnap koolbars as well as ordinary unemployed Iranian Kurdish civilians, dress them in the uniforms of PJAK insurgents and then kill them—claiming theyd died in a military clash—in order to collect a bounty, as high as $40,000 a head, from his superiors in the Revolutionary Guards. He was assisted in this plot by at least nine others, seven of whom have been apprehended. The article in Kurdistan Va Kurdnews named all seven, including Haji Majid Muqimiyan of Kermansha, identified as a ringleader. PJAK has officially denied involvement in these border clashes, including in a May 3, 2009, post to the Iranian website Tabnak, which is published by Mohsen Rezai, a former head of the Revolutionary Guards. Many of the PJAK clashes may, in fact, have been \bogus,\ said the Sanandaj official. \More or less no clashes with PJAK have been reported in the area since Heyva Taab and his gang were busted.\ A mother of one koolbar tearfully described her sons disappearance. She said he went missing the same day in early 2009 that the government later claimed a clash with PJAK had taken place. The woman, a resident of a border town in Iranian Kurdistan, is a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits against Taab; she asked that her name and location not be mentioned, for fear that it would harm her case in court. Taabs scheme was wildly successful, according to the Sanandaj official, who said one bank account under Taabs name has had nearly $6 million deposited in it since 2008. This macabre scheme ended only in the spring of 2009, when Taab killed a local officials brother who was seeking work in the area and, more decisively, last July when he killed the clerics son. On June 11 Mohammad Javad Larijani, secretary general of Irans High Council for Human Rights, said that the governments investigation was nearly complete and a trial for Bauer, Fattal and Shourd \should not be very far from now.\ In a statement issued on June 17, the mothers of the hikers called on Iran either to prosecute or release their children. \Iran has no legitimate reason at this stage not to release them or move forward with a fair trial in which our children can openly answer any allegations against them.\ \These new revelations, if indeed true, show the hikers have been victims of political machinations and manipulation,\ said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. \The fact that they have been held for so long without prosecution strongly supports this trend. Under Iranian laws, they have committed no crime and should be released immediately. Their Iranian lawyer, who has studied the judicial files against them, has consistently maintained the only charge against them is illegal entry, which is subject to a fine and not arbitrary detention for so long. With this new information, even that charge appears fabricated, and there is no basis for holding them.\ As of the press date, Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd have been detained by Iran for ten months and twenty-three days.

GORDON and ANDREW W. LEHREN Iran has accused three American hikers of illegally crossing into Iranian territory in July 2009 and is still holding two of them in prison. But a classified American military report made public by WikiLeaks, which describes the chaotic day when the hikers were detained, asserts that the hikers were on the Iraqi side of the border when they were seized. The initial reports of any incident are not always correct. But one American government official who served in Iraq said that the field report was generally consistent with what he had been told by Iraqi officials — namely, that the hikers were close to the border but on the Iraqi side. The episode began when four Americans traveled from Syria to northern Iraq, planning to hike up the Ahmed Awa, a mountainous area with a dramatic waterfall. One American, Shon Meckfessel, became ill and stayed behind when his friends — Shane M. Bauer, Joshua F. Fattal and Sarah E. Shourd — set out on July 31. A July 31 field report states that Mr. Meckfessel learned of the arrests when a \female called him saying they were being surrounded by armed men.\ At first, the American military did not know who was holding the Americans. An intelligence officer at the American Army division based in northern Iraq, the report notes, initially described the event as a \kidnapping\ and said the three American tourists \were being taken to the Iranian border.\ The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained — all on the Iraqi side of the border. As documented in the report, the frenetic effort to locate the American hikers and to inter-view Mr: Meckfessel appeared to support the claim that they were tourists and not American intelligence operatives, as Iran has alleged. A drone aircraft was sent to look for the missing Americans, and two F-16s jet fighters were alerted. American Special Operations forces were sent to pick up Mr. Meckfessel, so he could be taken to Baghdad for questioning. As the day wore on, the Americans received a report from an officer with the pesh merga, the Kurdish military force in northern Iraq, that the Iranians had detained three American citizens \for being too close to the border.\ The July report reflects some frustration with the hikers for their \lack of coordination\ in venturing to northern Iraq and offers some thoughts on the episodes broader implications. \The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension,\ it notes.

C05767994	March 15, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Taking On China By PAUL KRUGMAN Tensions are rising over Chinese economic policy, and rightly so: Chinas policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi, undervalued has become a significant drag on global economic recovery. Something must be done. To give you a sense of the problem: Widespread complaints that China was manipulating its currency — selling renminbi and buying foreign currencies, so as to keep the renminbi weak and Chinas exports artificially competitive — began around 2003. At that point China was adding about $10 billion a month to its reserves, and in 2003 it ran an overall surplus on its current account — a broad measure of the trade balance — of $46 billion. Today, China is adding more than $30 billion a month to its $2.4 trillion hoard of reserves. The International Monetary Fund expects China to have a 2010 current surplus of more than $450 billion — 10 times the 2003 figure. This is the most distortionary exchange rate policy any major nation has ever followed. And its a policy that seriously damages the rest of the world. Most of the worlds large economies are stuck in a liquidity trap — deeply depressed, but unable to generate a recovery by cutting interest rates because the relevant rates are already near zero. China, by engineering an unwarranted trade surplus, is in effect imposing an anti-stimulus on these economies, which they cant offset. So how should we respond? First of all, the U.S. Treasury Department must stop fudging and obfuscating. Twice a year, by law, Treasury must issue a report identifying nations that \manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade.\ The laws intent is clear: the report should be a factual determination, not a policy statement. In practice, however, Treasury has been both unwilling to take action on the renminbi and unwilling to do what the law requires, namely explain to Congress why it isnt taking action. Instead, it has spent the past six or seven years pretending not to see the obvious. Will the next report, due April 15, continue this tradition? Stay tuned. If Treasury does find Chinese currency manipulation, then what? Here, we have to get past a common misunderstanding: the view that the Chinese have us over a barrel, because we dont dare provoke China into dumping its dollar assets. What you have to ask is, What would happen if China tried to sell a large share of its U.S. assets? Would interest rates soar? Short-term U.S. interest rates wouldnt change: theyre being kept near zero by the Fed, which wont raise rates until the unemployment rate comes down. Long-term rates might rise slightly, but theyre mainly determined by market expectations of future short-term rates. Also, the Fed could offset any interest-rate impact of a Chinese pullback by expanding its own purchases of long-term bonds. Its true that if China dumped its U.S. assets the value of the dollar would fall against other major currencies, such as the euro. But that would be a good thing for the United States, since it would make our goods more competitive and reduce our trade deficit. On the other hand, it would be a bad thing for China, which would suffer large losses on its dollar holdings. In short, right now America has China over a barrel, not the other way around. So we have no reason to fear China. But what should we do? Some still argue that we must reason gently with China, not confront it. But weve been reasoning with China for years, as its surplus ballooned, and gotten nowhere: on Sunday Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, declared — absurdly — that his nations currency is not undervalued. (The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that the renminbi is undervalued by between 20 and 40 percent.) And Mr. Wen accused other nations of doing what China actually does, seeking to weaken their currencies \just for the purposes of increasing their own exports.\ But if sweet reason wont work, whats the alternative? In 1971 the United States dealt with a similar but much less severe problem of foreign undervaluation by imposing a temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports, which was removed a few months later after Germany, Japan and other nations raised the dollar value of their currencies. At this point, its hard to see China changing its policies unless faced with the threat of similar action — except that this time the surcharge would have to be much larger, say 25 percent. I dont propose this turn to policy hardball lightly. But Chinese currency policy is adding materially to the worlds economic problems at a time when those problems are already very severe. Its time to take a stand.

C05772716	Declan, Thanks for your email. Of course its not personal. But I do think its wrong. When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in respective Governments. In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didnt mean I invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly. Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been invited to attend the Conference in any capacity. That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and admiration for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their spokesmen when they were in Opposition. The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next weeks Conference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen on which to determine his priorities. You would not expect me to comment on his decision. However, I dont have to rehearse with you that successful long-term economic investment in Northern Ireland will require building not only a stable peace process, but continuing to build cross-party and cross-community consensus. I am sorry we have not been invited to help. The current coalition Government in Britain will not always be in power and it may not even last the course. It seems regrettable that in such a challenging global economic environment that those of us who helped build the peace are not even invited to continue helping. Best, Shaun

C05767482	sbwhoeor Sunday, November 29, 2009 1:0S PM H Re: Another memo on backdrop to this week. Sid November 28, 2009 Editorial Diplomacy 101 We were thrilled when President Obama decided to plunge fully into the Middle East peace effort. He appointed a skilled special envoy, George Mitchell, and demanded that Israel freeze settlements, Palestinians crack down on anti-Israel violence and Arab leaders demonstrate their readiness to reach out to Israel. Nine months later, the presidents promising peace initiative has unraveled. The Israelis have refused to stop ail building. The Palestinians say that they wont talk to the Israelis until they do, and President Mahmoud Abbas is so despondent he has threatened to quit. Arab states are refusing to do anything. Mr. Obamas own credibility is so diminished (his approval rating in Israel is 4 percent) that serious negotiations may be farther off than ever. Peacemaking takes strategic skill. But we see no sign that President Obama and Mr. Mitchell were thinking more than one move down the board. The president went public with his demand for a full freeze on settlements before securing Israels commitment. And he and his aides apparently had no plan for what they would do if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no. Most important, they allowed the controversy to obscure the real goal: nudging Israel and the Palestinians into peace talks. (We dont know exactly what happened but we are told that Mr. Obama relied more on the judgment of his political advisers — specifically his chief of staff, Rehm Emanuel -- than of his Mideast specialists.) The idea made sense: have each side do something tangible to prove it was serious about peace and then start negotiations. But when Mr. Netanyahu refused the total freeze, President Obama backed down. Mr. Netanyahu has since offered a compromise 10-month freeze that exempts Jerusalem, schools and synagogues and permits Israel to complete 3,000 housing units already under construction. The irony is that while this offer goes beyond what past Israeli governments accepted, Mr. Obama had called for more. And the Palestinians promptly rejected the compromise. Washington isnt the only one to blow it. After pushing President Obama to lead the peace effort, Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, refused to make any concessions until settlements were halted. Mr. Mitchell was asking them to allow Israel to fly commercial planes through Arab airspace or open a trade office. They have also done far too little to strengthen Mr. Abbas, who is a weak leader but is still the best hope for negotiating a peace deal. Ditto for Washington and Israel. All this raises two questions: What has President Obama learned from the experience so he can improve his diplomatic performance generally? And does he plan to revive the peace talks? The president has no choice but to keep trying. At some point extremists will try to provoke another war. and the absence of a dialogue will only make things worse. Advancing his own final-status plan for a two-state solution is one high-risk way forward that we think is worth the gamble. Stalemate is unsustainable.

C05771674	November 23, 2010 Effort for Liberal Balance to G.O.P. Groups Begins By MICHAEL LUO In what may prove a significant development for the 2012 elections, David Brock, a prominent Democratic political operative, says he has amassed $4 million in pledges over the last few weeks and is moving quickly to hire a staff to set up what he hopes will become a permanent liberal counterweight over the airwaves to the Republican-leaning outside groups that spent so heavily on this year's midterm elections. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and the eldest of Robert F. Kennedy's 11 children, has agreed to serve as the chairwoman of the group, which will be called American Bridge, lending to the still extremely nascent undertaking the weight of what remains one of the most significant families in Democratic politics. Leading Democratic donors who have already pledged money to the group include Rob McKay, heir to the Taco Bell fortune and chairman of the Democracy Alliance, a partnership of wealthy liberal donors; Robert Dyson, who heads Dyson-Kissner-Moran, a takeover and acquisitions firm in New York City; and Marcia L. Carsey, a television producer who gave $1 million to Democratic outside groups in 2004. Mr. Brock said in an interview that he planned to formally file papers with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday to set up American Bridge as what is known as an independent-expenditure-only political action committee, meaning it will be able to take in contributions of unlimited size from individuals and corporations but must regularly disclose its donors. Certain to set off debate, however, is that Mr. Brock appears to be positioning his new organization so that fund-raising consultants can raise money for Democratic-oriented media efforts not just through American Bridge but also via one of the nonprofit organizations Mr. Brock currently runs, Media Matters Action Network, which does not disclose its donors. The action network, which tracks conservative politicians and advocacy organizations, is organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit group and is set to take on an expanded role in the 2012 elections, including potentially running television ads, according to an internal draft concept paper about American Bridge's and Media Matter Action Network's plans obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Brock said that \money is money,\ and that he would actively solicit donors for both entities and, in the end, the media spending would be apportioned accordingly. The moves by Mr. Brock in recent weeks make his the most concrete effort so far on the part of Democratic activists to establish some kind of centralized structure that they hope will become the left's answer in 2012 to such groups on the right as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Crossroads and others, which significantly outspent Democratic- leaning outside groups this year. It is too early to say whether Mr. Brock's group will emerge as the go-to vehicle for giant contributions on the left. Mr. Brock led a much-heralded independent group in the 2008 presidential election that failed to gain much traction after the Obama campaign indicated that it preferred that donors not give to such groups. But Mr. Brock, a former conservative journalist who publicly disavowed the right in the late 1990s, is a respected political player, who has drawn plaudits from liberal donors for his running of the array of groups under the Media Matters umbrella. Mr. Brock pointed out that the various groups associated with Media Matters had raised a combined $23 million this year. Its backers include major Democratic donors like George Soros, the billionaire who recently announced he had given $1 million to the group; Peter B. Lewis, the billionaire chairman of Progressive Insurance, who, like Mr. Soros, gave more than $20 million to Democratic-oriented groups in 2004; and the Hollywood producer Steve Bing. \My donor base already constitutes the major individual players who have historically given hundreds of millions of dollars to these types of efforts,\ Mr. Brock said. \They just need to be asked, and I have no doubt they will step up at this critical time.\ There also seems to be widespread agreement among Democratic activists and donors on the need for such groups to be more heavily involved in the 2012 elections. White House officials have signaled in recent weeks that the Obama administration would not object to Democratic- leaning outside groups getting involved in the 2012 elections, a change from the Obama campaign's attitude toward such groups in 2008. But they have also indicated that they would prefer that the names of donors be disclosed. The lack of disclosure among Republican-leaning outside groups became a central Democratic talking point this year as spending by outside groups on the right exploded before the midterm elections. But the overriding desire on the part of liberal donors and activists to hold on to the White House and to win back some of what was lost in the House and Senate may trump those principles. Most political operatives agree that it is easier to raise money if the option of offering anonymity is available. \It would be sort of a funny principle to stand on, to essentially tie one hand behind your back,\ Mr. McKay said. Besides Mr. Brock, numerous Democratic activists have been in discussions about setting up similar independent efforts. On Monday, for instance, Steve Rosenthal, who was the chief executive of America Coming Together, a Democratic fund- raising vehicle that focused on voter mobilization in the 2004 election, convened a group of political operatives, many of whom were active in that election, at a Washington restaurant to discuss what might be done for 2012. No one, however, has apparently gone as far as Mr. Brock in terms of raising money and formally setting up an organization. Mr. Brock said the $4 million in pledges the group has collected so far should be deposited in its bank account by the end of the first quarter of 2011. By way of comparison, America's Families First Action Fund, one of the major Democratic independent efforts in House races this year, raised just over $4 million for the entire cycle up until mid-October. The internal concept paper for American Bridge lays out a series of priorities for the next year, including initially focusing on attacking vulnerable Republicans in the Senate and the House, as a prelude to major spending in 2012.

C05766222	Politico Poll: Clinton approval soars By: Eamon Javers December 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST A new poll of avid news watchers shows that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a much higher approval rating than the man she once campaigned against and now works for, President Barack Obama. In the poll of 800 registered voters who are self-identified \news watchers,\ Clinton had a 75 percent approval rating and a 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent approval and a 45 percent disapproval rating. The Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has not been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration's agenda, including the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not been subjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama, meanwhile, has been on national television on a daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues. The poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12th, and it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding on Obama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls — in October, for example, a Gallup poll found that Clinton had become more popular than the president. Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clinton's high poll numbers is her high approval among Republicans — numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future, if she chooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats, a healthy 57 percent approval among Republicans, and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular among Democrats — 93 percent — but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell off dramatically, at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively. Clinton's Republican numbers are striking, given how intensely disliked she has been in the past among GOP voters. In fact, part of Obama's appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that he was more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton, who was by then a well-known figure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s. \Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues,\ said Faucheux. \It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration.\ Asked about any future Clinton presidential bid, he said, \Shes in good shape now.\ The next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who notched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63 percent among both Republicans and independents. \Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board,\ said Faucheux. \Everybody else did well among Democrats but fell off among Republicans.\ Another trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in the rest of the country. \These results show that the Beltway echo chamber does not reflect the rest of the country, even among news watchers,\ said Faucheux. Among White House staffers and advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — who is often seen on television — had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had the lowest approval, at 25 percent. Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — who are both closely associated with the economy — both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers disapproval rating was 41 percent. Geithners disapproval rating was 45 percent, one point higher than his approval rating. The poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is often viewed as having sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, at 72 percent, than Republicans, at 13 percent. Among other major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and 41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius both posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod scored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Jones had a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.

C05770839	First observation: Bibis Entebbe in reverse. The father, Benzion Netanyahu, 100 years old, secretary to Jabotinsky, and denounced as too radical by Begin, adored his son Yoni, heroically killed at Entebbe. Benyamin has never measured up. Benzion has constantly criticized him in public for his deviations from the doctrine of Greater Israel. Bibi desperately seeks his fathers approbation and can never equal his dead brother. See Benzions most recent scathing undermining of his son Bibi and Bibis tearful tribute to his brother just last month. The raid on the ship to Gaza resembles the raid on Entebbe, except that there are no hostages, no guns, its not in Africa, and its a fiasco; otherwise, its Entebbe. (Then, theres Ehud Barak reliving his youth as a raider killing Palestinians in Lebanon, a feat memorialized in Spielbergs film, Munich. Ultimately, it didnt work out well that time either. The film captures the moral quandaries, which appear to have escaped the participants.) Further observation: The international press will inquire whether the Obama administration gave a wink or nod as the Bush administration did for the Lebanon and Gaza incursions. Be prepared. Further: Of course, the consequences for US foreign policy and national security are negative across the board: from the analogy of the North Korean ship sinking and the Chinese posture to support for Iranian sanctions, etc., etc. Did the Israelis not hear Petraeuss testimony? Further: Of course, whatever the outcome of such a raid, one of the inevitable ones would be the death of the peace process, such as it is, on the very eve of Bibis scheduled visit to Obama, which would have been, under any circumstance, in light of the raid, profoundly humiliating for the president. Or are the Israelis bone stupid? I dont think so. Cheers, Sid Like Father, Like Son? Netanyahus Father Says Son Not Serious About Two-State Solution. July 8, 2009 1 Comment In a controversial interview with Israels Channel II News, the father of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Professor Benzion Netanyahu, says that his son does not support a Palestinian state. The elder Netanyahu, claims that the prime Minister told him he deliberately placed impossible conditions before the Palestinians. Here are excerpts from the interview. When asked if his son really changed his position concerning a Palestinian state, the 100 year-old historian unequivocally answered: (translation mine) \He does not support. He supports such conditions that they (the Arabs) will never accept it. That is what I heard from him. I didn't propose these conditions, he did. They will never accept these conditions. Not one of them.\ When asked about his own personal opinion about a Palestinian state, the senior Netanyahu stated: Herzl and Nordau (fathers of zionist movement) did not labor to create a Palestinian state. This land is Jewish land and not a land for the Arabs. There is no place here for Arabs, and there wont be a place here for the Arabs. They will never agree to the conditions. Published: 04/18/10, 9:03 AM / Last Update: 04/18/10, 9:21 AM Netanyahu Visits Grave of Brother Who Fell in Entebbe Rescue by Tzvi Ben Gedalyahu Follow Israel news on 4nd On Saturday night, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu visited the grave of his brother Yoni, who fell during the daring rescue of hijacked Israelis in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976. He and his wife Sarah decided to go to the gravesite on Mount Herzl 24 hours before the beginning of Remembrance Day for Fallen Soldiers in order to prevent security tie-ups for thousands of other Israelis who will visit the cemetery Sunday night and Monday. The Netanyahus were moved emotionally after seeing for the first time a commemorative decoration that the IDF carved into the gravestone of Yoni, who led the rescue operation and was the only soldier to die in the maneuver. One of his less known heroic deeds is his saving a soldier from across Syrian lines in the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Sirens will sound throughout Israel for one minute at 8 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) Sunday night to mark the beginning of Memorial Day for 22,682 Fallen Soldiers and 2,431 victims of Arab terrorist attacks following the re-establishment of the State of Israel after 2,000 years. Another 1,500 civilians were killed between 1860 and the 1948 War for Independence, when seven Arab nations attacked the fledging, newly declared state just three years after the Holocaust ended. On Monday morning, a two-minute siren will sound at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). (IsraelNationalNews.com)

C05774852	Senate Republicans Filibuster Fair Pay For Women Matt Finkelstein The first bill President Obama signed after taking office was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to seek justice for pay discrimination. At the time, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME) joined with Democrats to overcome strong Republican opposition to the bill. But today, all three Republican senators voted against a motion to proceed on the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that \would further strengthen current laws against gender-based wage discrimination.\ The motion was defeated by a vote of 58-41, falling two votes short of the 60 needed for the bill to be considered on the Senate floor. This is not the first time the Paycheck Fairness Act has stalled in the Senate. In 2008, the upper chamber failed to vote on the bill after it was approved by the House, which passed the legislation again in 2009 with the support of 10 Republicans. Women earn barely three-quarters of what their male counterparts make for the same work, but conservatives have invented a number of ludicrous reasons for opposing equal pay legislation. For example, the Heritage Foundation has suggested that equal pay laws actually hurt women because businesses simply wont hire them if they are required to pay them fair wages. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has claimed that women would receive better compensation if they just had more \education and training.\

C05767469	Soaring cost of healthcare sets a record By Noam N. Levey February 4, 2010 Los Angeles Times Spending was 17.3% of the economy last year. The share paid by the U.S. will soon exceed 50%, a study says. In a stark reminder of growing costs, the government has released a new estimate that healthcare spending grew to a record 17.3% of the U.S. economy last year, marking the largest one-year jump in its share of the economy since the government started keeping such records half a century ago. The almost $2.5 trillion spent in 2009 was $134 billion more than the previous year, when healthcare consumed 16.2% of the gross domestic product, according to an annual report by independent actuaries at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, scheduled for release Thursday. The nonpartisan accounting agency also projected that as early as next year, the country could mark another milestone as government picks up more than half of the nations total healthcare tab for the first time. The rise in current costs, driven in part by surging spending in Medicare and Medicaid, and the bleak projections for the future do not take into account changes that may come if Democrats revive their healthcare overhaul legislation. The report appears likely to fuel further debate about the health bills now stalled in Congress. In the absence of change, the report raises a grim prospect for the country -- a healthcare system consuming an ever greater and potentially unsustainable share of the economy even as private health coverage lags. Last year, CMS estimated that government spending on healthcare would not overtake private spending until 2016, compared with 2011 or 2012 in the current report. \The health system is hurting, and we are seeing that in these numbers,\ said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a leading authority on healthcare policy. The report also points up the financial cost of the so-called Great Recession and the growing pressure it is putting on state and local governments. Federal and state spending on Medicaid, the nations primary health insurance program for low-income Americans, jumped nearly 10% in 2009, according to the report. Medicare spending, meanwhile, shot up just over 8%. Obama and many healthcare experts have argued that reshaping the healthcare system will ultimately make it more efficient, even if overall health spending continues to increase -- a claim Republicans dispute. Fueled by new technology, an aging population, rising incomes and other changes, spending on medical care has been consuming a larger and larger share of the nations economy for years, jumping from about 5% of the gross domestic product in 1960 to nearly 14% in 2000. But the recession that began in 2007 accelerated that trend, as the economy contracted while healthcare spending continued to increase, according to CMS. Even now, with the economy slowly recovering, the government expects that the growth of healthcare spending will outpace the expansion of the economy. By 2020, 1 of every 5 dollars spent in the U.S. is expected to go to healthcare. Some economists believe that this is not necessarily a problem, as the healthcare industry can provide good jobs and improve both health and productivity. But there is growing concern that as much as a third of the medical care delivered in this country does not help patients. \Are we getting value for the dollar? That is the question,\ said Len Nichols, health policy director at the centrist New America Foundation. \If you believe that so much medical care is unnecessary, as I do, then it is criminal that we are spending so much.\ Stuart Butler, vice president for domestic and economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that the numbers underscore the need for more aggressive action to curb spending. \The only way to do this is to simply spend less,\ Butler said, warning that the health bills being pushed on Capitol Hill do the opposite. CMS officials noted that healthcare spending has been increasing even as the number of Americans without health insurance is growing, another sign of problems with the system. \With higher unemployment, people lose their jobs [and] many of them lose their healthcare coverage in the process. And under current law, they don't have much to fall back on,\ said Richard S. Foster, chief actuary. Foster said that the report by his office indicated that two of the main trends driving calls for a health overhaul -- rising costs and shrinking numbers of people with health coverage -- are essentially the same as they were when the healthcare debate began last year. \Nothing much has changed in that regard,\ he said. Inefficiency is becoming a particularly acute problem for state and federal governments, which the report shows are increasingly supporting the nations healthcare system. Half a century ago, government accounted for just a quarter of all healthcare spending. Now, as the cost of caring for elderly and poor Americans swells, governments share of the total bill is fast becoming greater than that of the private sector. The trend accelerated in the recession, as Washington spent billions of dollars to help states prop up Medicaid programs being strained by the growing ranks of the unemployed and uninsured. The healthcare legislation being debated on Capitol Hill could increase the government commitment to healthcare as the federal government boosts the Medicaid program and provides billions of dollars of subsidies to low- and moderate- income Americans to help them buy insurance. But in a separate report a month ago, CMS actuaries estimated that the Senate healthcare bill would boost total healthcare spending by less than 1% over the next decade, in large part because the legislation includes initiatives to make Medicare more efficient.

C05739568	Anne-Marie Slaughter Sunday, March 13, 2011 9:39 PM Jacob Mills, Cheryl D; Reinesp@stategov; Abedin, Hurtle piece on libya nfz that will appear on NYT op-ed page tomorrow B6 wanted to make sure you had a heads up. AM Anne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton. By Anne-Marie Slaughter PRESIDENT Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi. In fact, it is tightening around the Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the worlds dithering and steadily retakes rebel-held tow.ns, The United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone while the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council and now the Arab League have all called on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. Opponents of a no- flight zone have put forth five main arguments, none of which, on closer examination, hold up. Its not in our interest. Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that \Libya doesn't sell much oil to the United States\ and that while Americans \want to support democratic movements in the region,\ they are already doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in terms of oil is exactly what Arab populations and indeed much of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about our professions of support for democracy and human rights. Now we have a chance to support a new beginning in the Muslim world — a new beginning of accountable governments that can provide services and opportunities for their citizens in ways that could dramatically decrease support for terrorist groups and violent extremism. Its hard to imagine something more in our strategic interest. It will be counter-productive. Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeeras director general, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most important about the Arab spring is that it is coming from Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military intervention will play right into Qaddatis hands, allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling on Arab civilians. But these arguments, while important, must be weighed against the appeals of of Libyan opposition fighters asking for international help, and now, astonishingly, against support for a no-flight zone by some of the same governments that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the specter of foreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that includes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab democrats.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. It wont work. The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daaider, argues that stopping Colonel Qaddafis air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and helicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential effect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafis own calculations about his future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although Colonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political manipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his military campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic advantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against him and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his offer of a negotiated departure. If it does work, we dont know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal divisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice is between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will conclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the opposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support their cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obamas June 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe. Lets arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of course, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between the desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretarys reluctance to participate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to ragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need action that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations. Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi will have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold. The United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and make clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition will be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as possible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an international coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should recognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has done, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests: U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739568 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

C05766276	Jake, Want to make sure you saw the front page story below. Its really about the tragedy of brothers wrongfully detained at Guantanamo but it makes clear that Palau is doing the U.S. a great service and has been more courageous in this regard than most of the world (although Palau is in many ways more vulnerable to China): The Secretary complimenting Pres. Toribiong re this was a good move right after Alcy upset the Palauans (as you feared) in a meeting I will give you a confidential report on separately. Jeff 2 Brothers Grim Tale Of Loyalty And Limbo To Leave Guantanamo Means Abandoning Family By Del Quentin Wilber Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, September 28, 2009 Bahtiyar Mahnut, a detainee at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, learned a few weeks ago that the Pacific island nation of Palau had invited him to settle there. It should have been cause for celebration, especially for a man who desperately wants to be free. But, to the surprise of his attorneys, Bahtiyar has turned down the offer. He wishes to remain a prisoner, they say, so he can look after his older brother, a fellow detainee. The brothers saga, as related by their attorneys and military records, could transpire only in the context of Guantanamo Bay and comes at a critical juncture for the Obama administration, which is struggling to meet a Jan. 22 deadline to shutter the 223-detainee prison. Their circumstances also highlight the diplomatic difficulties facing the U.S. government as it tries to find places to send prisoners not destined for terrorism trials in the United States. The brothers are Uighurs, residents of China who are considered separatists by Beijing but are not enemies of the United States. The brothers were picked up separately in Afghanistan and Pakistan soon after the United States launched attacks against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in retaliation for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Since at least 2003, the U.S. government has tried to find homes for the brothers and 20 other captured Uighurs. Five went to Albania in 2006; four were sent to Bermuda in June. At one point, U.S. officials were considering the possibility of resettling Uighurs in the D.C. region, but that plan was scuttled under political pressure. Most countries have been reluctant to accept Uighurs and risk angering China. In recent weeks, however, Palau has agreed to accept 12 of the 13 remaining Uighurs, according to the Justice Department. The only detainee not invited by Palau was Bahtiyars older brother, Arkin Mahmud, 45, who has developed mental health problems that are apparently too serious to be treated in the sparsely populated country, said his attorney, Elizabeth Gilson. To make matters worse, according to Gilson and military records, Arkin is a prisoner only because he went searching for Bahtiyar after the younger brother left their homeland eight years ago. \This is just very difficult and sad,\ said Abubakkir Qasim, 40, a Uighur freed from Guantanamo Bay in 2006 who considers himself a friend of both brothers. \Bahtiyar is turning away freedom for his brother,\ Qasim said through an interpreter. \His brother is only there because of Bahtiyar. I feel sorry for both of them.\ Five other Uighurs have declined the offer for a variety of reasons, according to one of their attorneys, Susan Baker Manning. The Justice Department says the government thinks that six to eight Uighurs will go to Palau. The earliest they could leave would be Thursday, the Justice Department says. Officials at the Defense and State departments and the Palau Embassy in Washington either declined to comment or did not return phone messages. In 2001, Bahtiyar and Arkin, both Muslims, were living with their parents and a younger brother in a small house in bustling Ghulja in Western China. Arkin is the father of two children, then 8 and 5. The brothers were not particularly devout but felt oppressed by the government of Beijing, which does not allow worship and ensures the best jobs go to ethnic Chinese. The brothers were forced to survive as menial tradesmen. Bahtiyar sold clothes; Arkin repaired shoes. Bahtiyar wanted to strike out on his own. So, with $700 in his pocket, he headed for Pakistan. But he quickly ran out of money and couldnt find work. He was worried about being sent back to China until a friend told him about a group of Uighurs in Afghanistan that wanted \to fight against the Chinese government.\ \If I went,\ he told military officials, \I didn't have to pay for food or anything. So I went to Afghanistan.\ There, he lived with 35 other Uighurs in a camp of dusty roads and shacks in the southern mountains. The group built houses and a mosque. They trained with one automatic rifle and did some push-ups, pull-ups and other calisthenics, records show. Within a few weeks of arriving at the camp, Bahtiyar managed to call home. His mother was very worried and told Arkin to find his brother. \He left because he was a dutiful son,\ Gilson said. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. military began bombing Afghanistan and destroyed Bahtiyars camp, sending the Uighurs into the mountains for shelter. Bahtiyar and others crossed into neighboring Pakistan, where they were arrested and turned over to U.S. authorities. Meanwhile, Arkin made his way to Afghanistan, where he was captured by the Northern Alliance and turned over the United States. At a military prison in Kandahar, the brothers saw each other across the razor wire. In 2002, the military brought the brothers and 20 other Uighurs to Guantanamo Bay. Authorities alleged at the time that the men trained at military-style camps affiliated with the Taliban or al-Qaeda. The accusations later dissolved upon close scrutiny by the courts. Arkin and Bahtiyar were confined in separate cells and, for months, were not able to talk. A Uighur interpreter working for the military, Rushan Abbas, persuaded the military in 2003 to allow the brothers to meet in an interrogation room. When they saw each other, they hugged and wept. \It was just so emotional,\ Abbas said. \These brothers from across the world coming together in an interrogation room for the first time.\ In 2005, Arkin remained in solitary confinement. He had a record of disciplinary infractions and had been disrespectful to the guards, records show. Not for the first time, Bahtiyar took steps to help his brother. Living in a more relaxed part of the prison, he was granted a request to be moved to Arkins camp. \I missed my brother so much,\ he told military officials. By the next year, the brothers had been cleared for release by the military. The government did not present any evidence to justify their detention in a federal lawsuit brought the Uighurs seeking their freedom. In October, a judge ordered them freed into the United States, but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Uighurs are awaiting word, expected this week, on whether the Supreme Court will hear the case. Last year, the remaining Uighurs were moved to a fenced-in camp that includes an activities room, video games and books. Through it all, Arkin and Bahtiyar have struggled to cope with being prisoners, perhaps for years to come. \I know I'll die in here,\ Arkin told Gilson not long ago. \In China, at least I would have a trial and sentence.\ Since taking their case in 2005, Gilson has met with Arkin dozens of times. But she had only spoken to Bahtiyar by phone. He had refused to meet with her, frustrated by lawyers always talking about what he considered fruitless legal victories. Two weeks ago, he changed his mind. Bahtiyar felt that he owed her an explanation for refusing Palaus generous offer. \Every day here is an eternity,\ he told Gilson through an interpreter. \But I have to look out for my brother.\ Jeffrey L. Farrow

C05769391	FYI: From one of the folks we hired who had been working with Pierre Louis: Lessons from the Aceh and Nias Multi-Donor Trust Fund 1. The Government of Indonesia (G01) responded to the Tsunami by issuing a series of government decrees, and immediately organized both overview and relief efforts to ensure a rational and coordinated response. The first task was to produce a Damage and Loss Assessment (DLA). The DLA was followed by a more detailed Master Plan for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (MPRR). The MPRR provided in-depth sector plans, spatial planning, the governance and supervision arrangements of finances with considerable attention to how to avoid or minimize corruption. The process behind the MPRR was consultative, with a wide range of local stakeholders and public offices being heard. The MPRR was presented on 26 March, only 3 months after the Tsunami. 2. The MPRR was to form the basis for a general three-stage strategy. The Relief phase was originally set to six months, but was then reduced to three: January- March 2005. The Rehabilitation phase is to run for about 21 months, through December 2006, and the Reconstruction phase from July 2006 through December 2009. The MPRR provides a well defined phasing of interventions. 3. The objectives for the Relief efforts were humanitarian relief: rescue; food and medicine; emergency infrastructure and temporary shelter; and burying the dead. The Rehabilitation phase is to restore services to minimum level: public services; economic facilities; banking and financial institutions; trauma treatments; secure land rights; law and order; and temporary shelter. Finally, Reconstruction is to rebuild the region: rebuilding the economy (production, trade and banking); the transportation, telecommunications, and social and cultural systems; improving institutional capacity; and housing. 4. The Government set up a ministerial-level agency to manage the MPRR program from Aceh itself, the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Aceh and Nias. The BRR was formally established end April 2005 and became operational early May. The World Bank Board on 30 March 2005 formally established the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDF) with a Steering Committee comprised of BRR, GOI, donors and civil society. Having a credible local coordinators was key to success. 5. The EC channels nearly 93% of its funds through the MDF, while only 2.5% of USD 400 million from the US goes to the MDF. While payments into the fund were slow, disbursements out of it were to begin with even slower. By October 2005, project agreements for about USD 200 million had been signed, but only USD 3 million had actually been disbursed. Disbursements picked up the pace thereafter. The delay was caused by two principal impediments: first, donors were quick to pledge funds, but getting all the exact written agreements in place took time. This points to the need for donors to be flexible regarding formal agreements, and accept simple, generic paragraphs that can contribute to speedy resolution of slightly differing phrasings and concerns. Second, the processing time for project approval and implementation was a concern. Since the MDF was to have funded projects on-budget, they had to be implemented by government institutions. This crated bottlenecks. 6. Smaller donors joined because they wished to support the reconstruction efforts in Aceh but do not have own capacity and often not strong views on how best to pursue this. They want the Bank to assume fiduciary responsibilities for the funds in a high-risk environment, and also to take a lead in ensuring that the funds go to prioritized activities. The MDF is thus seen a well-managed bank account with some paid- for administrative services. However, the all-inclusive Steering Committee made membership large and to some extent unwieldy, and forced it to discuss both policy and operational issues. 7. The Multi Donor Fund Secretariat has developed an Outreach Strategy that includes regular radio talk shows, field visits to meet and discuss with beneficiaries and communication through advertisements as well as a telephone hotline. 8. MDF received praise for engaging the Government of Indonesia (G01) in policy dialogue. The MDF is thus an entry point for engaging on conditions for sustainability, relevance and impact. 9. Because the MDF does not accept strict ear marking of donor contributions — though it does allow for preference indications — it means that the funds are freely available for programming according to the criteria and priorities that the MDF agrees to. Given strong GOI participation, the MDF is seen as the most successful instrument for harmonization and coordination in an environment that has been criticized for a lack of coordination. The MDFs Mid Term Review conducted in 2008-2009 found that the MDF had made a positive contribution to harmonizing donor efforts and to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the reconstruction effort. 10. The MDF did not sufficiently engage the private sector and did not have a coherent job creation strategy. The MDF lacked executive rights, but GOI and BRR are credited with leveraging a decisive response.

C05767605	sbwhoeop Saturday, January 9, 2010 9:42 AM H: Succinct summary on NI situation at this moment. Details to follow later. Sid January 9,2010 The First Lady, her young lover, and a scandal that could hand power to Sinn Fein David McKittrick reports on the far-reaching consequences of Iris Robinsons infidelity The mesmerising saga of the toyboy, the Northern Ireland First Minister and his straying wife threatened to engulf Belfasts frail political settlement last night. Following a day closeted with advisers Peter Robinson, head of the Northern Ireland government, broke his silence to insist defiantly that he would not step down after a day of turmoil. His move is unlikely to stem the clamour for an inquiry into an affair which has fused the political and the sexual. First indications are that members of his party, the Democratic Unionists (DUP), are reacting to the disclosures with strong disapproval. The party is highly religious and lays heavy emphasis on Christian family values. It is also currently highly nervous that the revelations could cost it seats in the coming Westminster election. If the DUP were to fracture as a result of the scandal it could lead the way to Sinn Fein becoming the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly - allowing it to nominate its own first minister and putting the peace process in jeopardy. Disclosures in a BBC television programme on the activities of his wife, Iris, who has exited from public life, led to a day- long flurry of political calls for inquiries into the Robinson family. Mr Robinson stands accused of failing to notify the authorities that his wife had been involved in financial transactions without declaring an interest. She helped a 19-year-old \toyboy\ lover to set up a business. Mr Robinson said he had asked for the appointment of a senior counsel \to ask me any questions he or she wishes to ask, and to give an opinion as to what I should have disclosed or whether I have breached an obligation\. Insisting he had done nothing wrong, Mr Robinson accused the BBC of broadcasting \smears and innuendo\. Saying that he did not rule out a defamation action, he declared: \I am being tried in the court of public opinion.\ Sinn Feins Martin McGuinness, who is Deputy First Minister, said he was shocked at the BBC revelations and is seeking talks with both Mr Robinson and Gordon Brown. Mr McGuinness was publicly sympathetic when news of the scandal broke, but his veering towards a tougher line is taken as indicating a calculation that Mr Robinson may not survive the storm. Mr Robinson, who has been First Minister for 18 months, is regarded as a pivotal figure in the peace process since he was prepared to follow the Rev Ian Paisley into government with Sinn Fein. But the state of the political settlement has appeared increasingly rocky as Mr Robinson has resisted pressure from almost all points of the political compass to complete devolution by accepting a transfer of responsibility for policing from London to Belfast. His reluctance to move on the policing issue was attributed to nervousness about challenges from hardline opponents in the Westminster general election. Now opponents are speculating that it might instead have at least partly been due to the family scandal which has just become public but which he knew of for months. In recent days Mrs Robinson dramatically announced that she was leaving politics. She is currently Westminster MP for east Belfast, a councillor and a member of the Belfast Assembly. Yesterday there were calls for her to depart immediately and stop drawing her salaries. These reflected the fact that, while her husband might have a faint chance of political survival, her behaviour is regarded as inexcusable. She had been a friend of Kirk McCambleys father, Billy. Before he died, he asked Mrs Robinson to look after his son. The BBC programme, Spotlight, revealed that her relationship with Kirk had developed into a sexual one. It said she suggested to him that he go into a business venture which was partly organised by Castlereagh council, where she is an alderman. She is said to have obtained £50,000 from two property developers, to be used to set up the business. She is also said to have helped approve the McCambley proposal without declaring a financial interest. The council said yesterday it was investigating. The young man was interviewed for the programme. So too was Mrs Robinsons one-time political adviser Selwyn Black, a former Methodist minister, who gave the BBC access to 150 text messages allegedly sent to him by Mrs Robinson. Among those calling for a public inquiry yesterday were Jim Allister of Traditional Unionist Voice, a hardline critic of Mr Robinson. He said the issues in the programme must be addressed \with utter transparency and candour\. Ulster Unionist leader Sir Reg Empey called for Mrs Robinsons immediate resignation, saying: \It is clear that Iris Robinsons continuing position as an MP, Assembly member and councillor is utterly untenable. She should resign all her positions with immediate effect.\ He added: \It is also unfortunately the case that the office of the First Minister is embroiled in these matters. My party will study the events outlined by the BBC and the very serious allegations that have been made with regards to the conduct of the First Minister. Inevitably the appropriate authorities will be required to investigate the allegations made against the First Minister.\ * Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward refused to speculate about Mr Robinson's future. But he said: \It is a responsibility on everyone in the Assembly to understand that the consequences of allowing the political process to slide would undoubtedly have an impact on the broader canvas. \And that if anybody were to be selfish enough to think this is a moment when that can be allowed to be put in the deep freeze, even some may wish to unpick, they would be extremely irresponsible, foolish and would be playing very, very dangerous games.\ Speaking to BBC Radio 4s Today programme, Mr Woodward said that the First Minister had to be allowed the opportunity to clear his name. But he went on: \Im very conscious of the fact that while all that is happening, he is First Minister and the business of devolution, the business of the Executive must go on. \I hope he will be able to resume the responsibilities as First Minister to ensure that the work of the Executive continues and that includes the talks on policing and justice devolution.\ PA

C05764568	Attached and enclosed below is the demarche and letter that went out, reflecting your comments. SUBJECT: DEMARCHE/LETTER PRIOR TO AUGUST 28 UNASUR SUMMIT REF: A. STATE 86734 B. STATE 82581 1.(SBU) This is an action request, see paras 4 - 6. 2.(SBU) On August 14, the USG and Colombian government provisionally agreed ad referendum to the text of a bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) (septel). We expect the final agreement may be signed in Bogota in about a month, following a final review by both sides. As noted in reftels, the DCA would permit the United States access to several Colombian military bases and facilitate effective bilateral cooperation on security matters in Colombia. It would not/not authorize establishment of any U.S. bases or ports, nor would it result in an overall increase in the number of U.S. military personnel or U.S.-citizen civilian contractors in Colombia. 3.(SBU) On August 18, the Secretary and Colombian FM Jaime Bermudez met in Washington to discuss the DCA, including the importance of coordinating our public affairs and diplomatic strategies (septel to follow). There is some concern that the upcoming Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) summit would become a regional referendum on the DCA. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe will attend the summit provided that a full range of regional security matters can be discussed, not just the DCA. In this context, we are reaching out to selected UNASUR members to ask that they raise other regional security issues beyond the DCA. 4. (SBU) Action requested for Santiago, Asuncion, and Lima: that you find an opportunity prior to the August 28 summit to raise the importance of discussing the full range of regional security topics during the summit, and not merely the DCA, with appropriate high levels of host government. 265 5. (SBU) Action requested for all: that Ambassadors to UNASUR member states deliver the attached letter from the Secretary to host governments in advance of the August 28 summit. 6. (U) Begin text: Dear Madam/Mr. Minister: I wanted to take a moment to write to you and your colleagues about the upcoming summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), scheduled for August 28 in Bariloche. UNASUR provides an important forum to address the issues and challenges that affect the region. The United States supports the formation and effective functioning of regional groups such as UNASUR. They promote stability, cohesion, and leadership on key issues, and ensure the best possible communication between nations. As you know, our common neighbor, Colombia, has faced an ongoing threat from an unholy alliance of terrorist groups funded by the insidious illegal narcotics trade. These terrorists have threatened the security of average Colombians and sought to overthrow by violence and corruption successive, democratically-elected Colombian governments. The actions of these groups also threaten the security of other countries in the hemisphere, sometimes directly, in many ways indirectly. Over the last decade, Colombians have beat back this threat, to the benefit of us all. My country is proud of the role we have been able to play in this effort. This battle is far from won. Our governments and people are collectively forced to find ways to protect ourselves and our institutions from such threats. I am certain these very issues will be addressed at the upcoming summit, including the recently concluded Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA). We understand the sensitivities associated with U.S. military activities in the hemisphere and the questions your government may have regarding the scope and extent of this agreement. I hope the efforts made in the last few weeks by both my government and the Colombian government have helped address those questions. I would like to take this opportunity to make several key points about the DCA. First, this agreement is a bilateral agreement with Colombia to deepen our cooperation on security challenges within Colombia, permitting U.S. access to specified agreed Colombian 26fi facilities to undertake mutually agreed activities on Colombian territory. It is a bilateral agreement that does not pose any threat or risk for the citizens of other nations. On the contrary, our mutual efforts to combat drug trafficking benefit the security of the region as a whole. The agreement does not permit the establishment of U.S. bases in Colombia. It will not result in an increase in the U.S. military presence in Colombia, and we do not seek any such increase. Activities undertaken at or from Colombian bases by U.S. persons will be coordinated in advance by Colombian authorities. All activities will be based on full respect for the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity of states, and non-interventionism. We are committed to being as forthcoming as possible in addressing concerns about this bilateral agreement with nations in the region, and we have endeavored to do so in recent weeks through a variety of mechanisms. As concerns or questions arise, I hope that you will feel free to reach out to us to seek clarification. The UNASUR summit provides a unique opportunity for the organization to address a range of security issues that affect the hemisphere, and I salute your leadership for deciding to discuss these matters. The security challenges affecting our hemisphere, and your nations in particular, are pressing and grave. Our firm belief is that a collective and collaborative approach to these matters is essential. It is our commitment to work with UNASUR nations to help address these concerns. Sincerely yours, Hillary Rodham Clinton End text.

We have aimed it really at press, to try to focus them as precisely as possible in what we want their stories to be, so its important to get those key message out. But I would just urge you also to speak from the heart -- you know what this is reallly about better than anyone and if your passion for making this happen and commitment to getting it done come through, it will frame the entire exercise. This is your only chance to speak to the press about 14 months of work until we relaunch in January.

C05763901	Report: North Korea willing to hold talks with US AP By KWANG-TAE KIM Associated Press Sat Jul 25, 4:51 am ET SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has indicated its interest in holding direct talks with the United States, a news report said, after the two sides traded barbs over Pyongyangs nuclear weapons programs at a security forum. \We are not against a dialogue. We are not against any negotiation for the issues of common concern,\ Japans Kyodo news agency quoted North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Sin Son Ho as saying Friday. But the ambassador, speaking in New York, dismissed the possibility of a return to stalled nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, the U.S., Japan, China and Russia, saying \the six-party talks are gone forever.\ The U.S. has offered to hold talks with the North within the six-nation process if it returns to the negotiating table and takes irreversible steps for denuclearization. Last weekend, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Kurt Campbell indicated that the chances for direct talks between North Korea and the U.S. were slim. \Our bilateral negotiations are between the U.S. and South Korea about our collective approach\ to the North, Campbell told reporters in Seoul. Sin said the five other parties to the nuclear talks \cheated\ North Korea, accusing them of not implementing what they had agreed under a disarmament-for-aid deal. No more details were given in the Kyodo report. Sin was not available for comment Saturday. The North Korean mission to the U.N. declined to comment. North Korea quit the nuclear talks in April to protest a U.N. statement condemning a rocket launch. North Korea insisted it sent a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and its allies said it was actually a long-range missile test. North Korea conducted its second nuclear test in May and a barrage of missile tests in July, drawing international condemnation and new U.N. sanctions. U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to discuss North Koreas nuclear programs and other regional security issues at a strategic dialogue next week in Washington. \North Korea will be a significant topic, but obviously one among many,\ State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said Friday in Washington. The U.S. and North Korea engaged in a sharp war of words earlier this week over U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintons recent comment likening the regime in Pyongyang to \small children\ demanding attention. At a regional security conference in Thailand, Clinton also said the North \has no friends left.\ North Koreas Foreign Ministry described her Thursday as \a funny lady\ who sometimes \looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping.\ 298

C05762421	FYI, Gary Sick's latest analysis on Iran below (posted on his blog). Sick has independent sources and is very well informed. June 17, 2009 Is this another Iranian revolution? To someone who has watched and studied the Iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination, developments in Iran today have an eerie reminiscence. Then there were massive protests that filled the streets, often marching in dignified but ominous silence; there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced determined but unarmed crowds; there were sullen mourning parades;20there were catchy chants and ritual calls of \Down with the shah!\; at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar. You need only change \shah\ to \dictator,\ and you have a description of what is happening in Iran today. But there is one very big difference. Thirty years ago, Iran had a charismatic cleric named Ayatollah Khomeini who had a refined sense of strategy and a willingness to risk everything for the cause he represented. On the other side was Mohammed Reza Shah, who had been on the throne for some 37 years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world. On the surface it appeared to be an uneven battle — guns against turbans — but the ruler with the guns wavered and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed. Today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is a reformed radical, Mir Hossein Mousavi, who is notably lacking in personal charisma. On the other side is the constitutional Leader, Ayatollah IChamene' i, who is widely perceived as a cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system and the institutions most loyal to him — particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful security forces, including the Revolutionary Guards. Neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces, let alone the situation. The fraudulent election defeat of Mousavi was a triggering event, but the energy behind these unprecedented demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by the regime than it is about any undying devotion to Mousavi. Yesterday Mousavi ordered that people stay home in face of a conflicting pro-regime demonstration. They marched anyway (and the daughter of former president Rafsanjani joined them and urged them on). Mousavi then \ordered\ everyone to march the following day (which they were probably going to do with or without his orders). IChamene'i announced the \divine assessment\ of the election outcome — even before it would probably have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots. Then, in the face of mass protests, he ordered an investigation of the results by the Guardian Council— the same organization that was responsible for managing the election in the first place. No one believed him in either case, and no one expected anything of importance from the Guardian Council. Khamene'i has ordered peace and reconciliation. No one paid any attention. I deliberately did not mention president-elect Ahmadinejad. After celebrating his \victory,\ he went off to a largely symbolic meeting in Moscow. He seems to be out of the decision loop and more of a passive player than a major actor in these events. So who is calling the shots? Mousavi seems to be running along after the crowd, not leading it. But that is probably all that is required to keep the protest in motion. On the other side, the very little evidence we have suggests that the important decisions are being made by the ultra-conservative leadership of the Revolutionary Guards, whose political role has ballooned over the past decade, perhaps in cooperation with their extremist counterparts in the clergy. They are utterly ruthless and ideologically fueled. New York Times columnist Nick Kristoff reminded us several days ago (see blog item on June 15 below) at the end of the day, as I saw at Tiananmen 20 years ago, when Might and Right do battle, it's often prudent to bet on Might, at least in the short run. The regime seems to have miscalculated badly. They seemed to believe that a sudden coup — the announcement of dramatic election results followed by a show of force — would intimidate and silence the opposition and consolidate their control. That is perhaps more understandable if the decisions were being made by military leaders who tend to see the battle in Manichaean terms, rather than politicians such as IChamene'i who are accustomed to seeing shades of gray. In any event, it b ackfired and they now have a much larger crisis on their hands than if they had simply arranged for Ahmadinejad to win by a slim margin (which was at least believable). All parties are now in uncharted territory. A significant portion of the Iranian population seems to have concluded that their social contract with the rulers — accepting Islamic rule in return for a respectful regard for the opinion of the governed, an Islamic Republic — is no longer valid. They do not trust their rulers. The rulers, whose support has been declining for years in the face of their own inept management of the country, are increasingly replacing popular support with repression. This election seems to have called that tactic into question. For the military, the obvious answer is more repression. So it would appear to be a moment to bet on Might. But nobody is fully in command of events. Decisions taken in the next weeks will be fateful and could determine the future path of the Iranian revolution. There is another lesson as Iran's leaders contemplate a Tiananmen moment. When the Tiananmen crackdown occurred almost exactly ten years ago, one of the leaders of China at the time was Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party. He was later fired and placed under house arrest. His smuggled memoirs have just appeared, revealing the depth of disagreements within the lea dership about how to proceed. Is it possible that ten years from now we will have a volume describing the intense debates that one can only presume are underway today in the highest councils of the Islamic Republic of Iran?

C05763790	HRC: Back this morning from Asia. Congratulations on the speech. I think it came out great. And the reaction I have heard today has been very positive. Let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with Israel as I understand it, i.e. a moratorium coupled with allowances to complete a number of housing units. There are two ways: 1. To describe it as an agreement, explaining why the US has accepted an Israeli completion of a handful of units whose construction already has begun. This raises some concerns. It would represent U.S. legitimization of some (however small) Israeli activity in the West Bank and it would trigger Arab and Palestinian complaints that we had compromised, sowing doubts about our effectiveness. 2. The alternative would be for the administration to say: a. We have come a very long way, as Israel has made unprecedented commitments to the U.S. in terms of a settlements freeze. This is a very welcome development. b. We did not achieve all that we had hoped as Israel intends to complete a number of housing units. We have differences with the Israeli government on this matter which we have expressed to them.. •c. That said, we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as Arab steps toward Israel that will help promote a two-state solution. This latter option retains our credibility, does not compromise our oft-stated position and allows us to move forward. Of course, I am around if you want to discuss. Good luck in India. They are very excited about your visit. Sandy

STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days. There is no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraqs progress. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost friends and loved ones, and we salute the determination of the Iraqi people to reaffirm their commitment to democracy and to charting their own future free of fear and intimidation. Thanks to the efforts of the Iraq High Electoral Commission and the Iraqi Security Forces, which organized the voting and ensured security at thousands of polling sites throughout the country, Iraqi men and women from all parts of the country were able to go to the polls and choose their leaders freely. I also would like to commend Ambassador Hill, General Odierno and all the U.S. civilian and military personnel who supported this historic effort. Iraqis have chosen a new government to lead their country at a critical time. In the coming months, we will work together with Iraqi leaders as our partnership continues its transition to a primarily civilian focus, with the goal of building a long-term, multidimensional relationship between our two nations - a relationship that will contribute to stability in the Middle East and growing peace and prosperity in Iraq. ###

C05767638	Guardian sbwhoeop Thursday, October 29, 2009 7:08 PM H; Doug Band fyi: Blair's chances seem to be cratering in EU. Sid Tony lair's bid for EU residency sinks Ex-PM's chances of winning role slide as Sarkozy and Merkel fail to back him • Nicholas s‘tv'at.i. and )an,..Trajf.pf in Brussels • u!,-„ Thursday 29 October 2009 21.26 GMT T20.,.:31::.3.1:7's hopes of becoming Europe's first sitting president were receding fast tonight as Britain admitted his chances of success were \fading\ after the continent's centre-right leaders made it clear one of their own must have the post. Hours after G .nr.4, ,efl Srov.,,h delivered his strongest statement of support for Blair — disclosing that he had spoken to him earl;er this week — British sources indicated that the former prime minister was unlikely to assume the high-profile. job. \it would be right to describe Tonys c,hances as fading,\ one British source said.\..slcgles. t. ..aar.sa; and are not terribly enthusiastic. Silvio Berlust.-,oni remains his strongest backer.\ Bialr's expected failure to secure the post of president of the European Council meant that ca,•,-,'et., ..\it;ity.n-te was emerging as a serious contender to assume the new post of high representative for foreign policy. The foreign secretary insisted, however, that.he was \not available\. Miliband spoke out as British sources said it had become clear in recent days that Blair would struggle to become president. The post is likely to be filled in the next month amid signs that the Czech Republic will become the last EU country to ratify the Lisbon treaty. Sarkozy, the French president, and Merkel, the German chancellor, are understood to have agreed at a dinner at the Elysee Palace last night that the new president should be appointed from the main centre-right EPP grouping, which brings together the parties currently ruling most EU countries. Brown gave a hint at a press conference that Blairs candidacy was fading when he qualified his strong backing for his predecessor by stating that there were also other candidates for the job. \Of course it may not happen and there are other candidates as well,\ he said. The prime ministers remarks came after he attended an acrimonious meeting of the European centre-left leaders this afternoon, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels began. Brown was understood to have had a tense exchange with Martin Schulz, the German leader of the Socialists in the European parliament, who wants the left to assume the new foreign policy post, leaving the presidency to the centre right. Brown told the meeting: \You need to get real. This is a unique opportunity to get a progressive politician to be the president of the council.\ But it soon became clear that Blair has no support on the left, let alone on the centre right. Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Spains centre-left prime minister, for the first time publicly queried the Blair candidacy by announcing that the centre left across the EU was more concerned with securing the other post of European foreign minister. Zapatero, who will have to work with the new European figureheads when Spain assumes the Etis six-month rotating presidency on 1 January, said the European socialists were clear that they want the post of the high representative. \There is a preference for the high representative,\ he said. \That is rather reasonable.\ A senior Spanish official said this was the first time that Zapatero had \dropped Blair\ and that the centre-left in the EU was seeking a deal with the centre-right, led by Merkel. The centre-right would get the job coveted by Blair, while the centre left would take the foreign minister post. The lack of support for Blair became clear when Jean Asselborn, Luxembourgs foreign minister, launched a strong attack on him as be emerged from the meeting of Socialist leaders. \lt is not about the person of Tony Blair. Now in the United States, Obama is the president, it is no more Mr Bush. We have a new treaty, we have to reset Europe and we need to start with some new ideas. There is and will remain a link for the next generation between Iraq, Bush and Tony Blair.\ Downing Street wiil resist criticism that it was wrong to mount such a strong campaign in favour of Blair when it had become clear earlier this week that his chances were fading. Brown believes it was right — and in the national interest — to argue strongly for Blair when there was a chance to secure such a senior post for Britain. Blair, who had a tense relationship with Brown during his decade as prime minister, will be pleased by the strength of his successors support. Brown said today: \Let me say very clear that we, the British government, believe that Tony Blair would be an excellent candidate and an excellent person to hold the job of president of the council. \His international experience is well known, his expertise on environmental, economic and security issues is well known to everybody throughout Europe as well as known throughout the world If you have the chance for that to happen it is in Britains national interest.\ guardian.co.uk Guardian News and Media Limited 2009

C05767932	FYI — POLITICO Boehner chief of staff dies at 46 By: Patrick OConnor January 10, 2010 01:40 PM EST Paula Nowakowski, the longtime chief of staff to House Republican Leader John Boehner, died unexpectedly Saturday night, according to the leaders office. She was 46. \It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski, my longtime chief of staff, trusted aide and friend, who died suddenly last night,\ Boehner said in a statement early Sunday afternoon. \Words cannot adequately express the sorrow and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with today in the wake of this stunning news.\ A Boehner aide said the cause was an apparent heart attack. President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were among those who called Boehner Sunday to offer their condolences on Nowakoskis death. \The entire Capitol Hill community is shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of Paula Nowakowski,\ Pelosi said in a statement. \As Chief of Staff to Republican Leader John Boehner, Paula earned the respect not only of her Leadership and Conference, but all House Members on both sides of the aisle. She served Leader Boehner both in his current position as well as previously at the Committee on Education and the Workforce with great distinction. \Paula was a thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive and bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently. On behalf of the entire House, I express our deep sadness to Paulas family, friends and our colleague, Leader John Boehner.\ \Paula had some of the finest qualities a public servant can have: she was committed to advancing the cause of freedom, she cared deeply about the people she served, and she was a patriot,\ said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY.). \On behalf of her senate colleagues, I pass on my condolences to her family, Leader Boehner and his staff, and the whole House family for this tragic loss of our friend.\ It would be hard to overstate Nowakowski's role in Boehner's tight-knit office. She has worked for the Ohio Republican almost continuously since 1995, when she joined his staff as communications director for the Republican Conference. In the years since, she has worked as staff director for the Education and Labor Committee and served as his chief of staff since he returned to the leadership in early 2006. She briefly left Boehner's side in 1998 after he lost the conference post following a tough election for Republicans but rejoined him in 2001 when he assumed the chairmanship of the Education and Labor Committee. Along the way, she counseled Boehner on just about every decision he made and often served as an enforcer of sorts for the collegial Republican leader. It would be hard to find any chief of staff on Capitol Hill who maintained a closer relationship with her boss than the one she shared with Boehner. Aides said Sunday that Boehner's office and extended network of former colleagues, known to many as \Boehner-land,\ were collectively shocked by the news. \We will remember Paula as she would want to be remembered — as a tireless worker, faithful friend, rabid Detroit sports fan, whip-smart strategist, warrior for freedom and devoted Catholic who counted President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II among her greatest heroes. She will never be replaced or forgotten,\ Boehner said. \I ask for your prayers for Paulas family.\ ©2009Capitol News Company, LLC FD HIDDEN DIV Tmt Washington ost NEWS! POLITICS I OPINIONS!

Boehners chief of staff, dies at 46 By Martin Weil Washington Post Staff Writer Monday, January 11, 2010; B04 Paula Nowakowski, 46, chief of staff for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner, was found dead Jan. 10 at her home in Alexandria. No official cause of death was available. Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Boehner (R-Ohio), said it appeared that Ms. Nowakowski died of a heart attack. A longtime Hill aide, and Boehners staff chief since 2006, Ms. Nowakowski was named by the Capitol Hill publication Roll Call to its 2009 list of the \Fabulous Fifty\ staff members. The accolade recognized her savvy, her clout and her access to the top people in Congress. Ms. Nowakowski, an avowed conservative, was highly regarded by leaders of both parties. She was praised by Boehner and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \It is with profound sadness and shock that I announce the passing of Paula Nowakowski, my longtime chief of staff, trusted aide, and friend, who died suddenly,\ Boehner said in a statement. \Words cannot adequately express the sorrow and disbelief I and every member of our team are grappling with today in the wake of this stunning news,\ Boehner said. Pelosi called Ms. Nowakowski a \thorough professional who loved the House and worked in a constructive and bipartisan fashion to implement policies to help the Congress function efficiently.\ According to WhoRunsGov. corn, a Washington Post Co. Web site, Ms. Nowakowski grew up in St. Clair Shores, Mich., and studied English at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. She told Politico of being made more conservative by the campus \rise of the loony left,\ citing \wacky, wacky stuff,\ which shaped her politics. According to a reference book on congressional aides, she worked for the Republican National Committee in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then joined the staff of the House Republican Conference. After two years as a public affairs vice president of the American Insurance Association, she worked from 2001 to 2006 as staff director of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce. A Boehner aide said she worked for him at both the Republican Conference and the Education Committee. Pelosis staff chief, John Lawrence, who was Ms. Nowakowskis Democratic counterpart on the education committee, said they transcended political differences to \work in a very collegial way to strengthen the House itself.\ He called her \a great professional.\ After the GOP lost its House majority in 2006 , Ms. Nowakowski said she experienced \the seven stages of grief,\ according to the Almanac of the Unelected 2008, a reference on Hill staffers. \You don't want to be a compliant minority,\ she said of the partys new status, \but you have to adjust your expectations.\ In his statement, Boehner called Ms. Nowakowski \a tireless worker, faithful friend and rabid Detroit sports fan. Survivors include her longtime companion, Michael Smith, her mother, a brother and a sister. C 2010 The Washington Post Company
C05767935	STATEMENT OF SECRETARY CLINTON The Passing of Victoria DeLong This morning I spoke with the family of Victoria DeLong, the Cultural Affairs Officer at our Embassy in Port-Au-Prince who lost her life in the earthquake. I expressed my sincerest condolences on behalf of the men and women of the State Department and the American people. This is one tragedy among so many. The United Nations has suffered grevious losses. And the Hatian people have endured unimaginable heartbreak. For the State Department, we have lost one of our own. Victoria was a veteran Foreign Service Officer who worked tirelessly to build bridges of understanding and respect between the people of the United State and the people of Haiti. She served her country with distinction and honor, and she will be sorely missed. Victorias friends and colleagues at the Embassy are working day and night to support vital relief and recovery efforts, and our thoughts, our prayers, and our deepest thanks are with them as well. Along with the military personnel, the search and rescue teams, and all the aid and relief workers now deploying, they represent the unwavering commitment of the United States to stand with Haiti in its hour of need and in the hard days and years to come. My heart is with the DeLong family today, and with all those in Haiti and around the world who have lost loved ones and friends in this disaster.

C05766309	newmyer on behalf of Jackie Newmyer Tuesday, September 29, 2009 11:20 AM H new Iran-China oil deal, reported in Iran (in English) and in China (in Chinese) B6B6 Secretary Clinton, Just wanted to make sure that you saw the news about one of China's oil conglomerates and the Iranian National Oil Company over the weekend: Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal, Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne, Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) that covers a 90 percent stake in the project. A likely explanation would be that this deal has been long in the making. Still, Tehran's motivation for releasing this information in English at this time is worth considering. The whole story from an English-language Iranian outlet is pasted in below, and I found three Chinese-language sources with corroborating reports (nothing in English from China, though): http://business.sohu.com/20090929/n267094148.shtml http://money.163.com/09/0929/14/5KCSKN5F002524SO.html http://finance.sina.com.cn/world/gjjj/20090929/18566807524.shtml Jackie Press TV Iran, China sign a major oilfield deal Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:05:09 GMT China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has signed a contract with National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the development of Iran's South Azadegan oilfield. The Chinese company will buy a 70 percent share of the whole project, according to an agreement signed Sunday in Lausanne, Switzerland between CNPC and NIOC's overseas investment subsidiary, Naftiran lntertrade Company (NICO) that covers a 90 percent stake in the project. CNPC, which won a bid in January to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, now holds a 70 percent share of the project with NICO holding 20 percent, and Inpex of Japan having the remaining 10 percent. The South Azadegan project is slated to produce 260,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and its development will cost around $2.5 billion. The field, along the Iraqi border, holds reserves estimated at approximately 42 billion barrels of oil, one of the world's largest finds in the last 30 years. Iran provides 14 percent of China's demand for oil. The deal is couched in buy-back terms, in which CNPC will hand over the operation of the field to NIOC after development and will receive payments from the oil production for a few years to cover its investment. China's investment in Iran's energy sector has increased as some western countries, led by the US, have sanctioned Iran over its peaceful nuclear program.

C05766101	Will do. Below is the formal statement that was released in the PM's name: Today, my cabinet authorized a policy of restraint regarding settlements which will include a suspension of new permits and new construction in Judea and Samaria for a period of ten months. My cabinet authorized this far reaching step because of our deep desire for peace. We hope that this decision will help launch meaningful peace negotiations to reach a historic peace agreement that will finally end the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. We are committed to working closely with the United States to advance peace and security in the region. We have been told by many friends that once Israel takes the first step towards peace, the Palestinians and the Arab world would respond positively with steps of their own to create a virtuous cycle of goodwill. Well, the government of Israel is taking a very big and difficult step toward peace today. I hope that the Palestinians and the Arab world will seize this opportunity to work with us to forge a new beginning and a new future for our children and for their children. Since the day our government was sworn in eight months ago, we have been calling for direct negotiations with the Palestinians. During that time, we have taken many concrete actions to improve daily life for the Palestinians and to create a climate in which political negotiations would have the best chance to succeed. We have dismantled hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints, extended the hours of operation on the Allenby Bridge and removed bureaucratic obstacles to Palestinian economic development. These actions have helped spur a surge, a boom, in the Palestinian economy. At the same time, the security environment has improved thanks both to the efforts of the IDF and to the efforts of better trained PA security forces. Now we wish to add to this improved economic and security climate meaningful political negotiations. I have already said that we will not build new settlements and that we would not expropriate additional land for existing settlements. I said we would also restrain settlement activity, and that's exactly what we decided to do today. I promised to enable normal life to continue for the three hundred thousand Israeli citizens, our brothers and sisters, who live in Judea and Samaria. That is why this suspension will not affect construction currently underway. It will not include the schools, kindergartens, synagogues and public buildings necessary for the continuation of normal life over the time period of the suspension. Obviously, any infrastructure that may be needed to protect our national security or to safeguard the lives of our citizens will also be provided during this time. Regarding Jerusalem, our sovereign capital, our position is well known. We do not put any restrictions on building in our sovereign capital. As always, we are committed to protect freedom of worship for all faiths and to ensure equal and fair treatment for all the city's residents, Jews and Arabs alike. When the suspension ends, my government will revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to construction. I want to say clearly to the Palestinians: Now is the time to begin negotiations. Now is the time to move the peace process forward. There is no more time to waste. Israel has taken a far reaching step for peace. It's time for the Palestinians to do the same.

It allows them to fuzz up the hard parts of a negotiation -- the \final status\ issues, as they're often called -- and save them for later, when the parties are more amenable to pressure. This devotion to \constructive ambiguity\ has been a hallmark of U.S. peacemaking on the Palestinian-Israeli issue for 40 years. Rather than state the unpalatable concessions that most analysts recognize will be required for any viable settlement -- that Israelis must share sovereignty in Jerusalem and that Palestinians must give up the \right of return\ to Israel -- successive U.S. administrations have tried to defer these unmentionables until later. But the fog machine blew apart this month, when the isr3e1Interipr i‘,1!inista_rndLinced du ..ripq. visit ily__Vde President Biden that Israel would build 1,600 more housipg priits in ,lerusal. erp. The Obama administration was upset, to put it mildly: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the housing announcement a \deeply negative signal\ about U.S.-Israeli relations and \an insult.\ In the ensuing hubbub over the \crisis\ in U.S.-Israeli relations, there have been frantic attempts to pretend it was all a misunderstanding and pull the cloak of ambiguity back over the peace process. But that's a mistake. The East Jerusalem move wasn't an accident but an emphatic public statement of the Israeli right's rejection of concessions on Jerusalem. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu had been trying to play along with U.S. requests to fuzz the issue by avoiding provocative actions on Jerusalem. But the right-wing Shas party, which controls the Interior Ministry, basically called his bluff. \Freezing building in East Jerusalem is one of those things we cannot do,\ said Dore Gold, a right-wing former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. And Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli foreign minister and a settler himself, responded: \Can you imagine if they told Jews in New York they could not build or buy in Queens?\ So what should the administration do, now that the Israeli right has put Jerusalem squarely on the table despite the best efforts of the ambiguity-addicted diplomats? The administration's best strategy is to do what it considered a year ago, which is to state clearly the basic principles that must frame these negotiations. Those guidelines have been articulated well by Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser: real sharing of Jerusalem; no right of return for the Palestinians; a return to the 1967 borders, with mutual adjustments to allow for big Israeli settlement blocks; and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Every negotiation for the past four decades has converged toward those parameters. The Obama administration debated whether to issue such a statement of principles a year ago, when it began its peacemaking effort. Launching negotiations with this \big bang\ made sense to some officials, including Gen. Jim Jones, the national security adviser, But George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy, argued that based on his experience in the Northern Ireland peace talks, it was better to let the parties haggle before the United States stepped in with bridging proposals. Rather than stating U.S. negotiating principles at the outset, the Obama team decided instead to push Netanyahu on settlements. The administration picked this fight in the flush of President Obama's first months in office, confident that he was so strong and Netanyahu so weak that if it came to a showdown, Netanyahu would cave. The Israeli leader coolly bided his time, dickering about procedural issues while Obama got weaker politically by the month. Netanyahu finally agreed in November to a temporary moratorium on new settlements -- but it excluded Jerusalem. The administration should have seen what was coming. In retrospect, it seems clear that the step-by-step approach was a mistake: Constructive ambiguity, in this case, proved destructive. It allowed the Israeli right wing to perpetuate the idea that it could have it all -- obtain a peace deal without making concessions on Jerusalem. And it allowed Netanyahu to continue his straddle. Jerusalem is the hardest issue of all in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiation, and for that reason, would-be peacemakers have wanted to save it for last. But this month's crisis makes that strategic waffling impossible. Thanks to the Israeli right, the Jerusalem issue is joined. What's needed now is for Obama to announce that when negotiations begin, the United States will state its views about Jerusalem and other key issues -- sketching the outlines of the deal that most Israelis and Palestinians want. If Netanyahu refuses to play, then we have a real crisis in U.S.-Israeli relations. davidignatius_@washpost.corn Post a Comment View all comments that have been posted about this article.

C05765118	sbwhoeoP Thursday, November 5, 2009 12:28 AM H FYI: Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 2009 edition. Sid France: 'Autistic Tories have castrated UK in Europe' French Europe minister says David Cameron's pledge to reclaim EU powers is 'pathetic' and will leave Britain isolated Nicholas',Nat, Patrick yVintpur and :15;rattori. c.,uardiari.,;:o.uk, Wednesday 4 November 2009 21.30 GMT The Cohseri?t,vea were accused by the French government tonight of \castrating\ Britain's position within the EU by adopting an \autistic\ approach that would take Britain off the radar. Speaking to the Guardian, Pierre Lellouche, France's Europe minister, described as \pathetic\ the Tories' EU plans announced today, warning they would not succeed \for a minute\. Giving vent to frustration across the EU, which has so'far only been expressed in private, Lellouche — who said he was reflecting Nicolas Sarkozy's \sadness and regret\ — accused William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, of a \bizarre autism\ in their discussions. He said: \They have one line and they just repeat one line. It is a very bizarre sense of autism.\ Lellouche, one of the most Anglophile members of Sarkozy's government, made his remarkable intervention after David Caii.e.con outlined a fresh Tory approach to the EU in the wake of the full ratification of the Lisbon treaty. A future Conservative government would seek to strengthen British sovereignty and repatriate a series of powers Over social and employment legislation, the Tory leader said. Cameron said he was not seeking an immediate \bust-up\ with the EU, and would allow the repatriation of powers negotiations to last as long as five years. But that position was not enough for the Tory MEP Daniel Hannan, who quit his role as the party's legal affairs spokesman in Europe, saying he intended to fight for referendums to enable Britain to become \self-governing\. France's centre-right government condemned Cameron's plans, saying that they would marginalise Britain within the EU. Abandoning all diplomatic niceties, Lellouche said: \Its pathetic. Its just very sad to see Britain, so important in Europe, just cutting itself out from the rest and disappearing from the radar map .... This is a culture of opposition ... It is the result of a long period of opposition. I know they will come back, but I hope the trip will be short.\ He said Cameron's approach was in line with the Tories' decision to abandon the main centre-right EPP grouping in the European parliament, of which Sarkozy's UMP party is a member. \They are doing what they have done in the European parliament. They have essentially castrated your UK influence in the European parliament,\ he said. Lellouche said he has told Hague personally that his position was a \waste of time for all of us\. \I have told William Hague: go away for two to three years, in your political economic situation youre going to be all by your self and youll come back. Go ahead and do it. That is my message to them ... You want to be marginalised? Well, you go for it. But its a waste of time for all of us,\ the French minister said. Lellouche made clear the Tories had no hope of securing support for their plans. \Its not going to happen for a minute. Nobody is going to indulge in rewriting [treaties for] many, many years. Nobody is going to play with the institutions again. Its going to be take it or leave it and they should be honest and say that,\ he said. \It is a time of tumultuous waters all around us. Wars, terrorism, proliferation, Afghanistan, energy with Russia, massive immigration, economic crisis. It is time when the destiny of Europe is being defined — whether or not we will exist as a third of the worlds GDP capable of fighting it out on climate, on trade, on every ... issue on the surface of the Earth. \We need to be united, otherwise we will be wiped out and marginalised. None of us can do it alone. Whether you're big or small, the lessbn is the same. And [Britain's] risk is one of marginalisation. Irrelevance.\ He explained: \Finally we have institutional package, but it took 15 years of looking at our navel and getting everybody bored to death with sterile debate\. In a sign of Frances determination to resist the Tory plans to opt out of key EU legislation, Lellouche warned the French would attempt to reduce Britains EU budget rebate which will be up for negotiation during the next parliament. He pointed out that France is a net EU contributor to the tune of €5bn (E4.5bn), unlike Britain which receives a rebate. \If we get a government that is ferociously anti European that will vote down this kind of legislation then I think the relationship is going to be very difficult. As we enter the next phase one of the issues we have to discuss midterm is of course finances. France is a net contributor to the tune of €5bn a year, of which €1.5bn is the same as British rebate. That should tell you quite a bit huh?\ he said. Cameron will be angered by the attack, and what it implies for Tory relations with the rest of Europe although in the short term he will be more concerned to ensure his strategy of abandoning a referendum on the Lisbon treaty does not provoke cries, of betrayal on his backbenches. Hague reacted to the French criticism by insisting that Lellouches comments did not represent the true reception of the Tories plans in Europe. \That is not how we are seen across Europe,\ he told BBC2s Newsnight, adding his party had established good relations with Sarkozys party. \1 don't think you will find that's representative of the reaction in Paris or other European capitals,\ he added.

C05765924	Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov> Monday, September 14, 2009 10:51 AM H FW: Hitting Bottom in Foggy Bottom RELEASE IN FULL FP FortAgn Policy Hitting Bottom in Foggy Bottom The State Department suffers from low morale, bottlenecks, and bureaucratic ineptitude. Do we need to kill it to save it? BY MATTHEW ARMSTRONG I SEPTEMBER 11, 2009 Discussion over the fate of Foggy Bottom usually focuses on the tenure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the troubles of public diplomacy, and the rise of special envoys on everything from European pipelines to Afghanistan and Pakistan. But Americans would benefit more from a reassessment of the core functionality of the U.S. State Department. Years of neglect and marginalization, as well as a dearth of long-term vision and strategic planning, have left the 19th- century institution hamstrung with fiefdoms and bureaucratic bottlenecks. The Pentagon now funds and controls a wide range of foreign-policy and diplomatic priorities -- from development to public diplomacy and beyond. The world has changed, with everyone from politicians to talking heads to terrorists directly influencing global audiences. The most pressing issues are stateless: pandemics, recession, terrorism, poverty, proliferation, and conflict. But as report after report, investigation after investigation, has highlighted, the State Department is broken and paralyzed, unable to respond to the new 21st-century paradigm. But how did it get so bad? Is it possible to fix? Or should we just push it over the wall like a great Humpty Dumpty and reassign the pieces? There is growing evidence that the internal machinations of the State Department have corrupted its \core missions\ of traditional diplomacy and public diplomacy. This year, for example, the Government Accountability Office (gao) found that the department completely failed in its now four-year-old attempt to reorganize its nonproliferation bureau (a bureau that remains leaderless). Besides failing to address mission overlap, low morale, and lack of career opportunities, the failed reorganization caused a significant drop in expertise in offices focused on proliferation issues -- including \today's threats posted by Iran, North Korea, and Syria,\ the gaos report said -- and coordination with bodies like the International Atomic Energy Agency. Another report by the State Departments inspector general this year described severe and broad dysfunction within the Africa bureau, while ignoring -- perhaps considering it a given -- the lack of departmentwide integration and leadership in operations. Examples of the dysfunction range from not providing public diplomacy personnel with computers capable of reading interoffice memos to a failure to effectively work with the new Africa Command. By necessity, the Defense Department has stepped in where State Department has tuned out: Foggy Bottom relies on Pentagon funding and even personnel for basic operations central to its mission. For example, the Defense Department now performs much strategic communications work traditionally the purview of the State Department. In Somalia, for example, the State Departments budget for public diplomacy is $30,000. The Pentagons is $600,000. And, in the State Departments bureaucratic wisdom, the $30,000 does not even belong to its undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs. Further, rivalries between the different \cones\ -- or career tracks, referred to by one insider as the \conal caste system\ -- at the State Department severely impact morale, career growth, and even operations. The report on the Africa bureau noted that in 2002, public affairs and public diplomacy was a \failed office\ -- and that the situation is worse in 2009. Public outreach workers said the bureaus leadership \does not understand public diplomacy.\ The sentiment is widespread. A 2008 report by a congressional ombudsman, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, described a systemic failure to support and train public diplomacy officers in the field, as well as professional discrimination against those in the career track. Attempts to fix the State Department have focused on short-term issues, such as ameliorating its shortages in human and financial resources. The last eight secretaries of state have attempted to bolster the department by bolstering its bottom line. No less than Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, have long suggested transferring funds from the Defense Department to State Department. But the situation is so dire that the State Department, at this point, could not even absorb and spend that much-needed infusion of cash. If there were a wholesale transfer of funds tomorrow, the lack of capacity and skills at the State department would mean it would have to give it back to the Defenk Department or dole it out to contractors. The creeping militarization of U.S. foreign policy is itself deeply worrying, not just to Gates and Mullen, but also to such luminaries as Secretary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden. In 2008, then-Senator Biden questioned the \expanding role of the military in U.S. foreign policy.\ He said he was concerned by the \migration of functions and authorities from U.S. civilian agencies to the Department of Defense.\ Some commentators have even wondered aloud whether the best way to fix the State Department might be to destroy it. Foggy Bottom could retain a small core staff for its embassies and ambassadors. All other functions -- such as public diplomacy, countering misinformation and propaganda, and development, including provincial reconstruction staffing -- could migrate to the Pentagon or become wholly independent agencies. But atomizing the State Department would ultimately prove dangerous and further the militarization of foreign policy. The Pentagon needs a counterbalance, a vertically integrated State Department that the president, Congress, and the U.S. public can count on. Change, rather than creative destruction, is what Foggy Bottom needs. Envision a State Department capable of leading whole-of-government initiatives with a strategic focus instead of one hidebound department geared by structure and tradition to execute state-to-state diplomacy. This \Department of State and Non-State\ would be as deft at tackling stateless terrorist networks and hurricanes as it would be at fostering and upholding alliances with foreign ministers. To transform Foggy Bottom in this way will require breaking the rigid hierarchy, stovepipes, and bottlenecks which make the Pentagon look lean and dynamic in comparison. Modern global affairs are not compartmentalized by political borders. Besides expanding the overly shallow and narrow authorities of the public diplomacy bureau, Clinton must restructure the State Department to focus less on countries and more on regions. Currently, each of Foggy Bottoms regional bureaus, such as Near East Affairs, is configured to oversee its patch of embassies. Country desk officers, and most ambassadors, report to an assistant secretary, the regional head. The assistant secretary in turn reports to an undersecretary, who reports to Clinton. Clinton should name the regional bureau heads, currently assistant secretaries, to undersecretary status. This would help eliminate an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and would also align the State Department with the Defense Department (which has powerful regional commands, such as Centcom and Africom). The State Departments regional leaders would hold an equivalent civilian rank to four-star combatant commanders like Gen. David Petraeus. These changes would promise to improve communications, synchronize missions, and put the department on the right path for todays requirements. But Clinton should beware reforming the State Department too quickly from within -- her efforts could be paralyzed by a bureaucracy in mutiny that would simply wait her out. U.S. national security would suffer and the Pentagons growing power would become more entrenched. Clinton will need the clear and unequivocal support of the president and more importantly Congress, which authorizes State Department spending bills, to have a chance at success. In a burst of activity after Barack Obamas election, Congress authorized more money and people for the State Department and pushed for greater public diplomacy. Still more is required. The question asked over the last eight years as the State Department abrogated its various responsibilities -- if not Defense, then who? -- will not, indeed cannot, be answered until the department steps up to the plate and becomes effective and visible in leading and implementing U.S. foreign policy. This will take time. But, as the saying goes, there is no time like the present. The United States now has a Congress that supports change, secretaries of state and defense who want change, a president whose entire election platform was built around the word \change,\ and an American public that would be outraged at the dysfunction if it only knew the details. 3

C05772161	Post-Daley circus gets started early Easier to count those who arent running than those who are By Rick Pearson, Hal Dardick, Tribune reporters 11:17 PM CDT, September 8,2010 The post-Daley era in Chicago politics began Wednesday with all of the promise of baseballs Opening Day — no winners, no losers and everyone proclaiming they have a shot at the crown. With Mayor Richard Daley saying he would not endorse a successor for the Feb. 22 city election, various political factions engaged in private meetings and a flurry of phone calls aimed at separating the contenders from the pretenders. \There will be a lot of candidates,\ Daley said after his first City Council meeting since announcing he would not seek a seventh term. \Look at the City Council. All 50 are candidates right now. They all want to be candidates for mayor and why not? This the best job in America, right here.\ In the anteroom behind the City Council chambers, the scene was controlled chaos as more than a dozen aldermen — white, black and Latino — happily stepped out of the meeting to give interviews to anyone who wanted to listen about how they could be the citys next mayor. But the prospective candidates — following the old political adage that its \better to be looked over than overlooked\ — werent limited to City Hall. In Washington, White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was touted by another Chicagoan, President Barack Obamas political guru David Axelrod, as having the skills and personality to be a big-city mayor. Amid all the early jockeying, bluffing and bullying, veteran Aid. Richard Mell, 33rd, outlined the nuts and bolts reality of mounting a mayoral campaign with only weeks before the Nov. 22 deadline for submitting petitions. \Someone's got to have some serious money. This isn't something you just decide,\ Mel! said. \It takes a full- scale ward-by-ward operation to identify your votes and get them out to vote.\ Mell also talked about the qualities to look for in a winning candidate — someone who will be a \unifier\ and \can't be looked at as looking at one segment of the city.\ Still, many politicians were beginning their assessment by gauging the mood of their political base. \I don't know if it's as important that it's an African-American candidate as it is about a candidate that is going to be fair to the African-American community,\ said Aid. Walter Burnett, 27th, head of the councils black caucus, which met in private at the Hotel Allegro across from City Hall. \For anyone to run for mayor of the city of Chicago there has to be a groundswell of people in the city to support them ... Everyone has an opportunity.\ At City Hall, amid the swarm of politicians and reporters, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, a South Side Democrat, said it was \critical\ to try to find an African-American contender who would work for the black communitys interests. But the councils black caucus agreed only to try to come up with a list of topics, such as improving education, that prospective candidates should address. Latino council members met for lunch and agreed to meet again within the next few weeks, giving potential candidates time to develop a presentation to make to them. \If theres a Hispanic that runs, he or she will probably get the majority of the Hispanic vote,\ said Ald. Danny Solis, 25th. \I think more than likely it probably, if you look at the numbers, it wont be a Hispanic in the runoff,\ Solis said. \But then I think we can play a very important role\ in backing one of the remaining candidates. But such sentiments didnt deter one of the citys most prominent Latino politicians from declaring that he plans to run. City Clerk Miguel del Valle told the Tribune he planned to make a formal announcement \down the road.\ Mell and many others expect the field for the February city election will be too fragmented for any candidate to reach the winning margin of 50 percent plus one vote. If there is no outright winner, the top two vote-getters proceed to an April 5 runoff election. One prominent Northwest Side committeeman, who asked not to be identified because of the early stage of the campaigns, said the measure of those candidates who are real and those who are seeking an ego boost can be measured in two numbers: 25,000 and $7 million. Though 12,500 signatures are needed for the February primary, politicians routinely get double the number to ensure they make the ballot. As for $7 million, the committeeman said, about $4 million would be needed to ensure a first or second place finish on Feb. 22, followed by a campaign of about $3 million for the April runoff. \Im getting a lot of calls about having lunch,\ said the committeeman. \Ive told them to call me back when they get the signatures and then we can talk about fundraising.\ Aid. Patrick Levar, 45th, who is not running for mayor, said this power vacuum reminds him of when Mayor Harold Washington died and Eugene Sawyer was picked to replace him. \Theres a lot of people who are going to be jockeying for position, but Ive learned over the years to sit and listen and see who can put the different coalitions together,\ said Levar, who is also the Northwest Side wards Democratic committeeman. \Whoever can raise the amount of money and put the coalition together is the person who is going to win.\ While many politicians were starting those discussions, some key Democratic committeemen said they hadnt heard from Emanuel, one of the most prominent potential candidates. Emanuel, a former top political aide to Daley and Northwest Side congressman, has previously said hed like to be mayor but has avoided the spotlight since Daleys announcement. Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One that he expected Emanuel to \take some time to think about what he wants to do with his future.\ But Axelrod, who previously served as Daleys political adviser, told ABC News that if Emanuel decided to leave the White House for a mayoral bid, \the president will support that decision.\ Saying mayors are \larger than life personalities,\ Axelrod said Emanuel \has that combination of skills and that personality and mindset to be a success if he chooses to go that route.\

C05767452	http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/feb/05/northern-ireland-police-powers-agreement Brown hails new chapter in Northern Ireland as end to years of violence Promise of US investment follows momentous agreement that seals power-sharing framework • Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent • quardian.co.uk, Friday 5 February 2010 19.11 GMT • X British and Irish PMs endorse power-sharing deal Link to this video Northern Irelands leaders have been rewarded with the promise of a new US investment programme after securing a historic deal today which saved power sharing. Gordon Brown and his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, flew into Northern Ireland to put their seal of approval on the deal, which will create a Department of Justice, gives unionists concessions on the issue of Protestant parades and saves the power-sharing executive from collapse. Brown said the achievements over the longest period of unbroken negotiations since the peace process began 16 years ago were inspirational. \This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks, weeks of stalemate.\ Tonight the White House said Barack Obama saw the deal as \an important step to greater peace and prosperity for all communities on the island.\ Obama would also meet Cowen, the DUP leader and first minister Peter Robinson and the deputy first minister, Sinn Feins Martin McGuinness, in Washington on St Patricks Day next month. Earlier, Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, said the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein was a \shining example to other parts of the world locked in religious and ethnic conflicts\. As a result of the deal, she said: \The people of Northern Ireland are poised to build a thriving society on this stronger foundation. Our economic envoy, DecIan Kelly, will continue to help Northern Ireland reap the dividends of peace, including economic growth, international investment and new opportunities. - In the near future, Declan and I will host first minister Robinson and deputy first minister McGuinness in Washington.\ The Irish prime minister said the agreement reached \presents a real opportunity to renew the partnership which is the life blood of the devolved institutions. The people of Northern Ireland yearn for this constructive partnership to deliver tangible outcomes that improve their lives.\ Referring back to the Belfast agreement of 1998, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, described todays agreement as \yet another good Friday.\ After reaching an agreement just before midnight on Thursday, the parties in the Northern Ireland assembly must now vote to put the compromise package in place. They will vote on 9 March to devolve policing and justice powers, which will then create a justice ministry on 12 April — a key Sinn Fein demand throughout these negotiations. Under the agreement, a six-member working group, appointed by Robinson and McGuinness, will formulate a framework for handling contentious marches and the phasing out of the Parades Commission. The new body will encourage local people to find solutions to parading problems, with the rights of marchers and residents taken into account. It will complete its work within three weeks, when the Northern Ireland executive will transfer responsibilities for parading legislation from Westminster and table a new bill based on the groups proposals. An executive working group will be set up, in the hands of the SDLP and Ulster Unionists, to improve the way the power- sharing cabinet is run. Robinson and McGuinness will address issues still outstanding from the 2006 St Andrews agreement that led to the DUP-Sinn Fein deals. These include legislative measures to protect the rights of Irish language speakers. Ian Paisley Jr, the North Antrim assembly member and son of the DUPs founder, described the agreement as a \win for unionism\. Paisley said his party had negotiated the end of the Parades Commission, which most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists. He added that unionist critics of the deal had \no alternative except the imposition of joint authority from London and Dublin\. Mindful of attacks on the DUP by the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice, Robinson said: \There are some who will play politics with this agreement, but the real focus in the months to come must be on building an administration at Stormont that our whole community identifies with and supports.\ Jim Allister, the TUV leader and a former DUP MEP, said he was \relishing the prospect\ of a general election contest with his former party. Allister will stand for the TUV in Ian Paisley Srs North Antrim constituency. \In football terms I see this result as a five to one win for Sinn Fein. They get their date for policing and justice. Secondly, their veto can be exercised over the justice ministry. They now have working party on Irish language. North/South bodies are strengthened. And finally there is a stronger north-south parliamentary forum. The DUP only get a view of parading issues. \Sinn Fein are laughing all the way to the next staging post,\ he said. Shaun Woodward, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the deal was bad news for republican dissidents determined to destabilise the power-sharing government. He said a powerful message was being sent out to the dissidents that there are now \two groups of people who were once terrible rivals [who] have found a way through a very big challenge\. But the Real IRA, Continuity IRA and Oglaigh na hEireann are unlikely to be moved by the accord at Hillsborough. In the past seven days the republican dissidents have carried out three gun and bomb attacks on police stations across Northern Ireland. Republican sources have told the Guardian that the groups are likely to intensify their armed campaigns when policing and justice powers are transferred to Belfast.

Sid 2010: global cracks, human prospects (part II) No• a■iid Hayes, 2 January 2010 Subjects: • Democracy and government • International politics More openDemocracy authors reflect on a volcanic decade in global politics - continued from part I openDemocracy deputy editor David Hayes asked openDemocracy writers to reflect on the decade that has passed and the one that lies ahead by considering three questions: 1)What was the most significant trend in the centurys first decade? 2) What do you most hope for, and most fear, about the decade to come? 3) What idea do you see fading and/or emerging in 2010 and beyond? • Sidney Blumenthal The greatest challenge for the early 21st century is that Chinas leadership has contempt for much of the international order and many of the international organisations developed since the second world war. In pursuit of its narrow and even crude understanding of its interest, China will constantly abuse and break international rules, protocols and bodies. Its willful destruction of the Copenhagen summit on climate change reveals the pattern. Its mercantile currency policy in a beggar-thy-neighbour approach, environmental degradation, and disdain for human rights and the rule of law generally are the obvious reflections of its despotism. Through its rough and strange neo-imperialism, in Africa especially but also elsewhere, China is able to gain help, partly through economic intimidation, in its international forays to repel or strike down the responsibilities of internationalism. Internally, China is a prison of nations, an empire similar to imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, and may also be the most unequal industrial country in distribution of income. Chinas power is increasing, but the authoritarian regime is hardly the wave of the future as some awestruck worshippers of raw power and money (whether investment bankers or ex-Marxists) imagine. The system is inherently unstable, which accounts for its rigid currency policy (at root a fear of operating on other than a virtual slave-labour standard, of turning its poverty-stricken millions into consumers with real choice, and ultimately of letting go even a little bit). In the long-term the tyranny of the one-party state and its military rule is at odds with the new economic classes of entrepreneurs and professionals it has fostered. Chinas growing economic power is accompanied by expanding arrogance, demonstrated not least in the incivility and rudeness with which President Obama was treated on his trip there. Chinas regime lacks an ideal other than a communist gloss on Confucian uniformity, itself based incoherently on reckless economic development, for example in the areas of currency, environment and labour; it has no \soft power\, not just because of the coarseness of its supposed diplomacy, but also because its cultural appeal does not travel. China forces its way through coercion of one sort or another. The next decade will see how flexible or inflexible its rulers are and how secure their system is. The brief effort at a rhetorical gesture by some in the Obama administration who floated the turgid phrase \strategic reassurance\ was risible and did not last. For now, the west has no policy to deal with China as it is. The place to begin is on currency. The most powerful idea for the 21st century is the equality of women. It is the idea most feared by those - from the Vatican to the Taliban - arrayed against modernity, the still vibrant project of the Enlightenment. Someday the United States may even have a woman president. It took fifty years after granting the vote to African-Americans to pass a constitutional amendment giving it to women. Perhaps the distance between electing the first African-American president and the first female one will not be so great.

C05769936	http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/06/the-israeli-medias-flotilla-fail/ The Israeli Medias Flotilla Fail On 06.22.10, By Max Blumenthal My summaty of the Israeli medias shambolic performance following the flotilla massacre was originally published here in Hebrew at Dvorit Shargals excellent Israeli media blog, Velvet Underground. The English version follows: If the raid of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla was a disaster for the Israel Defense Forces, its aftermath demonstrated an equally bewildering performance by the Israeli media. The IDF Spokesmans Office churned out one misleading claim after another, each one more implausible than the next, seeking to implant in the publics mind a version of events that bore little relation to reality. To a degree, this was to be expected; but it was startling to see how some of Israels most respected reporters lined up to serve as military stenographers, barely challenging the IDFs rapidly changing versions of events. IDF claims about the flotilla passengers links to Al Qaida, anti-Semitic statements shouted at the Israeli Navy, and their terrorist intentions were eagerly broadcast by the Israeli media without a second thought. When independent reporters forced the IDF to retract or \clarify\ all of these claims, Israeli news outlets refused to correct their errors, or covered them up without acknowledgment. It so happened that I arrived in Israel for a research trip the day after the flotilla raid. As a result, I was able to do something which I always thought to be a very basic journalistic practice, so basic its supposed to be applied routinely: Asking an implicated party in a story to produce evidence for its claims. What I found bewildering is that at least judging from Israeli media reports, few, if any, mainstream reporters applied this practice, and when a visiting colleague did their job for them – nobody bothered to correct or withdraw their original report. On June 2, the IDF disseminated a press release entitled, \Attackers of the IDF soldiers found to be Al Qaeda mercenaries.\ The accusation was not accompanied by any conclusive evidence — the IDF reported that Mavi Marmara passengers were equipped with night-vision goggles (gasp!). This did not stop Yedioths Ron Ben-Yishai, who was embedded with the Navy commandos, from amplifying the baseless charge. Citing an \interrogation\ of Marmara passengers — \lynchers,\ he called them — Ben-Yishai wrote the same day, \Some among the [flotilla passengers] are believed to have ties with World Jihad groups, mainly Al Qaeda.\ The article made no reference to any efforts on part of Ben Yishai to investigate this claim, nor did he seem to think to ask why the IDF was about to release dangerous operatives of Osama Bin Laden — presumably they would attack again, wouldnt they? • On June 3, Israeli journalist Lia Tarachansky of the Real News Network and I placed calls to the IDF Spokesmans Office to demand further evidence of the Marmaras Al Qaeda ties. We received identical responses from spokespeople from the IDFs Israel and North America desks: \We dont have any evidence. The press release was based on information from the National Security Council.\ Hours later, the IDF retracted its claim, changing the title of its press release to, \Attackers of IDF Soldiers Found Without Identification Papers.\ Despite the official retraction, Ben-Yishai's article remains uncorrected. On June 4, the IDF released an audio clip purporting to consist of transmissions between the Mavi Marmara and a Naval warship. \Go back to Aushwitz!\ a Marmara passenger shouted, according to the IDF. YNet and Haaretz reported on and reproduced the audio clip without investigating its authenticity. Forget that the voice uttering the anti-Semitic slur sounded like a mentally disturbed teenager; had reporters performed a cursory search of the IDF Spokeman's Office website, they would have found a longer clip released on May 31 that featured a dramatically different exchange with the Marmara with no mention of Auschwitz. Further, the voice of flotilla organizer Huwaida Arraf was featured in the \Aushwitz\ clip, yet Arraf was not aboard the Marmara (she was on the Challenger One). Could the IDF have doctored audio to exploit public hysteria surrounding the issue of anti-Semitism? On my blog, I pointed out the discrepancies in the IDF's footage and raised the question of doctoring. The next day, the IDF conceded that it had in fact doctored the footage, releasing a \clarification\ and a new clip claiming to consist of the \full\ exchange between the Navy and the flotilla. Unfortunately, the authenticity of the new clip was impossible to verify. Despite the IDF's admission, YNet and Haaretz have not corrected their original reports, though Haaretz has at least altered its headline. Once the doctoring was exposed, the New York Times covered the episode in detail, directing international attention to the triumph of independent online reporting and the apparent failure of Israel's parochial press corps. On June 7, Haaretz's Anshel Pfeffer reported on an IDF press release claiming without evidence that five flotilla passengers had links to international terror. The press release was larded with highly implausible claims, including that Ken O'Keefe, who runs an aid organization with Tony Blair's sister-in-law, was planning to train a Hamas commando unit in the Gaza Strip. When I called the IDF Spokesman's Office, I learned that once again, no evidence was available to support their press release. \There is very limited intelligence we can give in this specific case,\ Sgt. Chen Arad told me. \Obviously Im unable to give you more information.\ Did Pfeffer demand more evidence? If he did and was answered in the same manner as I did, why did Haaretz publish an unsubstantiated spin as fact? Joined by Haaretz military correspondents Avi Isacharoff and Amos Harel, Pfeffer became a channel for another daytime deception by the IDF. On May 31, the three reporters produced an article based exclusively on testimony from Naval commandos — the flotilla passengers side of the story was ignored — claiming they had faced live fire and lynching attempts from Marmara passengers. Since the story was published, the IDF has produced scant evidence to support either accusation. The article was accompanied by a suspicious photo from the IDF Spokesmans Office depicting a bearded Muslim man brandishing a knife and surrounded by photojournalists. Daylight beamed in from a window behind the man. Haaretzs caption, which was sourced to the IDF, asserted that the photo was taken \after\ the commandos had boarded the Marmara. However, the commandos raided the ship at night, while the photo was taken during the day. Once again, the IDFs story was fishy. I called Sgt. Arad at the IDF Spokesmans Office to investigate. He told me he had no evidence to support the photos questionable caption. Soon after our phone conversation, Haaretz quietly altered the caption, removing its claim that the photo was taken \after\ the commando raid. For nearly a week, the false photo caption had remained intact. Why did Haaretz suddenly change it? The only plausible explanation is that the paper received a tip from the IDF Spokesmans Office. If true, the tip-off suggests a scandalous level of coordination between the Israeli military and the countrys media. In the wake of the flotilla raid, Israeli journalists had a unique opportunity to lead the global medias investigation into the bloodbath that occurred on the deck of the Mavi Marmara. After all, no one had better access to the military or the eyewitnesses aboard the flotilla. Instead, too many among the Israeli press corps allowed themselves to be conscripted into the IDFs hapless information war, leaving the important task of investigating the raid to independent reporters who remembered to view claims by any nations military with extreme skepticism. So why do well-connected, experienced reporters follow the IDF baton so willingly, and fail to follow up when IDF claims are retracted? Is it simple bias, a desire to present their military in the best possible light, a desire so strong they abandon their duty to their readers to verify their information? Are they afraid of sanctions, of losing contacts and access to information? Do they fear personal reprisals? Their readers, and the world media that still relies on Israeli journalism as a vital source of information, need to know.

C05770549	Inept US cannot fix Afghanistan: top Saudi prince Sun, May 16, 2010 RIYADH (AFP)— An \inept\ United States cannot fix Afghanistans problems and should simply focus on \chasing the terrorists\ there, former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal said on Saturday. The ex-ambassador to the United States also challenged Washington to produce results in just-started Middle East peace talks, and accused US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of undermining efforts to make the region nuclear-free. AFP — Saudi Arabias former intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal delivers a speech during a conference ... In a speech in Riyadh before diplomats, Turki said US-led NATO troops had irrevocably alienated the Afghan people and had no hope of rebuilding the country. \What Afghanistan needs now is a shift from nation-building to effectively countering terrorists,\ Turki told the Arab News conference. US President Barack Obama \should not be misdirected into believing that he can fix Afghanistan's ills by military means.\ \Hunt down the terrorists on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistan border, arrest them or kill them, and get out, and let the Afghan people deal with their problems. \As long as GI boots remain on Afghan soil, they remain targets of resistance for the Afghan people and ideological mercenaries.\ Turki, who has long served a central role in Saudi-Afghan relations, scolded Washington's handling of relations with Kabul. \The inept way in which this administration has dealt with President (Hamid) Karzai beggars disbelief and amazement. \Both sides are now filled with resentment and a sour taste in their mouths,\ he said. \How can they both get out of that situation? I don't know.\ The chairman of the King Faisal Center For Research and Islamic Studies, Turki has no official position but is believed to often reflect high level thinking in the Saudi government. He is the brother of Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, and analysts speculate he could become foreign minister when Saud retires. Turki said Arab states have given Washington four months to show progress in US-guided Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. \The Arab world has given Obama until September to get things done,\ said Turki. \It is not enough to talk the talk. He has to walk the walk. \If he does not succeed... then I (will) ask President Obama to do the morally decent gesture and recognise the Palestinian state that he so ardently wishes to exist. \He can then pack up and leave us in peace and let the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese negotiate directly with the Israelis. No more platitudes and good wishes and visions, please.\ Turki also faulted the US and European approach in trying to halt Irans alleged efforts to build a nuclear weapon. \The discussions on Irans nuclear ambitions started off on the wrong foot. The carrot and stick approach does not work,\ he said. For one, he said, the US and Europe have had double-standards in dealing with Iran on the one hand, and other nuclear countries on the other. \You cannot ask Iran to play on one level while you allow Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea to play on other levels.\ Turki said a successful strategy toward Iran requires even-handedness, a \universal nuclear security umbrella\ for the countries in the area, and \a good military option\ against any regional country which does not cooperate. He said Clinton had undermined efforts to move toward a regional nuclear-free zone, after the UN Security Council's five permanent members recently expressed support for the idea. \Alas... Clinton then voided the issue of its value by stating that the conditions do not yet exist for establishing the zone,\ he said. \Why, then, did she join the other members of the P5 in issuing their statement?\ Turki said he hoped Obama \will find the way to correct his secretary of states nullification of making our area free of weapons of mass destruction.\ Turki also warned of rising violence in Iraq after the pullout of US troops next year, warning both internal and external groups seek to carve up the country. \Imagine what will happen once internal strife and fighting escalates\ following the US pullout, he said. Without a UN Security Council effort to protect Iraqs current borders, the consequence could be \regional conflict on a scale not seen since the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 17th and 18th centuries,\ he warned.

C05767138	See the report below: Pinera has announced his support. I had a long conversation with Craig a little while ago. He spoke with a number of people in Chile, including his close friend, According to Craig, Pinera had made the calculation that it would be politically untenable to dump Insulza. Apparently there is a coalition leadership in the lower house, and Insulzas party, Concertacion, controls the upper house. So he had no choice. That said, Craig believes that his clear message had an impact on what Pinera told Insulza. He apparently gave his support with two conditions: (1) dont interfere in Chilean politics, and (2) take the democratization agenda seriously and dont carry the ALBA countries water. Craig also said that Arturo had been effective in making clear that the jury was out on Insulza in Washington -- that had an impact on the Pinera government and reinforced their second message to him. Bottom line: Craig said we couldnt have talked Pinera off of this, but we helped drive a stronger set of conditions on Pineras support.

C05769205	HOUSTON — (March 31, 2010) - Former First Lady Barbara Bush was discharged Wednesday from The Methodist Hospital in Houston after undergoing a series of tests. Doctors believe Mrs. Bush, 84, may have had a mild relapse of her Graves disease, a thyroid condition for which she was treated in 1989. As a result, her physicians at Methodist have adjusted her medication. Upon discharge she was alert, talkative and appeared to be getting stronger as she prepared to return home. Mrs. Bush arrived Saturday at the hospital, where she received a number of tests including blood tests and imaging studies. Just over a year ago Mrs. Bush received a replacement aortic valve at Methodist, which doctors said is working very well. Mrs. Bush is expected to make a full recovery and should soon return to her normal activities.

C05762461	Yesterday, June 21, Chatham House in UK published a detailed study of the Iranian vote, concluding from close analysis that the election results were a fraud. This is the most definitive objective analysis so far.

Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Irans 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 2 Executive Summary Working from the province by province breakdowns of the 2009 and 2005 results, released by the Iranian Ministry of Interior, and from the 2006 census as published by the official Statistical Centre of Iran, the following observations about the official data and the debates surrounding it can be made. •In two conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of more than 100% was recorded. •At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased turnout and the swing to Ahmadinejad. This challenges the notion that Ahmadinejads victory was due to the massive participation of a previously silent conservative majority. •In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, all former centrist voters, and all new voters, but also up to 44% of former Reformist voters, despite a decade of conflict between these two groups. •In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas. That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth. The claim that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces flies in the face of these trends. Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Irans 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 3 1. Irregularities in Voter Turnout Two provinces show a turnout of over 100% and four more show a turnout of over 90%. Regional variations in participation have disappeared. There is no correlation between the increase in participation, and the swing to Ahm adinejad. Firstly, across the board there is a massive increase in turnout, with several provinces increasing their participation rate by nearly 75%. This increase results in substantially less variation in turnout between provinces, with the standard deviation amongst provincial turnouts falling by just over 23% since 2005. The 2005 results show a substantial turnout gap, with seven provinces recording turnout below 60%, and ten above 70%. In 2009, only two were below 70% and 24 were above 80%. In fact, 21 out of 30 provinces had turnouts within 5% of 83%. The data seems to suggest that regional variations in participation have suddenly disappeared. This makes the evident lack of any sort of correlation between the provinces that saw an increase in turnout and those that saw a swing to Ahmadinejad (Fig.1) all the more unusual. There is no significant correlation between the increase in participation for a given province and the swing to Ahmadinejad (Fig.1). This lack of correlation makes the argument that an increase in participation by a previously silent conservative majority won the election for Ahmadinejad somewhat problematic. Furthermore, there are concerns about the numbers themselves. Two provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, have results which indicate that more votes were cast on 12 June than there were eligible voters and that four more provinces had turnouts in the mid-nineties. In a country where allegations of tombstone voting — the practice200f using the identity documents of the deceased to cast additional ballots — are both longstanding and widespread, this result is troubling but perhaps not unexpected. This problem did not start with Ahmadinejad; according to official statistics gathered by the International institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Stockholm, there were 12.9% more registered voters at the time of Mohammed Khatamis 2001 victory than there were citizens of voting age. In conclusion, a number of aspects of the reported turnout figures are problematic. The massive increases from 2005, the collapse of regional variations, and the absence of any clear correlation between increases in turnout and increased support for any candidate on their own make the results problematic.

Where did Ahmadinejads New Votes Come From? According to the official Ministry of Interior voting data (see Appendix), Mahmud Ahmadinejad has increased the conservative vote by 113% compared to the 2005 election. There is little correlation in provincial level results between the increase in turnout and the swing to the President, challenging the notion that a previously silent conservative majority has come out to support him. Interestingly, in 1.0 out of 30 provinces, mainly former Mehdi Karrubi strongholds, the official data suggests that Ahmadinejad received not only the votes of all former non-voters and former Rafsanjani voters, but also took up to 44% of the vote from those who had previously voted Reformist. According to the official data1, Mahmud Ahmadinejad has received approximately 13m more votes in this election than the combined conservative vote in the 2005 Presidential election2. Assuming that Ahmadinejad retained all 11.5m Conservative votes from 2005, these additional 13m votes could have come from three sources, in descending order of likelihood: •The approximately 10.6m citizens who did not vote in 2005, but chose to vote in this election •The 6.2m citizens who voted for the centrist Rafsanjani in 2005 •The 10.4m citizens who voted for Reformist candidates in 2005 In order to examine in detail where Ahmadinejads increased support came from, the table below (Fig.3) shows the composition of the 2009 vote by province, dividing it into those who voted Conservative, Rafsanjani, and Reformist in 2005, and those who did not vote at all in 2005. It assumes that 2005 voters will vote again. The table demonstrates that in the 10 of Irans 30 provinces highlighted red, in order for the official statistics to be correct Ahmadinejad would have needed to win over all new voters, all former Rafsanjani voters, and also up to 44% of former reformist voters. 1 Serious complaints have been raised about both the 2005 elections and the 2009 elections. Government data is not perfectly reliable. 2 In 2005 there were three Conservative candidates in the first round. Ahmadinejad can reasonably be expected to have received in 2009, all votes cast for Conservatives in 2005. Here, Ahmadinejads 2009 performance is compared to the combined performance of all three Conservatives in 2005. Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Irans 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 6 It is notable that many of these are provinces where the Reformist cleric Mehdi Karrubi polled highly in 2005, and the governments figures would appear to suggest that his former supporters have not voted tactically for the likely Reformist challenger Mir Hussein Musavi, as many had expected, but rather that they have defected to the hard-line conservative incumbent Ahmadinejad. This interpretation is to some extent supported by the relationship between the percentage of former Karrubi voters in a province, and its swing to Ahmadinejad (Fig.2). To many Reformists, this situation is extremely unlikely. Mehdi Karrubi is a well-known reformist, of polar opposite views to Ahmadinejad on issues of political and cultural freedoms, economic management, and foreign policy. They allege fraud, and it is likely that the provinces where Karrubis vote has collapsed will provide the bulk of the 600+ complaints which the defeated c andidates are lodging against the conduct of the election. However, Karrubi, like Ahmadinejad, is seen as a man of the people, and Ahmadinejad is as much a re-incarnation of the Islamic Republics early hard left as he is a leader of its current hard-right. Ahmadinejads supporters thus claim that rural voters voted for Ahmadinejad in 2009 for precisely the same reasons that they voted for Karrubi in 2005. The data offers no arbitration in this dispute, although Roukemas application of statistical fraud detection techniques to the by district data has turned up some anomalies with respect to the figures for Karrubis vote,3 which may suggest that they were created by a computer. These can be followed up should the fully disaggregated by polling station data be released during the ongoing dispute. 3 B Roukena, Benfords Law Anomalies in the 2009 Iranian Presidential Election (as yet unpublished article, 2009).

Do Rural Voters Support Ahmadinejad? Many commentators have suggested, before and after the Presidential Election, that Ahmadinejad is very popular in rural areas and that this explains his high levels of support. However, the data from the 2005 Presidential election does not support this contention. Instead, it confirms that what support Ahmadinejad did gain in 2005 was mainly from urban and suburban areas. The graphs below show the levels of support for Ahmadinejad against the rural population of the province in question (Fig.4) and Conservatives as a group (Fig.5). Preliminary Analysis of Voting Figures in Irans 2009 Presidential Election www.chathamhouse.org.uk 10 Source: Ministry of Interior Publications 2005 and 2009 and Iranian Census of 2006 (see appendix) This data supports the con tention of academic experts on rural Iranian politics4 that rural voters have not been the dedicated Ahmadinejad supporters occasionally described in western media. This is supported by the fact that much of Irans rural population is comprised of ethnic minorities: Lors, Baluch, • Kurdish, and Arab amongst others. These ethnic minorities have a history both of voting Reformist and of voting for members of their own ethnic group. For example, they were an important segment of Khatamis vote in 1997 and 2001 and voted largely for Karrubi and Mostafa Moin in 2005. The 2009 data suggests a sudden shift in political support with precisely these rural provinces, which had not previously supported Ahmadinejad or any other conservative (Fig.5) showing substantial swings to Ahmadinejad (Fig.6). At the same time, the official data suggests that the vote for Mehdi Karrubi, who was extremely popular in these rural, ethnic minority areas in 2005, has collapsed entirely even in his home province of Lorestan, where his vote has gone from 440,247 (55.5%) in 2005 to just 44,036 (4.6%) in 2009. This is paralleled by an overall swing of 50.9% to Ahmadinejad, with official results suggesting that he has captured the support of 47.5% of those who cast their ballots for 4 Cf.

This, more than any other result, is highly implausible, and has been the subject of much debate in Iran. This increase in support for Ahmadinejad amongst rural and ethnic minoritiy voters is out of step with previous trends, extremely large in scale, and central to the question of why (or indeed whether) he won in June 2009.

C05766460	FYI
C05768859	sbwhoeop Wednesday, March 24, 2010 11:11 PM h: FYI, Iran document Gary Sick sent me. Sid From Gary Sick Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi is a senior adviser to President Ahmadinejad and a devoted proponent of the Divine Right of Kings doctrine of ultra-conservative ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi. Many regard him as an eminence grise of the Iranian regime and an important bridge between the Revolutionary Guards, the fanatic-fringe ayatollahs, and the presidency. So his words are worth listening to as clues to what is happening inside the closed circles of the Iranian leadership. Today he was quoted by the Fars news agency (in Persian) on the troublesome issue of U.S.-Iran relations. Although the statement was translated into English, it needs more than a word-for-word translation in order to be understood. So I have added my own interpretation of what Mojtaba really meant to say. \Obama not only did not manage to realize his slogan [of change], but has pursued the dark policies of Bush all over the world ever more energetically...\ [real meaning: Oh, how we miss George Bush! He was such an easy target. With him we were winning everywhere and Americas credibility was falling to the point of disappearance even among its friends.] \The Bush presidency is one of the darkest eras of the United States and the greatest hatred emerged internationally towards the United States...\ [Why cant Obama be more like Bush? In the good old days we didnt have to keep answering questions about why we would not accept an outstretched hand of friendship. It was all so much easier then.] \Today we see that the United States rather than moving its military forces out of Iraq and Afghanistan has increased their number which has led to mass murder of the people and increased impoverishment in these countries. Obama had said that he wanted to oppose violation of human rights and wanted to close Guantanamo and secret prisons in Europe. Did this happen? Of course not...\ [The United States has announced its withdrawal from Iraq and actually seems to be on schedule; in the meantime, our favorite parties and politicians in Iraq have not done all that well in the Iraqi elections despite our support. The Shii religious leaders in Najaf openly dismiss the idea of an Islamic Republic and are increasingly competing with us, instead of following our lead. In Afghanistan, the Americans seem to be serious about announcing a date certain for withdrawal, and they even seem to be edging up to a Karzai reconciliation strategy with the Taliban. How can we attack them with a straight face when they behave this way!] \There has also not been any correction of the dark policy of Bush towards Irans nuclear program or [the United States] opposition towards the Iranian nation...\ [Their willingness to meet with us and that dastardly offer of a uranium swap were hugely embarrassing. Now every time we sit down with a foreign leader we have to listen to tiresome suggestions that we should reconsider our position on the uranium swap — even from the Russians and Chinese. You cant trust anyone these days!] \We do not want anything from the United States. The Iranian nation demands its rights to be recognized and respected...\ [All we want from the Americans is the return of George Bush! Even John McCain would be an improvement. I wonder if Sarah Palin has any chance? Well keep our fingers crossed.] \The Islamic Republic has not become isolated, rather, it is expanding [its foreign relations] ever more and is finding new friends... if they have claims, they must show it in their actions so the Iranian nation gradually trusts them...\ [We have never been so alone since the earliest years of the revolution. Even dictators and police states are privately expressing sympathy to us for the way our crackdown on the Green Movement attracted sympathetic attention all over the world. And its all the fault of that *&!*Obama and the %$

C05765145	I've attached the gorgeous cover as a PDF Hillary's Moment: Clinton Faces the World By Joe Klein Time Magazine Wednesday, Nov. 04, 2009 It was Halloween night in Jerusalem, and Benjamin Netanyahu came dressed as a peacemaker. \Were prepared to start peace talks immediately,\ the notoriously reluctant Israeli Prime Minister proclaimed, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton standing at his side, poker-faced. \I think we should ... get on it and get with it.\ It was a ploy, of course. The Palestinians were tangled up in themselves, yet again. They had elections looming, and their leader, Mahmoud Abbas, had to hang tough: he was demanding a total freeze to Israeli settlement-building on the West Bank — which was precisely what the Obama Administration had previously said it favored. Netanyahu was offering a partial freeze, not including new settlements in East Jerusalem, the desired capital of a future Palestinian state. This was a nonstarter for the Palestinians, but it had the holographic glow of a step forward. It was an \unprecedented\ offer, Netanyahu trumpeted, with the joy of a chess master springing a trap.(See photos from 60 years of Israel.) It was a tough moment for Clinton, playing second fiddle at the Bibi-does-Gandhi show. President Barack Obama had softened his language on the settlements a few weeks earlier: instead of a total freeze, he had talked about Israeli \restraint\ in settlement-building. And now Clinton seemed to cement the Administrations retreat, agreeing that Netanyahus proposal was, indeed, \unprecedented,\ even though the U.S. still favored a total freeze. The most important thing, she added, was for the parties to get to the table as quickly as possible. The onus was back on the Palestinians — and the Palestinians quickly expressed outrage at the Obama Administrations retreat. Their Arab neighbors soon joined in, causing Clinton to backtrack two days later, telling reporters the Israeli plan \falls far short\ of U.S. expectations, although she still insisted on calling it \unprecedented,\ which was neither diplomatic nor wise. Suddenly the Obama Administration seemed wobbly on the Middle East; clearly, Clinton had been too bullish on Netanyahus proposal (which had been negotiated over months with Middle East envoy George Mitchell and was seen, privately, by the Americans as real progress). But the Administrations mission was to get the parties into peace talks without preconditions. The Israelis were now in favor of talks. The Palestinians were setting preconditions. And Clinton had violated an essential rule of her job: boring is almost always better.(See photos from the life and career of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.) Clintons Three Qualities For the past 40 years, the awkward Middle East press conference has helped define the job of Secretary of State. You go to Jerusalem or Ramallah; you stand there \guardedly optimistic\ in public; in private, you try to move a comma, but the Israelis or Palestinians move, a semicolon to block your comma. The result is almost always the same: gridlock. The breakthroughs, when they come, emanate from others. Walter Cronkite asks Anwar Sadat if hed be willing to go to Jerusalem ... and Sadat, to everyones surprise, says yes. The Israelis and Palestinians hold secret meetings in Oslo and reach what appears to be a breakthrough — theyre talking! — which then becomes another dead end. The job of Secretary of State is more thankless than glamorous; in some ways, the Department of State, a noble antique, is still trying to come to terms with the invention of the telephone. In an era when Twitter haiku-messaging rules, diplomacy moves at the speed, and requires the nuanced complexity, of literature. Power has drifted from State to the National Security Council and the Pentagon, especially in wartime. Only a few of Clintons recent predecessors have distinguished themselves. Henry Kissinger, a National Security Adviser who belatedly became Secretary of State, was Richard Nixons schizophrenic alter ego; George Shultz was a strong policy voice in the Reagan Administration; James Baker had clout because he was George H.W. Bushs best friend and a world-class dealmaker. Most of the others have been frustrated or forgettable. And yet this is Hillary Clinton were talking about — the second most popular American in the world, an eternally compelling and supremely talented character, the subject of constant speculation, a walking headline. Her very presence in the job makes it crucial once more. It is a cliché to say that by naming Clinton, Obama brought his most popular potential opponent into the tent. The conventional wisdom, too cynical by half, is that he thereby succeeded in neutering her, a theory bolstered by Clintons reticence during her first nine months on the job, with special envoys like Mitchell and Richard Holbrooke doing the heavy lifting of diplomacy. But by naming Clinton, Obama also gave her great power, which cuts both ways: if she becomes dissatisfied with her role or the Administrations policies, she can become a torpedo aimed at the Oval Office. Colin Powell had similar power and a real gripe — the Iraq war — but never used it. Clinton has no such gripe, but as the Obama Administration settles in and policy differences begin to emerge among the key players, the Powell conundrum looms: How will Clinton choose to use her power? How will Obama react if and when she does? Traditionally, the Secretary of State is judged on his or her ability to formulate policy, negotiate deals and manage the striped-pants bureaucracy. Clinton has no history as a global strategist, although her performance in the 2008 campaign indicates that she is a bit more conservative than the President, more the foreign policy realist than the Wilsonian idealist. It is also too early to judge her skill as a manager or negotiator — although her performance in Jerusalem indicates that she needs a few lessons in Middle East Haggling 101. There are, however, three qualities that could make her a memorable Secretary of State. She brings a vision of departmental reform — the need to elevate foreign aid programs to the same status and rigorous scrutiny as diplomacy — that could change striped pants into chinos in the developing world. She is also the first elected politician to hold the office since Edmund Muskie briefly did during the Carter Administration, which has enabled her to better understand and interact with the politicians who run places like Afghanistan and Pakistan. But most important, she is an international celebrity with a much higher profile than any of her recent predecessors and the ability — second only to the Presidents — to change negative attitudes about the U.S. abroad. She has the potential to become the most powerful public diplomat the U.S. has fielded in quite some time, although her performance so far, at home and abroad, has occasionally been perplexing. At home, she has often seemed tentative and deferential. In a conversation with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates aired by CNN in early October, Clintons cautious formality took a backseat to Gates brisk, humorous confidence on policy issues. Abroad, she seems far more confident, at times to the point of recklessness, as in Jerusalem. (See photos of the last days of Hillary Clintons campaign.) Independence and Candor In the last week of October, Secretary Clinton moved squarely to the center of the world stage, attempting, at the behest of her special envoys, to improve the rocky alliance with Pakistan and nudge the Middle East pugilists into talks. In the course of the trip, there were the first stray wisps of a hint that Clinton wanted to begin asserting her independence, as the Administration, facing roadblocks across the world, struggled for a firmer foreign policy tone after an opening nine months that might be called the Rodney King — \Can't we all just get along?\ — phase. During her three days in Pakistan, she ran a gauntlet of town-hall meetings and media interviews that may have been unprecedented, to use the word of the week, for a U.S. Secretary of State. The trip, planned by Holbrooke and Pakistan specialist Vali Nasr, offered an unusually subtle itinerary for a U.S. diplomatic mission. A visit to a Sufi mosque that had been bombed by Sunni extremists, for example, sent a powerful message to Pakistans moderate Islamic majority. \We saw her praying there,\ an academic named Shala Aziz told me, \and, for the first time, Im thinking, The Americans have hearts.\(See photos of the suicide bombings in Islamabad.) The big news was that Clinton allowed herself to be hammered with hostile questions from students, talk-show hosts and Pashturi elders -- and that, on occasion, she pushed back, raising incredibly sensitive issues, like why no one in the Pakistani government knew where Osama bin Laden was, even though he had been in the country since 2002. Press accounts either emphasized the embarrassment of a Secretary of State's getting pummeled or fixed on Clinton's undiplomatic bluntness. But they missed the point: her candor, her willingness to listen to and acknowledge criticism, had begun to undermine the prevailing Pakistani image of the U.S. as arrogant and bossy, more interested in having the Pakistani military fight its war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban than in having a true strategic partnership. The contrast was especially sharp after George W. Bush's eight years of unqualified support for the military dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf. \In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home,\ said Farahnaz Ispahani, a government spokeswoman and Member of Parliament. \Clintons willingness to meet with everyone, hostile or not, has made a big impression — and because shes Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it means so much more.\ Transformative Experience There are no toasts at state dinners in Pakistan, because there is no alcohol. There are opening statements, though, and Clinton's — delivered impromptu on the first night of her trip after tossing aside her notes — was surprisingly emotional. Earlier in the day, President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, had presented the Secretary with an album of photos from her first visit to Pakistan, in 1995, and a framed photo of Bhutto and her two sons with Clinton and daughter Chelsea. \It did bring tears to my eyes,\ Clinton said at the state dinner in her honor at the presidential palace, \because I so admired your wife. She gave her life ...\ She faltered then, choking up, but quickly pulled herself together, talking about the \reasons why we do what we do — to provide opportunities for all.\ Clinton's first trip to Pakistan as First Lady in 1995 had been a transformative experience for her — the beginning, I believe, of the•process that made her a plausible candidate for Secretary of State. I traveled with her on that trip; when we set off, she seemed depressed and even more private than usual. The Democrats had cratered in the 1994 congressional elections, and she had been trounced in her efforts to enact a universal health care plan. It was a very personal defeat; as Clinton traveled the country trying to sell the plan, crowds shouted her down and cursed her. Privately she admitted she was shocked by the hatred. The trip to South Asia seemed a bit of a vacation — it was Chelsea's spring break — but also a retreat to a more demure, First Lady–like role after two years as health care policy czar, although it proceeded in a decidedly wonky, Hillarian fashion. Jackie Kennedy had gone to India and famously ridden an elephant; Hillary Clinton traveled to five countries and packed her schedule with visits to NGOs. \That was the greatest trip, just unbelievable,\ Clinton says now. We were sitting in her hotel suite the day after her Jerusalem gaffe, the Secretary in an electric-blue shift rather than her usual formal jacket and pants. She was wearing glasses and appeared rather freckly without her makeup. \I guess that trip has animated and informed everything Ive done since,\ she said. She emerged from the trip reinvigorated, with a new mission. By the end of 1995, at the U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing, the First Lady had propounded a new Clinton Doctrine: \Womens rights are human rights.\(See photos of Beijing's changing skyline.) Clinton is not an easy interview. She is preternaturally cautious, a consequence of her Methodist propriety and 20 years of insane public scrutiny. She does not like to talk about herself, but she did tell me one interesting story about Bhutto. When her husband was governor of Arkansas, she and Bill and Chelsea visited London and stood on the sidewalk outside Bhutto's hotel, waiting for the then Pakistani Prime Minister to arrive. \She was wearing a yellow embroidered shalwar kameez with a chiffon scarf. I was just a fan, standing on the sidewalk with everyone else. It was the only time I ever did anything like that,\ Clinton says. When Clinton and Bhutto met formally, on the first day of the 1995 trip, they hit it off immediately, in part because Bhutto was also obsessed with the impact the Islamist tide was having on women and children. I remember asking Bhutto that day what the biggest change in her country had been over the past 25 years, and she said, \I used to be able to walk down the street wearing jeans, without a headscarf. Now I cant.\ When I asked her why, she said — bluntly — \The Saudis,\ who had been aggressively funding religious schools. Of course, Bhuttos acquiescence to, and participation in, the general corruption of the Pakistani government was part of the reason public schools were so inadequate and madrasahs became popular. (See photos from the aftermath of Benazir Bhuttos assassination in 2007.) Ironically, the rise of Sunni extremist groups like al-Qaeda has brought Clintons interests — microfinance, education and health care — to the center of national-security policy for the first time. The impetus came not from the State Department but from the military, where counterinsurgency doctrine demanded that social services in war zones - schools, justice, economic development — reinforce the militarys efforts to secure the population. As a result, there was immediate chemistry between Clinton and General David Petraeus, author of the Armys counterinsurgency manual, who became one of her prime military mentors when she served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, well before Obama made his presidential intentions known, I asked Petraeus if there was any potential Democratic candidate who understood how his mind worked, and he said, \You mean, aside from Hillary?\ It was Clinton who brought together Petraeus and Holbrooke (\my two alpha males,\ she calls them) for the first time - at her home in Washington on the Friday before the Obama Inauguration. The affection and respect she gained for the military while serving in the Senate has helped make the relationship between State and the Pentagon less fraught than usual — although Defense Secretary Gates insistence on the need for bigger State Department budgets hasnt hurt. In fact, relations with the Pentagon have gone smoother, at times, than Clintons relationship with the White House staff. Clinton was particularly irritated by the ridiculously strict vetting process that thwarted her favored candidate for USAID director, Paul Farmer, from getting the job. \It was all sorts of niggling things,\ says a Clinton adviser, \like, Farmer had at one point brought more than $10,000 in cash into Haiti. The money was for a needle-exchange program, but the amount was illegal.\ Another of Clintons military mentors, retired General Jack Keane, once told me, \I'm a Republican. I disagree with her about practically everything, but she'd make a hell of a Commander in Chief.\ There is a palpable toughness to the woman, a hard edge that contrasts with the Presidents instinctive impulse toward conciliation. One of the sharpest exchanges of the presidential campaign came when Obama accused Clinton of echoing the \bluster\ of George W. Bush after she said the U.S. would be able to \obliterate\ Iran if it used nuclear weapons against Israel. Clintons edgier tone has been evident from the start of the Administration: she took a sharper position than the President on an Israeli settlement freeze by claiming, in May, that Obama wanted \to see a stop to settlements. Not some settlements, not outposts, not natural-growth exceptions.\ And then, in Jerusalem, her use of the word unprecedented seemed a rhetorical leap beyond the No Drama ground rules.(Read \Clinton's Collateral Damage.\) The White House was not entirely thrilled with either statement. But then the White House staff is several steps removed from a negotiating process. The Palestinians are weak and divided. The Israelis have been difficult, as always: whenever Mitchell raises East Jerusalem in talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, the Israeli stands up and walks out of the room. Despite Netanyahus momentary, tactical enthusiasm for peace talks, his Likud Party has always favored the de facto incorporation of Palestinian lands into the state of Israel. Hillarys Choice The tensions between the White House and State raise a fascinating question going forward. Obama and Clinton are in substantive agreement on the Presidents diplomacy-first philosophy and on most policy issues — although neither is willing to disclose the content of their private conversations — but style often predicts substance in foreign policy; neither Obamas gauziness nor Clintons inconsistent bluntness overseas seems particularly solid. There is a growing perception that the Administrations policies have been thwarted across the board: Afghanistan is a mess, Iran seems ready to scuttle the nuclear negotiations, theres no progress in the Middle East, the Syrians and North Koreans remain recalcitrant, the Russians have been offered a freebie on missile defense, and the Chinese have been given a pass on human rights with no apparent quid pro quos. The White House argues that some progress has been made: Iran is on the defensive, and North Korea has said it will return to the six-party talks. Clinton argues, correctly, about the need for \strategic patience.\ But the only thing Obama really has to show for his efforts so far is a Nobel Prize for Potential and — no small thing — the wisdom to have refrained from doing anything so wildly stupid as invading Iraq. The President has been willing to use military force - the Predator drones that have decimated al-Qaedas leadership testify to his lack of squeamishness — but this Administration is supposed to be about the efficacy of using subtler expressions of.U.S. power. That doesnt happen overnight, but for Obamas policies to be considered a success, it has to happen sooner or later, in a way that can be explained to the public. There is also a growing sense that the Presidents inexperience is beginning to show — not in his overall policy, which represents the views of a broad, moderate national-security consensus ranging from Brent Scowcroft to John Kerry, but in his execution of the details. The Afghan strategy review has been too public and taken too long; the Middle East peace hunt has become a wild goose chase. A letter to Irans Supreme Leader is a productive gesture only if it gets a response; if it doesnt, it seems weak and supplicatory. A call for the Israelis to freeze settlements is effective only if it is accompanied by the credible threat of a reduction in aid. \You cant be seen pushing countries around — demanding [that] Israel freeze settlements, demanding that Hamid Karzai reform his government — and not get results,\ says Leslie H. Gelb, author of Power Rules. \The leaders of these countries are tough, successful politicians, and theyll begin to take you less seriously.\ (See photos from the 1979 revolution in Iran.) Clinton is unwilling to acknowledge these problems, and her staff is loath to admit her occasional mistakes. Her praise for the President is fulsome, and aides say the relationship with Obama really — really — is strong. But there are also burblings and emanations from Clintons staff and friends, Foggy Bottom body language, that suggest there is a need for the Administration to produce a second act after the Rodney King phase. And the White House is perplexed by the uncharacteristic lack of discipline indicated by Clintons occasional overseas gaffes. These tensions are well within the boundaries of normal, creative policymaking. There is absolutely no indication that the Secretary is frustrated to the point of jumping ship — or returning to politics as a candidate for governor of New York, as has been rumored. Quite the contrary, she seems intent on making history as Secretary of State. To do that, though, she will have to have the same authority at home as she has abroad. She will have to become the Presidents primary foreign policy voice. Over the first nine months of the Obama Administration, seven different Obama officials have spoken on the Sunday talk shows about foreign policy. Clinton has been on each of the Sunday shows once. \Either you have one person sending the foreign policy message, with the clear approval of the President,\ says a former Republican Secretary of State, \or there is no message.\(See photos from eight months of Obamas diplomacy.) Aides to Obama say they would like to see her on the Sunday shows more often. (Indeed, Clintons staff acknowledged that she was asked to appear two additional times but was traveling and unable to do so.) Ultimately, though, television is a metaphor for the larger questions that need to be resolved: How much can these former rivals — both extremely guarded and private people — really trust each other; and, if not Clinton, who will emerge as the Presidents alter ego on foreign policy? At this point, the strongest member of Obamas national-security team is Gates — but hes a Republican and an unlikely spokesman or presidential confidant on anything beyond Pentagon issues. General Jim Jones has settled in as National Security Adviser, but hes not a political animal — and every President needs a close foreign policy adviser who understands the intersection of long-term strategy, politics and diplomatic chess. Clintons value to the Administration was clear in Pakistan. She wowed a public so skeptical that it had been questioning the $7.5 billion in purely economic and humanitarian aid the Administration had promised. \How much damage control have you been able to do on this trip?\ asked Meher Bokhari, a television-news-show host, at the end of Clintons meeting with Pakistani women. The Secretary seemed nonplussed by the bluntness of the question. \I don't know,\ she said. \I hope some.\ Afterward, I asked Bokhari to answer her own question. \Well, this trip was long overdue,\ she said. \The Pakistani people really needed to talk to an American about our concerns — the strings attached to aid programs, the drone attacks, their history of support for the military dictatorship. And it needs to be followed up. But if you ask me about the damage control\ — she paused, thinking it through — \I'd have to say a lot. She accomplished a lot.\ In the end, though, Clintons success will be determined by whether she can expand her role beyond public diplomat. She will have to become a more sure-handed negotiator and, most important, a trusted adviser to a President who knows where he wants to go in the world but hasnt quite figured out how to get there.

And seems like you will play a more public role, which is good. (You have more credibility on both sides than anyone). Going forward, if Bibi continues to be the obstacle, you will need to fmd the ground from which you can make his politics uneasy. I think you can do that even with current concerns in Israel about US posture. But it will be easier as we rebuild trust so that our future admonitions are accepted.

Neera PO,!T1CS The Female Factor Jcw the Democrats can regain women 3 faith—and fightfor their interests. era 111\(leP1 MORE FROM TH!S AUTHOR Neera Tanden: How °barna Can Win the Battle Over the Economy What Will It Tate For the Left to Rally Behind Obama Again? Tanden: Why Liberal Dissatisfaction With Obarna Is Way Overblown Last week, as Democratic candidates across the country reached out to female voters in the final swing before Election Day. the White House released a report on how The report highlights the Obama's administration's efforts and accomplishments on behalf of .‘vomen's economic success—small business expansion that helps female business owners, jobs tax credits that help women (and lnera) find jobs, and laws to enforce equal pay for equal work„ among other initiatives. Yet the report passed with little fanfare and even less media attention—like so many other aspects of the president's remarkably pro-woman policy agenda. It's almost tragic how this agenda has fallen under the radar during Obama's first two years in office. We hear too often about abortion's controversial role in the year-long health care negotiations—but not enough about other women-centered issues that, after being promoted by activists for years, have finally made it into legislation. These go beyond the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act dramatically expanded child care provisions and Head Start. The health cafe bill contained over $i billion to support nurses visiting new and expectant mothers at home, a program that women's groups and economists alike have championed as a smart investment. An even bigger victory is the CLASS Act, also part of the health care bill, which provides a basic cash benefit to people (often women) who are taking care of the elderly at home. Yet I can probably count on my hand the number of people, including women, who actually know about these new laws. Amid the din of bad news about the economy and misinformation about health care reform, these policies don't stand a chance, sadly, of getting much media coverage. it doesn't help that the Democrats haven't done enough to shine a public spotlight on them. But they could soon be lost in an even deeper abyss: The rampant individualism and free-market fundamentalism support-ed by the Republican Party, which seems on the 1 .Drecipice of controlling -die House and possibly the Senate, could undo these initiatives entirely. What's more, the new Republiicpm wave could mute the voice of women and their most important advocates on the national stage. The Ten Parties, fueled by wealthy multimillionaires, are running extreme candidates—including women like Sharron Angie and Christine O'Donnell—who want to get rid of policies that help women the most. If the health care bill gets repealed, for instance, the new provisions for !ong-term care would go out the window, making decades worth of advocacy work moot. But the Tea Parties threaten women in other ways, too. .ff the Republicans take back the _House, the Democratic Party will lose one of its most powerful women: Speaker Nanc, „' Pelosi, who currently has more clout than any woman on the other side of the aisle, Meanwhile, Republicans like Sarah Palin and Nikki Haley will only gain political power—and, with that .power, attract more attention to their extreme views. If these Republicans become the nation's loudest voices of seemingly strong women, that could portend for a shift among younger women's allegiances toward the Republican Party and its platform. Already, despite the stark realities about what Republicans will likely take away from women once. they are in power, we are seeing rumbling of such a change: After forming the backbone of Democratic majorities for years, working-class women are wobbling in theii support the the Obama administration. According to a fron. last week, while femaie college graduates savor Democratic over Republican control (56 percent to 36 percent), women With only some college or a vocational education are running almost even k A • ' Perhaps, in their growing economic anxiety, this group of women wafits to throw out incumbents they perceive have not sufficiently focused on their economic progress. But, of course, if the media paid more attention to Obama's pro-woman agenda—and both advocates and policymakers did more to broadcast it—these key voters would know that the Democrats, not Republicans, are the politicians who have their interests in mind. Democrats can't let this continue—they can't allow Republicans to brand themselves as the party of strong female leaders, or allow women to gradually become a constituency of the right. That's why it's critical to have standout women in the party. If Pelosi loses, is there a powerful enough Democratic woman to compete with these Republicans in the national spotlight? There's Hillary Clinton who, as Secretary of State, has sent a powerful signal to the country and the world about the importance of female leadership in the Obama administration, But, as a technically non-partisan international figure, Hillary won't be able to do public battle with the rising right, Perhaps a Governor Sink—if she wins—in Florida could be among a new class of strong female Democrats. The °barna administration would also do well to elevate v.,/onien in the exe.cutive branch and turn public attention to those who are already there. In addition to •presenting women as the face of the patty, Democrats must focus on issues like long-term care, child care, and equal pay, all of which could rise to the legislatle fore in the coming months. Republicans will likely directly attack or cut beck investments in these initiatives. When this happens, the White House (and Democrats more broadly) would be wise to e.:;olain what ili niean for women if these i • nitiatives are gutted or lost—and to fight tooth and nail to make s-a•.e that doesn't happen. If it doesn't take these steps, the Democratic Party could lose ts grasr on a cr3-ni‘al. Pveii central 7-,eit of its coalition.

She was instrumental in bringing FINCA to Kyrgyzstan and when you made your trip there you saw what a difference it was making to lift up women and their families. She also was her country's head of delegation to Beijing. She was foreign minister at the time and made a strong statement about gender equality and the transformative power of microcredit. I think she had an overseas post when you visited Kyrgyz so I don't think you met her.

C05767777	Google has been wierd about this whole deal but this whole Espo experience has been fascinating. Some companies will say absolutely no for months (Qualcomm, Bloomberg, J&J) and then pop out of nowhere and say yes. Others like AU are in for nd then decide not to give us a penny. Therefore we have to keep bugging these guys. We WILL raise the money. We are at $54M+ (this wk Hawaii came in for $500k and Bloomberg LLC and need $7M more. Ideally we would like to raise $10 to 11M to cover any overruns (it's getting more expensive because the US was so late we are paying more now to build it quicker). Where it will come from? A- Right now we have three big companies talking to us in the range of Haier may go from If two or three come thru big we are done. each - Monsanto, Disney, and Oracle. B- We also have a number of other companies like Invitrogen, Hormel, Mattel and Major League Baseball in the range. C-Interestingly the cities and states are going to their private funders and trying to raise money on their own to promote their jurisdictions - Chicago, Houston, Georgia, Montana, TN. (In the past, over 20 states participated with public funds but current budgets are tough). Maybe a chat w Mayor Bloomberg would be worthwhile. For example, I spoke to the University of WA and they will probably get benefactors to cosponsor at $250k making them the only university represented. D-We have approached groups like Pharma and the fashion industry thru Diane von Furstenburg to get them to bundle smaller companies and both have agreed to do it. I met w DVL and she wants you to know that she is very excited about helping (they are in therM range). E- We have talked to the elusive Chamber of Commerce again about getting SME's to raise $2-3M in smaller increments. They are contemplating it. Finally the two obvious industries that are not involved are the banks (and we know why) and the insurance companies who are starting to look into the market over there. Anyway, I did not mean to go on and on but that's where we stand and these are the potential areas to tap. We'll get there. On your last Q - I too heard that

C05767969	sbwhoeop Friday, March 5, 2010 9:52 AM H: More trouble for Tories and Cameron. He needs to support NI peace, not another problem. Sid March 5, 2010 New blow for Tories as lead slips in marginals By Nigel Morris and Michael Savage Poll shows crumbling support in target seats as David Cameron is drawn into Ashcroft non-dom row The Conservative lead is crumbling in the crucial marginal seats that David Cameron is relying on to deliver general election victory for the party, a poll last night disclosed. The result was a fresh setback for the Tory leader after a torrid day in which he was drawn deeper into the row over the billionaire peer Lord Ashcroft, when it emerged that he had known for less than a month that Lord Ashcroft had maintained his non-dom tax status for 10 years. The chances of the party drawing a line under the controversy were also wrecked by the announcement that Lord Ashcroft will be summoned to the Commons to explain why he negotiated a secret deal to enter the House of Lords without paying tax in this country on his overseas fortune. With Gordon Brown expected to announce the election date this month, senior Tories have put a brave face on their sliding support in national opinion polls since the turn of the year. They insisted they were performing much more strongly in marginal constituencies where the drive for votes has been masterminded and substantially funded by Lord Ashcroft. The YouGov poll for Channel 4 News found the Tory lead in 60 Labour-held marginals had shrunk from seven to just two points over the past year. The slide in Conservative support is further evidence Britain could be heading for a hung parliament after the election expected on 6 May. The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent (down four points since last year) and Labour on 37 per cent (up one). YouGov calculated that the results would leave the Tories the largest party after the election, but 11 seats short of an overall Commons majority. An investigation by The Independent last week found the Tories spent £6m over two years in the marginal battlegrounds, in most cases far outspending Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The party faces the daunting challenge of capturing 117 seats to achieve a majority of just one - a task described by a shadow cabinet member as a \mountain to climb\. The Conservatives received some good news yesterday when an 18-month inquiry by the Electoral Commission concluded that the £5.1m they received in donations from Bearwood Corporate Services, controlled by Lord Ashcroft, were legal. The party would have faced having to pay the money back had the electoral watchdog reached the opposite conclusion. However, the commission added its regret that the Tories refused to agree to interviews and that Lord Ashcroft had destroyed documents relating to the ownership of the company.

C05766420	Gordon Brown called Lou Susman a short while ago. Brown believes you should make a call to McGuinness this morning around 830 am (Declan and I agree that if you call McG you also must call Robinson). Brown proposes to speak with you at 820 or so to bring you up to speed before those calls. The current situation is that Brown and Cowen are in Belfast, and met with Robinson, McGuinness, and other parties until 330 in the morning Belfast time. They have now resumed today. The sticking point is parades. Robinson wants the current parades commission abolished because it gives Republicans too much say. McGuinness refuses to allow the parades issue to be tied to the devolution issue. The key message to McGuinness is to keep working this thing through -- not to take any drastic action that would bring down the assembly or collapse the process. Declan agrees that this is the moment to make calls. If you agree we can have the ops center set up the Brown call as well as the other two. We'll get you some more background before the calls, but talking points will be fluid and shaped in large measure by Brown's report.

C05771695	sbwhoeor Sunday, September 19, 2010 11:18 PM H: Richard Medley has sent this around in his private newsletter. Sid US Election And The Fed Welcome To The New (Old) World September 19, 2010 One of the main debates inside senior Fed offices is how much they may have to balance a much more conservative fiscal policy if the Republicans take over. This is the most important question facing officials on both sides of the fence (far more than squiggles and whirls of monthly numbers). But it's not just spending and taxes, important as they are, it's also implementation of Reg Reform and Health Care Reform. All of that is going to change after November. Here are the details. Amid the snarkiness about how crazy the Tea Party candidates may be (and, as you know, we LOVE snarkiness) two things should not be lost: 1. The President has lost control of the spending and tax agenda 2. The President has lost control of implementing the Reg Reform and health care legislation Congress pushed through. All polling from both parties and independent sources point strongly to the Republicans taking over the House. Although they are less likely to take over the Senate, they will be able to gain effective control of spending, taxes and large scale administrative reforms. Let's start with spending: The basic fact is that all spending has to be approved by Congress and it starts with the House. As we wrote nearly a week ago, House Republican Leader Boehner and his senior staff have made it clear to us that they would like to freeze spending at 2008 levels with an annual cost savings of $340 billion. This will be one of the top Republican priorities. Freezing spending at 2008 levels will not happen. However, even in the unlikely event the Republicans do not take over the House the budget will -- at most -- be frozen at or near FY 2010 levels (i.e. the last time money was formally appropriated). Since there have been no spending bills approved and the fiscal year starts in October, the Congress has to pass a \continuing resolution\ that keeps the government running until specific appropriations are made (the 1995 government shutdown happened because there were no appropriations and no continuing resolution...the government literally runs out of spending authority). Congress will pass a CR in the next few weeks and it will most likely run through the formation of the new Congress (say February or March) next year. They could only do it through the lame duck session, but that would be cutting it close and too cute. Because the new Congress - even if the Republicans fail to take full control of the House - will be dominated by fiscal conservatives, Boehner's CR idea will have traction. The Senate will make it more moderate, but then it will be up to the President to veto it and thus shut down government or sign it and take the hit. In turn that does two things: (1) it frees up money for the Bush tax rollovers and (2) it helps the plan to slow or freeze implementation of the reg reform and health care reform bills. The first part is obvious. The second may be less so. People forget that implementation of these rules requires staff increases, staff reg writing, etc and that's money. By freezing spending at previous levels you freeze the ability to hire new staff and you seriously obstruct the new rule writing process. Add to that Boehner's commitment to overturn the two major regulatory reforms and you've got a tidal wave of indecision and paralysis (Jesus, talk about mixed metaphors although it would be interesting to see one of those). The hearings he will announce and simply the chilling effect of him threatening to overturn the laws will accomplish ninety-percent of what he wants to get done, and potentially give the courts time to strike down parts of the health care bill now under appeal. THE SENATE While everyone has written off Republican control of the Senate (we haven't), the attention should be on what the Senate will look like even if the consensus of 52-54 Democratic majority prevails. The point is how the US Senate will function in January 2011 given its new membership. We got a glimpse of what this would look like when moderate Republican Scott Brown was elected and the health care public option was panned and Reg Reform was trimmed around the edges. The incoming crop of members are much more ardent on government spending, the debt, taxes and regulatory oversight. They will make Boehner's job much easier Take a quick look at the new members (and the several they will marry up with once they are sworn into office). While some of these candidates are replacing Republican open seats, all of them are generally considered more conservative than their predecessors: 1. ck (CO) - likely winner 2. Toomey (PA) - likely winner 3. Rubio (FL) - likely winner 4. Ayotte (NH) - likely winner 5. Blunt (MO) - likely winner 6. Portman (OH) -likely winner 7. Coats (IN) - likely winner 8. Paul (KY) - likely winner 9. Miller (AK) - likely winner 10. Lee (UT) - likely winner 11. Boozman (AR) - likely winner 12. Hoeven (ND) - likely winner 13. Kirk (IL) - 50/50 (lean GOP) 14. Angle (NV) - 50/50 tossup There are several other Democrat-controlled seats that remain in play (CA, WI, WA, and CT). These races continue to develop and we will report more as the picture on Election Day becomes clearer. These likely new members will join the following traditional budget trouble-makers in the US Senate: 1. DeMint (SC) 2. Coburn (OK) 3. Inhofe (OK) 4. McConnell (KY) 5. Kyl (AZ) 6. McCain (AZ) 7. Thune (SD) 8. Crapo (ID) 9. Vitter (LA) 10. Burr (NC) One aggressive Senator can slow the body to a snail's pace, and Republicans operated efficiently as a minority party with only 41 votes total. In January, there will be at least 22 new and existing serious road blocks now patrolling the Senate Floor. The Republican pick-ups will make getting to 60 votes for cloture impossible on spending bills. Welcome to the new reality.

C05768838	BEIJING, April 29 (Reuters) - A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported on Thursday, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks. Xu Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province on Thursday morning, attacking the children with a 20 cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added. Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added. The attack is the fourth reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child. A man stabbed 16 students and a teacher at a primary school in southern China on Wednesday, the same day that a former doctor was executed for stabbing to death eight school children last month. \More concrete measures should be taken to make school the safest place,\ a commentary in today's Beijing News said, calling for more serve punishment for these killers. Some Chinese people have taken to the Internet to discuss the root causes of the increasing number of school tragedies

C05761859	Rooney) June 6,2009 11:30am Rooney (x7-7203, CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY Thursday, June 11, 2009 This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and political stability; and declare the Administrations commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of partners. Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance down the road. The speech could be framed as follows: THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable story: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high-yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which devastates crops across Africa. Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify, and market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists. A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE Dr. Ejetas work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive. In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last years food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political stability is threatened. 44 To date, the worlds primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution. The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources. We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals. THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH Weve identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach. • Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to purchase them, and the training to use them. • Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to connect small farmers to markets. • Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right adaptations for the changing environment. • Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists. • Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide. • Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment. • Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the worlds farmers are women, but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities future. A PREVIEW OF WHATS TO COME In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who have been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The Presidents conversations at the G-8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa in August. Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration. CONCLUSION You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational approach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several African nations. 45 June 6,2009 11:30 Rooney (x7-7203, CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY Thursday, June 11, 2009 This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and political stability; and declare the Administrations commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of partners.

This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration. CONCLUSION You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational approach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several African nations. June 6, 2009 11:30am Rooney (x7-7203, CONCEPT NOTE FOR WORLD FOOD PRIZE CEREMONY Thursday, June 11, 2009 This speech is an opportunity to signal the urgency of the problem of global hunger; connect it to an array of global issues, including economic development, health and education, expanding opportunity for women, and political stability; and declare the Administrations commitment to tackling hunger at its roots, through effective and efficient collaboration with an array of partners. Additionally, your remarks can point to a shift from past approaches by emphasizing the need to support local solutions and focus on long-term sustainability to help people feed themselves and reduce the need for emergency assistance down the road. The speech could be framed as follows: THE PRIZE AND PRIZE-WINNER You can begin by announcing the winner of the 2009 World Food Prize, Dr. Gebisa Ejeta. He has a remarkable story: born in a mud hut in Ethiopia, he got his PhD from Purdue University in plant breeding and genetics and developed strains of sorghum that are drought-tolerant, high- yield, and resistant to the Striga weed, which devastates crops across Africa. Outside the lab, he helped start the Sudanese commercial seed industry; developed systems to produce, certify, and market hybrid seeds; and educated farmers about the use of fertilizers and soil and water conservation. And he has trained and inspired the next generation of African agricultural scientists. A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH: FROM LAB TO FARM TO MARKET TO TABLE Dr. Ej etas work reflects the breadth of this issue and the comprehensive approach needed to address it—one that connects the labs where new seed technologies are developed.., the fields where small-scale farmers labor to feed their families and make a living.., the markets where food is bought and sold... and the homes where people get the nourishment they need to thrive. In many places, that food chain is broken. One billion people worldwide woke up hungry this morning and will go to sleep hungry tonight. Chronic hunger threatens health, while making it harder for people to work and students to learn, which in turn stunts economic development. Last years food riots demonstrated that when food is scarce, political stability is threatened. To date, the worlds primary response to hunger has been to send emergency food aid. While this saves lives, it is a short-term fix, and we need a long-term solution. The Obama Administration is committed to leading in developing a new global approach. We will support the creation of sustainable agricultural systems in appropriate regions around the world, to increase agricultural productivity, create jobs, strengthen economies, and protect natural resources. We will do this not by imposing one-size-fits-all solutions, but by assisting countries in carrying out individual strategies that meet their needs—for example, through the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan. To facilitate coordination and share best practices, we will seek to convene donor governments, multilateral institutions, NG0s, private companies, foundations, universities, and individuals. THE ANCHORS OF OUR APPROACH Weve identified seven anchors that secure sustainable agriculture systems. These will guide our approach. • Increase agricultural productivity by expanding access to quality seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, the credit to purchase them, and the training to use them. • Stimulate the post-harvest sector by improving the storage and processing of food and improving transportation to connect small farmers to markets. • Maintain natural resources so the land can be farmed well into the future and we can make the right adaptations for the changing environment. • Expand knowledge and training by support R&D and developing the next generation of agriculture scientists. • Increase trade so small-scale farmers in developing countries can sell their crops far and wide. • Support policy reform and good governance, because sustainable agriculture flourishes in a clear and predictable policy and regulatory environment. • Support women and families in agriculture. Seventy percent of the worlds farmers are women, but most of the programs that offer credit and training to farmers target men. This must change for agriculture to thrive. And children must have nutrition to contribute to their communities future. A PREVIEW OF WHATS TO COME In the coming weeks, President Obama, Secretary Vilsack and I will be reaching out to share our approach to global coordination and agriculture in greater detail. We will seek the input, wisdom and guidance of those who have been working so long in this arena—from the Congress to NGOs to academics to foundations to the private sector. The Presidents conversations at the G- 8 meeting in Italy in two weeks will address our approach, as well as my trip to Africa in August. Addressing hunger and food is essential to achieving economic recovery, stabilizing societies, and expanding opportunity for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This is why supporting sustainable agriculture worldwide will be a central element of foreign policy in the Obama Administration. CONCLUSION You can circle back to the story of Dr. Ejeta to close. He represents the need for a multinational approach: born in Ethiopia, educated in the United States, advised by Indian scientists, advisor to several African nations.

Some 1100 rapes are being reported each month, with an average of 36 women and girls raped every day.\. Triple checking the origins. Hillary Clinton Pledges to Banish Sexual Violence Originally posted Friday August 21, 2009 12:30 PM EDT Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may be taking some well-earned R&R in Bermuda this week, but last week, the former First Lady and U.S. Senator wrapped up a grueling seven-nation diplomatic mission to Africa. While much was made back home about her snapping at a Congolese student who asked her about Bill Clintons thoughts on a trade issue (\My husband is not the secretary of state, I am,\ she retorted), the emotional heart of her tour was also her most dangerous stop — in Goma, inside the war zone in eastern Congo, where she tearfully met rape victims on Aug. 11.In this exclusive Op-Ed piece for PEOPLE.com, Secretary Clinton shares what she learned on her visit - and what she will do about it. What I Saw in Goma By Hillary Rodham Clinton In 11 days of travel across Africa, I saw humanity at its worst — and at its best. In Goma last week, I saw both. The Mugunga Internally Displaced Persons Camp sits in a land of volcanoes and great lakes on the edge of Goma, a provincial capital in the eastern Congo. The camp is now home to 18,000 people seeking refuge from a cycle of violent conflict that has left 5.4 million dead since 1998. Chased from their homes and villages by armed rebels and informal militias, these men, women and children walked for miles with little food or water until they reached this relatively safe haven. Now they live in tents, one next to the other, row after row, some clinging to life, others hanging on to whatever glimmer of hope remains in a region plagued by years of brutality. Many of these people have been robbed of their homes, possessions, families and, worst of all, their dignity. Women and girls in particular have been victimized on an unimaginable scale, as sexual and gender-based violence has become a tactic of war and has reached epidemic proportions. Some 1,100 rapes are reported each month, with an average of 36 women and girls raped every day. I visited a hospital run by the organization Heal Africa and met a woman who told me that she was eight months pregnant when she was attacked. She was at home when a group of men broke in. They took her husband and two of their children and shot them in the front yard, before returning into the house to shoot her other two children. Then they beat and gang-raped her and left her for dead. But she wasnt dead. She fought for life and her neighbors managed to get her to the hospital — 85 kilometers away. I came to Goma to send a clear message: The United States condemns these attacks and all those who commit them and abet them. They are crimes against humanity. These acts dont just harm a single individual, or a single family, or village, or group. They shred the fabric that weaves us together as human beings. Such atrocities have no place in any society. This truly is humanity at its worst. But there is reason to hope. We have seen survivors summon the courage to rebuild their lives and their communities. We have seen civic leaders and organizations come together to combat this appalling scourge. And we have seen health care workers sacrifice comfortable careers so they can treat the wounded in Goma, I met doctors and advocates who work every day to repair the broken bodies and spirits of women who have been raped, often by gangs, and often in such brutal fashion that they can no longer bear children, or walk or work. Caregivers like Lyn Lusi, who founded Heal Africa in Goma, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, who founded the Panzi hospital in Bukavu, represent humanity at its best. The United States will stand with these brave people. This week I announced more than $17 million in new funding to prevent and respond to gender and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We will provide medical care, counseling, economic assistance and legal support. We will dedicate nearly $3 million to recruit and train police officers to protect women and girls and to investigate sexual violence. We will send technology experts to help women and front-line workers report abuse using photographs and video and share information on treatment and legal options. And we will deploy a team of civilian experts, medical personnel and military engineers to assess how we can further assist survivors of sexual violence. While I was in the DRC, I had very frank discussions about sexual violence with President Kabila. I stressed that the perpetrators of these crimes, no matter who they are, must be prosecuted and punished. This is particularly important when they are in positions of authority, including members of the Congolese military, who have been allowed to commit these crimes with impunity. Our commitment to survivors of sexual and gender-based violence did not begin with my visit to Goma, and it will not end with my departure. We are redoubling our efforts to address the fundamental cause of this violence: the fighting that goes on and on in the eastern Congo. We will be taking additional steps at the United Nations and in concert with other nations to bring an end to this conflict. There is an old Congolese proverb that says, \No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come.\ The day must come when the women of the eastern Congo can walk freely again, to tend their fields, play with their children and collect firewood and water without fear. They live in a region of unrivaled natural beauty and rich resources. They are strong and resilient. They could, if given the opportunity, drive economic and social progress that would make their country both peaceful and prosperous. Working together, we will banish sexual violence into the dark past, where it belongs, and help the Congolese people seize the opportunities of a new day.

In 2002, Max wrote this report from Juarez, the first report by an American from the scene, winning the Annenberg Online Journalism Award, the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize. • &It:script language=\JavaScript\ type=\text/javascript\&gt; document.write(&Ita href=\http://clk.atdmt.com/CNT/go/197071989/directwi.728;hi.90/01/\ target=\ blank\&gtAltimg src=\http://view.atdmt.com/CNT/view/197071989/direct;wi.728;hi.90/01/\/&gt;&it ;/a&gt;); &It:/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&Ita href=\http://clk.atdmt.com/CNT/go/197071989/direct;wi.728;hi.90/01/\ target=\ blank\&gtAltimg border=\0\ src=\http://view.atdmt.com/CNTIview/197071989/direct;wi.728;hi.90/01/\ /&gt;El tia&gt;&lt:/noscript&gt; http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2002/12/04/juarez/print.html Day of the dead More than 325 women have been murdered in the free-trade boomtown of Ciudad Juarez in the past decade. Faced with government incompetence and corruption, people are rebelling. By Max Blumenthal Dec 4, 2002 I The body of another murdered woman was found late last month in the Mexican industrial hub of Ciudad Juarez, dumped behind some shrubs in the squalor of the Anapra neighborhood, a ramshackle hodgepodge of corrugated tin and cardboard shacks on the sludge-washed banks of the Rio Grande. Her hands had been tied, and the evidence suggested she had been raped. The body was so badly decomposed that investigators calculated that shed been dead for seven months. However horrific the details, they were numbing in their familiarity. The body of a woman who had died in similar circumstances was found in the same dusty lot a couple of months earlier. The bodies of eight women were found in a lot not far away a little more than a year ago. So many women have been murdered here in the past 10 years that there is no reliable count. Most experts place it close to 325, an average of 32 a year, nearly three every month. At least 90 of the deaths are believed to be the work of one or more serial killers. Hundreds more women have simply vanished. Like so many of the others, the woman whose body was found in late October had probably come to Juarez from the poverty of southern Mexico to work for about $10 a day in one of the many foreign-owned assembly plants known as maquiladoras that sprouted up in Juarez after the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994. And like them, too, her body was unclaimed in death and buried alone and anonymous. Such death has become a way of life here. So, too, with the fear and paranoia that rise in such a climate. Nobody knows who is doing the killings, and the mystery only seems to deepen. Arrests made by local authorities have produced allegations of torture, witness tampering and frame-ups -- but no convictions. Most here believe that the killer or killers must have enormous clout. Perhaps, some say, the killers are narcotrafficantes disposing of witnesses. Perhaps they are the sons of the wealthy and powerful indulging in sick sex. Perhaps they are cultists whose members come from the highest levels of government and finance. The theories differ, but a common assumption is that arrests made thus far are only a smokescreen for an historically opaque and corrupt government that will protect its dark secrets at any cost. One thing seems clear: The murders arise from a social landscape that has been transformed by global economic forces. Where Ciudad Juarez was once a small, sleepy desert outpost just across the border from El Paso, Texas, the population in the past decade has exploded to 1.2 million people, many of them drawn by the lure of the maquiladoras. The tides of people have overwhelmed the ability of the city to absorb them, overwhelmed health services, social services and law enforcement. Free-trade advocates once promised that NAFTA would transform Juarez into the City of the Future -- and they have been proven right in a way they never could have imagined. Today, Juarez still has the feel of the lawless Old West, but with a grim 21st century edge. Despite promises of swift justice from Mexican President Vicente Fox and Chihuahua Gov. Patricio Martinez, they have yet to take up offers of assistance from the FBI; bureau agents in Texas have suggested that official corruption is hindering efforts to stop the murders. Chihuahua state investigators have seemingly adopted a \dont ask, dont tell\ policy towards Juarezs homicides, fostering an atmosphere of impunity and pervasive fear. Foreign corporations operating in Juarez that have employed many of the murdered women largely deny that such an atmosphere exists. But in this postmodern urban culture, where the very concept of community has broken down, many bereaved family members and local activists have begun to take matters into their own hands, investigating the murders and speaking out even if it means threats and other reprisals. Evangeline Arces daughter, Silvia, a street vendor, disappeared on Nov. 3, 1998. Since that day, she said, the authorities have done little to investigate. \Two days after my daughter disappeared, I went to the police and filed a report,\ the mother says in Spanish, her face flaring with anger. \They promised me prompt action but when I checked back a week later, the Missing persons report was never filed and the investigation had not even begun. When they finally got witnesses together, none of them would talk because they were too afraid.\ Even as Mexico continues to make strides toward becoming an open and democratic society, the epidemic of rape and murder here has exposed the heavy residue of its corrupt and authoritarian political legacy as well as the contradictions of its efforts at economic expansion. To understand the magnitude of the breakdown, think of the sniper rampage in the Washington area this fall that left 10 people dead and three wounded. Imagine that Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose held a press conference and asked local citizens to catch the sniper themselves because local police were not up to the task and the federal government was not being helpful; imagine that the federal government charged that local officials in Montgomery County were complicit in the killings and impeding the investigation. Chaos would ensue, certainly. But then, multiply. the number of victims by 30, by 40, by 50, or more. Thats Juarez today. The jumbled, exhaust-choked commercial core of this city has grown wildly in the wake of NAFTA, adding modern shopping malls, condominiums and expansive boulevards. The population is growing at twice the rate of the national average; it is expected to nearly double by 2010, to 2 million people. Many of them directly or indirectly rely on the 300 or so maquiladoras for their livelihoods. To accommodate the new army of workers, the city has given birth to entirely new sectors. The Campestre Juarez is a luxurious conglomerate of gated communities, with a main gate thats a life-size replica of Paris Arc de Triomphe. Nearby, many of the maquiladoras are situated along the Avenida de la Industria. Though the assembly-line workers sometimes can be glimpsed behind a plate glass window in aqua-blue uniforms, there usually is little sign of any activity behind the maquiladoras featureless walls. Most of the new residents are poor, or on the brink of poverty, and they live in Anapra or another of the grim, violent colonias populares on the outskirts of town. In those colonies, residents usually live without sanitation, running water, electricity or paved roads. Avenida Manuel Gomez Morin is the pothole-riddled six-lane avenue that ties these varied worlds together. Sitio Colosio Valle, a medium-sized strip mall, stands on a corner of the avenue at the gateway to the industrial sector. It is fronted by a vast parking lot and inside are various clothing outlets and boutiques. By day, the lot bustles as customers scurry back and forth, hauling their purchases to their cars -- a sight similar to any mall in the suburban United States. By night, however, traffic tapers off, stores lock up and the malls lot becomes dark and desolate. Sitio Colosio Valle was where many of the slain and missing women were last seen. In the malls parking lot, Braulio Rosas, a 40-year-old security guard, leans against the door of a giant Nike outlet. Inside the store, under bright fluorescent lights, employees frantically check inventory and scramble to close up. \A lot of girls were picked up here,\ Roses says in a voice of calm resignation. \But really, its the girls fault. Its because even though they werent putas, [prostitutes] you know, they were more like fad/es [easy women]. They didnt have to get into those cars if they didnt want to.\ Rosas sounds cynical, but blaming the victims is by no means an aberration in Juarez. Similar notions have been offered by officials like Suly Ponce, the former Chihuahua special prosecutor in charge of the murdered womens cases. \Sometimes there are cases that a girl meets some person, he strikes up a relationship with her, they drink ... and it ends violently,\ she told the Washington Post in 2000, before she was promoted to a job in the governors office. \Its difficult to know.\ A handful of the women found murdered since 1993 were indeed confirmed as prostitutes. But the truth is that a large majority of the missing or murdered women were hardworking, young, poor and for the most part socially conservative. Most had migrated to Juarez from Mexico's depressed south to work in the maquiladoras, sometimes arriving alone and with little means of contacting their families back home. The maquiladoras, run by companies like Delphi and RCA Thomson, prefer to hire young women for assembly-line jobs. An entry-level assembly-line worker makes minimum wage, about $2 an hour. With experience, pay can rise to as much as $2,50 an hour -- and compared to wages in Guerrero or Chiapas, that's good money. But in Juarez, the women are caught in an economic trap: Since the cost of living here is only slighter lower than in El Paso, the wages that seem so high to new maquiladora workers actually ensure poverty. The workers can be hired and fired on the spot, with little pretext and no legal protection. And union activities are prohibited. Even for those who accept the conditions, security is elusive. More often now, the global companies that own maquiladoras are closing up shop and transferring operations to China to take advantage of lower taxes, investment subsidies and outrageously cheap labor. On June 29, Royal Philips Electronics announced it was moving its P.C. monitor manufacturing operations, at a cost of 900 jobs. On July 1, Scientific Atlanta fired 1,300 workers after shutting its plant down. According to the Nov. 5 New York Times, this trend has cost Juarez 287,000 jobs in the maquiladoras since their peak in October 2000. Not only does this slash and burn the economic base. There are brutal social reverberations, too. The city's health system, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, has reported 200,000 people falling from its list of insured after losing their company policies, according to a July article in La Prensa. Esther Chavez Cano, director of Juarez's only battered- women's shelter, Casa Amiga, said in a speech this summer that domestic violence cases had risen by 50 percent in July alone. The combination of poverty and a lack of social connections renders women on the assembly line powerless and virtually invisible. And that has made them easy prey. According to the El Paso Times, about a third of the approximately 325 slain women were employed by maquiladoras at the time of their murder. Given that few of the maquiladoras provide shuttle service to and from the colonies, the female workers often are preyed upon while walking through perilous places like Sitio Colosio Valle in the darkness of the early morning. At such an hour, the only nearby activity is that of bars and nightclubs closing up as male patrons filter into the street after a long night of drinking. Besides China's attractive economic climate, an intangible cause of maquiladora flight is Juarez's chronic violence. The effect is difficult to measure. Two companies in the city's industrial sector -- including TDK, the audio tape maker -- have posted banners on their factories reading: \STOP THE VIOLENCE. To Better Our City, Lets Unite.\ But most foreign companies are purely economic organisms governed entirely, it seems, by the dictates of efficiency. They have maintained a stunning silence even as their female workers are slaughtered. Consider the case of 17-year-old Claudia !vette Gonzalez. Her body was found in November 2001 along with seven others in an overgrown cotton field on Avenida Technologico, just blocks from Sitio Colosio Valle mall and across the street from the offices of the Association of Maquiladoras. She had worked on the assembly line for the Lear Corp., a Detroit-based auto-interior supplier. Lear has declined to publicly address Gonzalezs murder. Greg Bloom, editor of the Frontera Norte Sur -- an Internet news service that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border -- recalled a conversation with Gonzalezs mother, Josefina, in which she recounted her daughters last day. In the darkness of the early morning, Gonzalez told him, Claudia set out for her job at Lear. When she arrived at work a few minutes late after missing her bus, Claudia lvette was promptly sent away under a policy barring tardy assembly-line workers from their shifts. A half-hour past when she usually would have returned home, her mother knew something was gravely wrong. Her worst fear -- the same nagging fear shared by so many Juarez mothers -- would soon be realized. Andrea Puchalsky, Lears director of communications, acknowledged that the company has not made any public statements regarding Gonzalezs murder, nor has it enacted any proactive measures to protect employees from another wave of violence. \Adding security is not a question that relates to Lear,\ she said. \[Gonzalez's murder] did not happen on Lear property.\ When questioned about the murder and Lear policies, Puchalsky mentioned that a company memo was prepared for her with responses to possible questions. As to Lears worker-lockout policy, which apparently put Gonzalez in a precarious situation the day of her abduction, Puchalsky declined to comment on whether Gonzalez was locked out or sent home from Lears plant on her last day. \We have a policy for tardiness and she was tardy many times,\ Puchalsky said. \When she had arrived late to work her shift, she was not there in time to work her shift.\ When asked whether Lears offices in the U.S. have a similar policy in which late employees are barred from working their shifts, Puchalsky reversed her earlier statement, vehemently denying that such a policy existed anywhere within Lears operations. \There is not a policy to send a worker home after X number of tardy arrivals,\ she said. \Typically what we do is if there is someone arriving late on kind of a warning system, there might be a notification that 'the next time you arrive late, you have to take a day off ...' It's not a policy, though. There is no written policy like that throughout Lear Corp.\ The body of 17-year-old Lilia Alejandra Garcia was found mutilated just 300 feet from her maquiladora in February 2001, and since then her case has come to embody the incompetence and corruption of police and prosecutors from Ciudad Juarez to the state capital in Chihuahua City and south all the way to Mexico City. Garcia, the mother of a 5-month-old baby and a 2-year-old child, apparently was kidnapped just after she left work. She was held in captivity for a week, repeatedly beaten and raped, and then strangled. Then-prosecutor Suly Ponce told the Juarez newspaper El Diario that Garcia was the first woman of the year to be murdered and raped in this area of the city - - even though two days before, the body of an unidentified woman was found naked just blocks away. When an FBI leak revealed witness testimony linking Lilia Garcias killers to drug dealers, Suly Ponce dismissed it, calling it erroneous. She instead blamed workers in a circus across the street from the strip mall where Garcia was last seen. When circus managers claimed that Ponce offered them money to blame co-workers, she dropped the investigation. According to a July article in the El Paso Times, former Chihuahua state forensic chief Oscar Maynez Grijalva said Garcia was killed in a similar manner as three of the eight women found in the cotton field with Claudia vette Gonzalez in November 2001. Curiously, local authorities behaved just as evasively in that investigation as in Garcias. When Gonzalez and the seven other womens bodies were found in November 2001, ex-Chihuahua Attorney General Arturo Gonzalez Rascon immediately fingered two local bus drivers as the culprits. Yet doubts about their guilt arose, especially after Grijalva -- who was Rascons evidence expert at the time -- resigned from his post, citing pressure to fabricate evidence against them. And the head of a local prison was forced from office when he documented signs of torture on the accused men after they had returned from Rascons office. Four months later, in February 2002, a search-and-rescue team combing the cotton field found Claudia lvette Gonzalezs overalls in a plastic bag, along with strands of hair and other crucial pieces of evidence that Rascons investigators had failed to discover. In response, Rascon offered his opinion to the El Paso Times: \The state police have done a thoroughly professional job. I have no doubt about that.\ But on Oct. 28, DNA results revealed that Rascons investigators had properly identified only one of the eight dead women -- Gonzalez. Stuck with a far more dubious task than catching one madman or replacing one feeble leader, Juarezs fractured civil society has been paralyzed. A cynical mood is palpable just by speaking to citizens on the street, who unanimously express fear and distrust of law-enforcement and government officials. Some local cops are just as cynical. \We can't just sit around in deserted places waiting for someone to drive up and dump bodies off,\ said one municipal police officer seated in an idling paddy wagon who refused to give his name for security reasons. \There are too few of us and the city's too big ... We don't get much support from the federal government. Judicially, we are not protected like cops in the U.S. Plus, the arms they give us are weak and the bulletproof vests don't really stop bullets. It's not just that, though. I have a young woman in my home so I can put myself in the place of the parents who have lost their daughters. But it's a question of society. We need their support and they need them to be more conscious if it is going to get any better here.\ The scope of the crime is so enormous, and there has been so little success in stopping it, that suspicion breeds on itself. The litany of theories as to who the killers are and what their motive might be suggests that Juarez has become a breeding ground for every imaginable predator. And yet, nobody knows. Nothing is certain. And that feeds the climate of paranoia. Garcia and Gonzalezs murders are rumored to be the work of a serial killer with possible ties to drug dealers. Yet Garcia was found with marks on her wrists that, according to local forensics experts, were identical to those made by police handcuffs. And upon the discovery of her daughters overalls, Josefina Gonzalez told the El Paso Times that someone powerful was undoubtedly responsible for the murder. Many in Mexicos law enforcement community agree that a ring of rich men are behind some of the killings, but they have no evidence to support the theory. Some suggest that some young men from the local aristocracy are responsible, but are being protected by their parents. A persistent theory holds that the murders -- or a significant subset of them -- are linked to powerful narcotraficantes who have co-opted segments of the local ruling class. And the cynicism has been exacerbated by the fact that of the 17 men and one woman accused as serial killer masterminds of the murders, only one has been convicted, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist and resident of Texas at the time of his extradition to Mexico in 1995. Currently, Sharif is awaiting sentencing for allegedly paying a drug trafficker named Victor Manuel Rivera Moreno to carry out about a dozen murders. However, evidence against Sharif is suspect and charges against him have been changed repeatedly. Once he was even charged with killing a woman, Elizabeth Ontiveros, who showed up later at police offices to prove she was alive. In 1996, Sharif was accused of paying the gang Los Rebeldes to kill 17 women. Then, in 1999, he was charged with hiring five bus drivers and an El Paso man from his jail cell to kill seven women. Officials claimed Sharif hired the killers to deflect blame from himself. By 1999, judges had cleared him of all charges, citing an absence of concrete evidence and the possibility of witness intimidation by prosecutors. Suly Ponce, who supervised the case, has yet to make a compelling case against him. In a 1999 radio interview, rather than presenting hard evidence, she claimed Sharif was aggressively hostile toward women because of his Egyptian background. Now she says that the case against Sharif hinges on Morenos declaration that Sharif paid him to carry out the killings with money he earned from 13 patents he developed for Benchmark Research and Technology. But according to an article in the El Paso Times, Benchmark has never paid employees for patent development. In a telephone interview last week with Salon, Ponce said she hadnt known this. Angela Paiaveras, the current special prosecutor, declined to discuss Sharifs case or any aspect of the investigations. Many local residents scoff at the notion that the killers have been caught. \We don't believe that the guys they have arrested are the killers,\ says Miguel Angel Jaramillo, a mid-level manager for the Lear Corp. \It's obvious that they're just scapegoats.\ Yet Ponce remains ardent in her belief that Sharif is at the center of the murders. \Today the killings continue because there are many imitators,\ she told Salon last week. \But after Sharif was caught, there were almost no homicides for a year.\ But according to the Juarez daily El Diario, the year immediately after Sharif was jailed -- a period spanning from October 1995 to October 1996 -- 28 young women were found murdered. Meanwhile, the theories flourish and become more and more paranoid, reflecting a breakdown in public trust. By one popular theory, the women are being murdered at blood rituals for a cabal of wealthy, powerful men. Another theory posits a financial motive for murder. \We're finding a lot of girls that are mutilated in the same way,\ says a young municipal police officer who declined to give his name. \Someone's probably killing them to take their organs to sell them for a lot of money in the U.S.\ When asked if there was any evidence to support the theory, the officer replied that it was only a hunch. Such a climate sends a message to the killers every day: You can get away with anything, even a crime on this scale. But where such a climate breeds cynicism and hopelessness among people who live and work here, it has also provoked an incipient revolt. On her radio show \Grueso Calibre\ (\Large Caliber\), popular host Samira lzaguirre frequently aired the views of guests who were critical of how authorities handled the murders. When Attorney General Rascon accused the two bus drivers of the cotton field murders in November 2001, lzaguirre hosted the drivers wives on her show. After that interview, advertisements began appearing in local newspapers smearing lzaguirre with claims that she frequented strip clubs and was romantically involved with one of the bus drivers. News media on both sides of the border have reported that the receipt for the ad was signed by government officials who paid for it. Then, in February, when lzaguirre started organizing a vigil and announced a hunger strike on her show on Radio Canon, she was fired. Fearing for her safety, she moved across the border to El Paso. Others, too, have discovered that pressing the complaint too forcefully brings reprisal. Marisela Ortiz, co-director of Nuestras Hijas Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home), a legal support group for victims parents, was a frequent guest on \Grueso Calibre.\ Like Izaguirre, Ortiz has focused her resources on drawing attention to government and police incompetence in the slain womens cases. And she says that, like lzaguirre, she has faced ever-increasing danger. In Nuestras Hijas office in central Juarez, located inside a small one-story row house with a \For Rent\ sign out front, Ortiz described the shadow of terror that has stalked her since she began pressuring the authorities. She claims she was threatened by ex-Chihuahua District Attorney Arturo Gonzalez Rascon. \Rascon came all the way to Juarez [from Chihuahua City] to tell me not to involve myself in all the cases,\ she tells Salon. \Then I got a message on my phone saying: 'You have daughters that are alive. Take care of them.\ Rascon, in an earlier story by the Associated Press, denied the allegation. Last May, Ortiz says, she was pursued by men in a black pickup truck who tried to kidnap her. She believes the attempt was orchestrated by Rascons office since it occurred only a day before she had planned to travel to El Paso for a meeting with the FBI and Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, who is calling for a bi-national investigation into the murders. Victims parents who came to Nuestras Hijas for help in finding their missing daughters also say they have been threatened. Mario Lee Lopez and his wife, Soledad Aguilar, lost their daughter, Cecilia Covarrubias. She was kidnapped in 1995 along with their granddaughter, who was two months old. By now their granddaughter would be 7, and Lopez and Aguilars own investigation has led them to believe that she is alive and living in the custody of a well-connected local family. To an outsider it is a desperate story, all but impossible to prove. Lopez accuses Ponce of coordinating the coverup of the kidnappings and murder: again, Ponce denies the charge. And she was adamant that government officials have harassed no one. \I didnt have any knowledge of threats against anybody,\ she said. \On the contrary, we support the families and they are encouraged to be intimately involved in the investigations.\ Lopez recalls an incident in which he had gone to Juarez's judicial building to press his granddaughter's case and did not exactly find the kind of support Ponce mentioned. While leaving the court, Lopez says, he was confronted by a high- ranking minister who warned that if he didn't drop the investigation, he would be tortured with electric shock devices. \But its too late to stop now,\ Lopez adds with a wistful smile. Despite the campaign against lzaguirre, or perhaps because of it, the vigil took place as scheduled in March. It was an unprecedented show of solidarity, with thousands of people gathered in the cotton field where Gonzalez and the seven others were found in an irrigation ditch. There are still tatters of yellow police tape there, and candleholders left from the vigil are strewn over the site. Eight red crosses mark the spot where the bodies were found. However, city officials have no plans to memorialize the site as Juarezs residents have. In fact, according to a Sept. 4 article in El Diario, the site is now being used as a dumping ground for Juarezs Department of Parks and Gardens. Near downtown Juarez there is a monument to Abraham Lincoln, honoring him for \establishing North American industries, today the most important in the world.\ Not far away is a simple gallery where the Collective Antigone [Antigone Collective], a group of local artists, has organized a series of public performances, installations and conferences focused on Juarezs crisis of violence. Each week, the artists gather to collaborate and discuss strategy. At a table with 12 other artists and writers, in an expansive room filled with cubist-inspired paintings, Antonio Munoz Ortega, a 51-year-old writer, describes the Collectives goals and the problems confronting the group. \Our government is authoritarian, and authoritarian governments are principally concerned with the manipulation of life,\ he says. \The victims families feel manipulated by the authorities insensitivity and this has manifested a greater and greater cynicism here thats really dangerous. The struggle, then, is for reparation and simply regaining our daily lives.\ Ortega says he was moved to action by Samira Izaguirre's candlelight vigil in March. He describes the building of an impromptu church in front of the Association of Maquiladoras office as an effort to \communicate through a different language, one thats symbolic.\ This decision, he says, helped lead to the formation of the Collective. The rallying cry for Collectiva Antigona, as evidenced by the name, has been Sophocles Greek tragedy, \Antigone,\ which tells the tale of a girls persecution at the hands of a cruel dictator for burying her brother. The Collectiva has organized readings of the play around the state of Chihuahua and plans a public performance in the future. The Collectiva also has begun to establish a visual presence around central Juarez, most noticeably by painting a wall spanning an entire block with poetry written by participants in a recent writers conference on violence against women. On Nov. 1 and 2, the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertos, the collective filled a room with traditional altars honoring the victims along with a giant cross in the center of the room covered with masks, intended to symbolize the anonymity of the victims. An estimated 1,500 people viewed the exhibit. A week later, working with Nuestras Hijas, the collective placed a coffin and flowers and had a bonfire in the cotton field ditch where Claudia Ivette Gonzalez and seven others were found. \It is absolutely necessary to affect civil society with the intention of shaking the indolence and to provoke some sort of reaction from the people,\ says Mariela Paniagua, a 41-year-old painter. \People are no longer affected by what is happening in this city. They have lost the capacity for outrage in the face of these acts.\ While Collectiva Antigona meets, another group gathers a few miles away to combat Juarezs violence by drastically different means. Past the seemingly endless rows of cardboard hovels in the desperately poor CoIonia Morelos, beyond the municipal dump, on a rocky desert mesa in the shadow of Mount Indio, members of a search-and-rescue group called Banda Civil spread out through the hills to search for more murder victims. Luz Elena Guerrero Guerra, a strong-looking woman in her late 50s with an intense gaze, serves as president of one of Banda Civils six divisions. Guerra tells of how it began as a search-and-rescue group in 1985 to assist during a massive earthquake in Mexico City and evolved to respond to Juarezs crisis. She herself found the first slain womens bodies in 1989, before investigators had even identified the deadly trend. Today, Banda Civils members still lend their help during natural disasters but the bulk of their work comes in the search for bodies, monitoring of schools and a citywide crime- awareness campaign. Ever-present terror, coupled with the impotence of Juarezs authorities, forced Banda Civils transformation, Guerra says. \I've narrowly escaped violence many times,\ she explains. \Sometimes it is just pure luck that a bus or a taxi happens to come by in time when someone is chasing me ... All of us, we're uncertain of what the authorities are telling us. That's our indignation. If they [the authorities] aren't interested in helping, we'll pressure them.\ Because the group is required by law to cooperate with police, some view it with suspicion. Yet they have had success where most other activist groups have failed. It was Banda Civil members who made the crucial discovery of Claudia lvette Gonzalezs overalls in February, humiliating Attorney General Rascon and breathing new life into the investigation. And Banda Civil has continued to find more evidence during their weekly searches of Juarezs human dumping grounds. Besides its role as a search-and-rescue/quasi-vigilante group, Banda Civil has the feel of a support group, providing members with an outlet from the daily fear that comes with life in Juarez. According to Guerra, over 300 people have accompanied the group on searches and many of them are family members of missing women. And indeed, the searches are a family activity. On one recent Saturday, the search was joined by about 60 participants of all ages and from all sectors of Juarez society, including a middle manager from the Lear Corp. There were no terrible discoveries that day, and yet afterward, as people stood around talked and listened to norteno music blaring from a car stereo, it was evident just how deeply the murders are ingrained into life here -- and how some people are fighting back with whatever tools they have at hand. Perhaps the quiet optimism is derived from the age-old Mexican axiom that death brings about rebirth. \Instead of spending our time criticizing the authorities, we're trying to find some solutions,\ says Santos. \We all have sisters and daughters here and we all feel the same. My daughter is in danger. I can't let her live like this.\ -- By Max Blumenthal [3( Copyright © 2010 Salon Media Group, Inc.

C05766224	sbwhoeop Wednesday, December 16, 2009 5:48 PM H: In case you havent seen, but dont give yourself a grade if asked. Sid Poll: Clinton approval soars By: Eamon „lavers December 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST A new poll of avid news watchers shows that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a much higher approval rating than the man she once campaigned against and now works for, President Barack Obama. In the poll of 800 registered voters who are self-identified \news watchers,\ Clinton had a 75 percent approval rating and a 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent approval and a 45 percent disapproval rating. The Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has not been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administrations agenda, including the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not been subjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama, meanwhile, has been on national television on a _ daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues. The poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12th, and it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding on Obama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls — in October, for example, a Gallup poll found that Clinton had become more popular than the president. Clarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clintons high poll numbers is her high approval among Republicans — numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future, if she chooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats, a healthy 57 percent approval among Republicans, and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular among Democrats — 93 percent — but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell off dramatically, at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively. Clintons Republican numbers are striking, given how intensely disliked she has been in the past among GOP voters. In fact, part of Obamas appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that he was more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton, who was by then a well-known figure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s. \Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues,\ said Faucheux. \It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration.\ Asked about any future Clinton presidential bid, he said, \She's in good shape now.\ The next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who notched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63 percent among both Republicans and independents. \Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board,\ said Faucheux. \Everybody else did well among Democrats but fell off among Republicans.\ Another trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in the rest of the country. \These results show that the 'Beltway echo chamber' does not reflect the rest of the country, even among news watchers,\ said Faucheux. Among White House staffers and advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — who is often seen on television — had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had the lowest approval, at 25 percent. Summers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — who are both closely associated with the economy — both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers disapproval rating was 41 percent. Geithners disapproval rating was 45 percent, one point higher than his approval rating. The poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is often viewed as having sharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, at 72 percent, than Republicans, at 13 percent. Among other major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and 41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius both posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod scored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Jones had a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.

A majority or plurality disapproves of Obamas management of the economy, health care, the budget deficit, the overhaul of financial market regulations and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a Bloomberg National Poll conducted July 9- 12. In addition, almost 6 in 10 respondents say the war in Afghanistan is a lost cause. Almost two-thirds say they feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction, an even more sour assessment than in March when 58 percent felt that way. Two-thirds of independent voters are pessimistic, while just 56 percent of Democrats offer a vote of confidence. \They dont see any solutions in sight,\ said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa- based firm that conducted the nationwide survey. \They have been hammered by the economy and there is a disconnect between the lives Americans are living and Washington. They seem to have lost hope.\ Poll respondents are divided on their congressional preference between Democrats and Republicans, with both sides getting 43 percent support. Among those who say they are most likely to vote, Republicans are favored, 48 percent to 40 percent. The Republican advantage is even greater among likely voters who view the election as exceptionally important, with Republicans beating Democrats 56 percent to 34 percent. Control of Congress For the Democrats, whd control Congress and the White House, the survey shows the potential 'for losses in November, when voters will fill all 435 House seats, 36 Senate seats and 37 governorships. The outcome could affect °Pam's ability to move his agenda through Congress for the two years leading up to his own 2012 re-election bid. The fate of incumbents will depend to some extent on what happens to the economy in the next four months and whether unemployment drops much from its current 9.5 percent. A rising stock market could help as well. So far this year, the S&P 500 stock index has declined 1.8 percent. The public's disenchantment with the president's Policies doesn't extend to voter feelings about Obama himself, as he gets a job approval rating of 52 percent and personally is viewed favorably by 55 percent. Obama, 48, remains more popular than any of the Republican figures tested in the poll and is topped only by Secretary of State :-- ;:!aity ant.cn and General Da,,,td Petraeos, the new commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, among a list of 15 people and political parties reviewed. Republican Leaders The only bright spot for Republican candidates is for Louisiana Governor Eiob%) 1i:tele!, who gets a 32 percent favorable rating and an 18 percent unfavorable grade. Better-known party leaders such as former vice presidential candidate :a-et..n and former House Speaker Netf,ri: CirigPait both have negative ratings that outweigh the positive views. Although turnout in midterm elections is historically lower than in presidential races, the electorate is interested. Four- fifths of Americans who plan to vote say November's election is very or exceptionally important. The likelihood to vote is strongest among older voters, Republicans and those with the highest incomes. Among those 55 and older. three-quarters say they will definitely vote, compared with 48 percent of those younger than 35. Four-fifths of Republicans say they will definitely vote, compared with 65 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of independents. Referendum on °barna Seeking to capitalize on the intensity expressed by voters, Republicans want to make the election a national referendum on Obama and the party in power, while the White House and Democrats argue it is about going forward, rather than backward to failed policies. The challenge for Democrats will be to translate their vision of a better future into more positive feelings about the economy among voters. In the poll, Republicans have the advantage among the independents often critical to winning elections. Among independents likely to vote, Republican congressional candidates are preferred to Democrats, 50 percent to 29 percent. \Anything that has been tried hasnt resulted in making anything better in the world where ordinary people live,\ Selzer said. \Thats a bad scenario for incumbents of the majority party.\ Incumbent Disadvantage A third of poll participants say they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who has served in Congress for many years. About one-fifth of likely voters say the election is more about sending a message, while three-quarters say it is about picking the party that has the best ideas. \I dont know what these people are thinking in Washington,\ says poll respondent Jeff Lockman, 41, a professional golfer and Republican from Malvern, Pennsylvania. \They are going in 10 different directions and they really dont know what to focus on.\ The proportion who feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction is about the same as at this poin't in 1994, when Republicans took control of Congress, and 2006, when Democrats took over. The public also has soured on Obama's foreign-policy priority, the war in Afghanistan. While the president has ordered an expansion of forces to turn the tide in a conflict where he says the U.S. has a critical stake, 58 percent say it is a lost cause, compared with 36 percent who say it can still be won. A slim majority of Republicans -- 52 percent -- say the U.S. can still win in Afghanistan, while 71 percent of Democrats say the conflict is lost. Afghanistan Withdrawal Six in 10 Americans say it would be best to stick with Obarna's plan to start withdrawing forces in July 2011, while one-third say they remain open to keeping the same number of troops there, or even adding additional forces. Reflecting the belief among many that the war cannot be won, a third of Americans say they have become less supportive of the effort there in recent months. The Bloomberg National Poll is based on interviews with 1,004 U.S. adults ages 18 or older. Percentages based on the full sample may have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. :4:?,r;yr• '. 3cwrra:1, who studies public opinion at the ,A;-necicar Entarpr:F.:e institute, a public-policy research group in Washington, cails the poll \very, very grim news for the Democrats.\ At the same time, she says, one silver lining for Democrats is that Republicans have yet to convince voters that they have a plan. Obarna Visit One signpost for Democrats in the poll is the finding that just 26 percent of Americans say it would help a Democratic candidate in their area to get a visit from Obama, while 20 percent say it would hurt the candidate and 54 percent say it wouldn't matter or they don't know. Obama's worst ratings are for his handling of the budget deficit, where 59 percent disapprove and 37 percent approve. It's his worst grade for that subject in any of four Bloomberg polls taken since September 2009. The Obama administration expects a record budget deficit this year of more than $1.5 trillion, or 10.6 percent of GDP, according to projections the White House released in February. It was $1.4 trillion for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, which covers the end ofGecrge W. Bush's presidency, and Obama has said that the current fiscal shortfall as well as theunemployment rate are inheritances from his Republican predecessor's administration. \My biggest fear is we have people in government who dont have a clue about what is going on in the economy,\ says poll respondent Jim Heeter, 66, from Glendale, Arizona. \They have never run a business or had to make a payroll.\ Economy, Health Care Slim majorities disapprove of Obamas handling of the economy and health care. When it comes to creating jobs, he gets 46 percent approval, addressing problems on Wall Street, 42 percent support, running the war in Afghanistan, 46 percent approve, and managing the BP Plc oil spill, 46 percent support. Forty-five percent say they have become more supportive in recent months of tougher regulations for Wall Street. The momentum is heading in the opposite direction from the White House and Democrats on most other issues. Almost half say they have become less supportive in recent months of federal money being loaned to automotive companies to help them stay in business, while 37 percent have become less supportive of the health-care overhaul passed by Congress earlier this year. A majority, 61 percent, say the nation should wait and see how the health-care legislation works or leave it alone, while 37 percent want to see it repealed. Arizona Immigration Law Almost half of Americans say they have also grown more supportive of allowing local law enforcement to detain anyone who cant produce proof of citizenship when stopped for an offense, as is contemplated in an Arizona law. Cbama has criticized the measure and the Justice Department has announced it plans to sue Arizona. At least half of respondents also say they would be less likely to support candidates who voted to give financial assistance to the banking or automobile industries. Americans are roughly divided on whether they would be more or less likely to support a candidate who voted against extending unemployment benefits because of concern over the cost. A measure providing such support worth $34 billion is stalled in Congress. Clinton Popularity The disaffection with Obarna and Democrats doesnt carry over to all Democrats. Hillary Clinton, 62, is viewed favorably by 61 percent of respondents and a quarter of Americans, including 30 percent of Republicans and 21 percent of Democrats, say the nation would be in a better place if she had been elected president. The Tea Party movement, which has been mainly associated with Republicans, has lukewarm support in the poll. A majority of 58 percent of all respondents says it would make no difference to them if a candidate was backed by Tea Party activists, while a third of Republicans say that kind of backing would make a candidate more appealing to them. Those who are more likely to think the Tea Party is a simplistic and misguided movement -- 44 percent of all respondents -- include Democrats, 65 percent, and those with the highest incomes, 52 percent. Independent voters are divided on whether it is misguided or has rightly identified that the nation would be better served by reduced federal government, compared with 39 percent overall.

Sid B6 A must read piece that looks at the Koch brothers control and funding of the tea party and right wing. http://www.nowyorkenconlirep2rtin08130/100830fa fpct maysl2pitatIbie=true#IxzzoxQ uvTcbT A REPORTER AT 1.ARGE COVERT OPERATIONS The billionaire brothers who are waging a war against Obama. by Jane Mayetmo, (.s.. David H. Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred million dollars to right-wing causes. On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire tOok the stage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for his generosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the companys upcoming season, and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the galas co-chairs, Blaine Trump, in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedys mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch had bought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small. The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the citys most prominent philanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize. Lincoln Centers New York State Theatre building, which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing is named for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Koch pledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize in the city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty million dollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him. One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the events third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her office said that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it might have created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealth attacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular. With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate, headquartered in Wichita. Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company has grown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries in Alaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels, Dixie. cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Staimnaster carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largest private company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Koch—who, years ago, bought out two other brothers—among the richest Men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars is exceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social services for the needy, and much less oversight of industry—especially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with the brothers corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amhersts Political Economy Research Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States.- And Greenpeace issued a report identifying the company as a \kingpin of climate science denial.\ The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastly outdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, unclerwritinga huge network of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns against so many Obama Administration policies—from health-care reform to the economic-stimulus program----that, in political circles, their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus. In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report \distorts the environmental record of our companies.\ And. . David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the \radical press\ had turned his family into \whipping boys,\ and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, \The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times.\ few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation—an organization that David Koch started, in 2004—held a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defending the American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures, lie did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a,dance performance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit, warned that Administration officials \have a socialist visiOn for this country.\ Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. An advertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. \Today, the voices of average Americans are being drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,\ it said. \But you can do something about it.\ The pitch made no mention of its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. David . Axelrod, Obamas senior adviser, said, \What they dont say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens movement brought to you by a bunch of oil billionaires.\ In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson; denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, saying that Americans for Prosperity is \an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.\ .Later, she issued a statement: \No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch or David Koch specifically to support the tea parties.\ David Koch told New York, \Ive never been to a tea-party event. No one representing the tea party has ever even approached me.\ At the lectern in Austin, however, Venable—a longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans for Prosperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994—spoke less warily: \We love what the Tea Parties are doing, because thats how were going to take back America!\ she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequent interview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, \I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!\ She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help \educate\ Tea Party activists on policy details, and to give them \next-step training\ after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled \more effectively.\ And she noted that Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs. \Theyre certainly our people. Davids the chairman of our board. Ive certainly met with them, and Im very appreciative Of what they do.\ Venable honored several Tea Party \citizen leaders\ at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave its Blogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama as the \cokehead in chief.\ In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of \demonic possession (aka schizophrenia, etc.).\ The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress best known for her role on the television series \Northern Exposure.\ She declared, \They dont want our children to know about their rights. They dont want our children to know about a God!\ During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obama was \the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,\ and had hidden from voters a secret agenda—\the government taking over our economy and our lives.\ Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was the epic fight of our generation!\ As the crowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: \Victory, or death!\ Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movements inception. In the weeks before the first Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters \Tea Party Talking Points.\ The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for \Taxpayer Tea Party Registration\ and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. The North Carolina branch recently launched a \Tea Party Finder\ Web site, advertised as \a hub for all the Tea Parties in North Carolina.\ The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to \educate,\ fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-based think tank that the Kochs fund, said, \The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that its been all chiefs and no Indians. There havent been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has been trying to create a movement.\ With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, \everyone suddenly sees that for the first time there are Indians out there—people who can provide real ideological power.\ The Kochs, he said, are \trying to shape and control and channel the populist uprising into their own policies.\- A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, \The Koch brothers gave the money that founded it. Its like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and the frogs come out of the mud—and theyre our candidates!\ The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relations executive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and Mortimer Zuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch, called him \a patriot who cares deeply about his country.\ Zuckerman praised Davids \gentle decency\ and the \range of his public interests.\ The Republican campaign consultant said of the familys political activities, \To call them under the radar is an understatement. They are underground!\ Another former Koch adviser said, \Theyre smart. This right-wing, redneck stuff works for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves.\ Rob Stein, a Democratic political strategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are \at the epicenter of the anti-Obama movement. But its not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with Bill • Clinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.\ ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutch printer who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemical engineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline; but, according to family lore, Americas major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Koch found work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalins regime set up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Kochs Soviet colleagues. Koch was deeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company, Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had been destroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, \As the Soviets became a stronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.\ In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the john Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, in part, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that the Communists have infiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties.\ He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Communists in Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. \The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to take over America,\ he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment \a vicious race war.\ In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret 'socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would \infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.\ Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins, David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. He recalled that Fred Koch was \a real John Wayne type.\ Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting in Africa, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound across from Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowed to join them. \By instilling a work ethie in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didnt seem like a favor back then,\ Charles has written. \By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time.\ David Koch recalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. \He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrong with government,\ he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of \Radicals for Capitalism,\ a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. \Its something I grew up with—a fundamental point of view that big government was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.\ David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and William all earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventually assumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard and studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially. (Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this:) In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. Fred Koch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni at Deerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole \lifetime trustee.\ He said, \You might ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started when I was alittle boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them for ten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!\ David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according to diZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore in Wichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. \It was pretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,\ diZerega recalled. DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandOned right-wing views, and became a political-science professor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles is one of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZerega believes that the Koch brothers have followed a wayward intellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, and seeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZerega writes, \As state socialism failed ... the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all. Socialism kept. being defined downwards.\ Members of the. John Birch Society developed.an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-market ideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of \The Road to Serfdom\ (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek'S belief in unfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supporters have championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted \The Road to Serfdom\ on his show; the paperback soon became a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of the Kochs; in the midst of arecent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, \I want to thank Charles Koch for this information.\ Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.) Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the state but didn't like the label \anarchist\; he called himself an \autarchist.\ LeFevre liked to say that \government is a disease masquerading as its own cure.\ In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. Brian Doherty, of Reason, told me that \LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charless heart,\ and that the school was \a tiny world of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake.\ According to diZerega, Charles supported the school financially, and even gave him money to take classes there. Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance from Freddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, the companys board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (\Charles runs it all with an iron hand,\ Bruce Bartlett, the economist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983, Charles and David bought out their brothers share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained, and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked past one another with stony expressions at their mothers funeral. Eventually. Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax. He bought historic, estates in France. Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literary manuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-five million dollars to win the Americas Cup, in 1992. With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads the investment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the companys performance has been \beyond phenomenal.\ Charles remained in Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to New York City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. A financial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me, \Charles is the company. Charles runs it.\ David, described by associates as \affable\ and \a bit of a lunk,\ enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South of France and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likened to an \East Coast version of Hugh Hefher's soirees.\ In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine- thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though Davids manner is more cosmopolitan, and more genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldnt think of a single issue on which the brothers disagreed. As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics in America. Charless goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government \out at the root.\ The brothers first major public step came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of the Libertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from the right. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidential slot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The tickets slogan was \The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You.\ In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch, who spent more than two million dollars on the effort. Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation that libertarians were getting ready to stage \a very big tea party,\ because people were \sick to death\ of taxes. The Libertarian Party platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wage laws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs, and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., a more traditional conservative, called the movement \Anarcho-Totalitarianism.\ That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand of politics didnt sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. \It tends to be a nasty, corrupting business,\ he told a reporter at the time. \I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas.\ According to Dohertys book, the .Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely \actors playing out a script.\ A longtime confidant of the Kochs told Doherty that the brothers wanted to \supply the themes and words for the scripts.\ In order to alter the direction of America, they had to \influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia. and think tanks.\ fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred million . dollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch family foundations gave money.to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of which they direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, and lobbyists. The familys subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress, has called the Kochs the billionaires behind the hate.\ Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008 the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spent more than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million. Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company's political-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eighty per cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in political contributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family members have personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, David Koch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation. Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politically active nonprofit groups. In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. In the nineteen-eighties, the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for funding right-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant of Andrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. An Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at the Democratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is Unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personal funds: \Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.\ Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, the Open Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generous private contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued that Soros's giving is transparent, and that \none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests.\ The Kochs have given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry. Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into a rationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, \Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.\ Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitable foundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving, concluding, \These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact the profit margin of Koch Industries.\ The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push the country in a libertarian. direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which files. lawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; and the Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by the Kochs employ specialists who write position Papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch has acknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. \If were going to give a lot of money, well make darn sure they • spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,\ he told Doherty. \And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we dont agree with, we withdraw funding.\ he Kochs subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo that Lewis Powell. then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwar movement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interest crusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fight back. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, \respectable elements of society\—intellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term, • unified campaign to change public opinion. Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. \To bring about social change,\ he told Doherty, requires \a strategy\ that is \vertically and horizontally integrated,\ spanning \from idea creation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to litigation to political action.\ The project, he admitted, was extremely ambitious. \We have a radical philosophy,\ he said. In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nations first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to the Center for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today Cato has more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by the mainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it has consistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies. When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as \beyond dispute,\ the Cato Institute took out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Catos resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts to stop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institutes founder and president, told me that \global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.\ Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climate scientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails went public, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquiries have since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus on global warming. • Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, more Americans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. The Kochs promote this statistic on their companys Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fostering such doubt. In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as \voters believe there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmental reform, he said, was to question the science—a public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years to forestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, which has argued that \scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.\ The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Womens Forum, which opposes the presentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by Nancy Pfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the groups board. Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of \Merchants of Doubt,\ a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion on science. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of \a company with refineries and pipelines,\ have \a lot at stake.\ She added, \If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't be surprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.\ David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it has been, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. \The Earth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,\ he said. n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up another think tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as \the world's premier university source for market-oriented ideas—bridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems.\ Financial records show that the Koch family foundations have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which has gone to the Mercatus Center, a nonprofit organization. \Its ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,\ Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist, said. It is an unusual arrangement. \George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,\ Stein noted. \Virginia is hosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.\ The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbying operation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of the Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co- founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation. Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted Ed Crane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato, Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles's management philosophy, which he distilled into a book called \The Science of Success,\ and trademarked under the name Market-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book. Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with the competitiveness of the marketplace.. Koch describes M.B.M. as a \holistic system\ containing \five dimensions: vision, virtue and talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives.\ A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles \thinks hes a genius. Hes the emperor, and hes convinced hes wearing clothes.\ Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing of Charles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to. be interviewed.) At a 1995 conference for philanthropfsts, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the Mercatus Center's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual raw materials into policy \products.\ The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center \the most important think tank youve never heard of,\ and noted that fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a \hit list\ had been suggested first by Mercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have \other means of fighting [their] battles,\ and that the Mercatus Center does riot actively promote the companys private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University of Texas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that \Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., and Mercatus has constantly hammered on the agency.\ An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center called it \a means of laundering economic aims.\ The lawyer explained the strategy: \You take corporate money and give it to a neutral-sounding think tank,\ which \hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.\ In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oil refineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. The E.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected that if pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year. In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudleys smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the court found that the E.P.A. had \explicitly disregarded\ the \possible health benefits of ozone.\ In another part of the opinion, the court ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the Constitutional Accountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montana ranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment—a group funded by Koch family foundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance. deas dont happen on their own,\ Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me. \Throughout history, ideas need patrons.\ The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that think tanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract the public's support. in 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it was sponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 19.93. Its mission, Kibbe said, \was to take these heavy ideas and translate them for mass America.... We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolent revolutions--Saul _Minsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example of nonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates.\ Within a few years, the group had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles, according to one participant, were \very controlling, very top down. You cant build an organization with them. They run it.\ Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigated their business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of \a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oil from Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring.\ The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-one million dollars worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oil measurement is \a very uncertain art.\ To defend its reputation, Koch IndustrieS hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soon opened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, without issuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personal lives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs tactics. Kenneth Batten, the counsel to the Senate committee, said, \These people have amassed such unaccountable power! . By •1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind of corporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault on Clintons proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging media events, and targeting opponents. And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitol—rallies that NPR described as \designed to strike fear into the hearts of wavering Democrats.\ Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.I.U. tax, recalled, \I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot of 'resources and effort—their employees, too.\ Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. \I can't prove it, but I think I was probably their victim,\ he said. The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this made it difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoff group, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems \myths.\ When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had \no citizen membership of its own.\ In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called \an audacious plan to pour millions of dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,\ in order to evade campaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads in twenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group, the Economic Education Trust. The Senate committees minority report suggested that \the trust was financed in whole or in part by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas.\ The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads, most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active, the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given the money, refused to comment. In i998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs payroll had been involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as \historic. Triad was the first time a major corporation used a cutout\—a front operation—\in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child of a company run amok.\ uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the Justice Department filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills, which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as two hundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed to spend five million dollars on environmental projects. In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosion that resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the final months of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, for covering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company was liable •for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison. The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, including the falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David Uhlmann, a career prosecutor who, at the time, headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as \one of the most significant cases ever brought under the Clean Air Act.\ He added, \Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance, and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.\ During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidacies of George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyed remarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offered enormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to a study by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since 2000. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bushs reelection. The groups Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support for John Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal, for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan political purposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.) That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Fink started a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who had worked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign- consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillipss online biography describes him as an expert in \grasstops\ and \grassroots\ political organizing. The Kochs choice of Phillips signalled an even greater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising \throat slitters\ in politics, called Phillips \a grownup who can make things happen.\ Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members. Currently, its Web site claims that the group has \1.2 million activists.\ Whatever its size, the Kochs political involvement has been intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity \was micromanaged by the Kochs.\ And the brothers investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the familys other organizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency. In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of \the greatest loss of liberty and prosperity since the 1930s.\ That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives at a Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern, thanked David Koch, and vowed to \unite and fiaht ... the armies of the left!\ Sodn after Obama assumed office, Americans for Prosperity launched \Porkulus\ rallies against Obamas stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released a report claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author was forced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing.the paper, had labelled Obamas program \a slush fund,\ and Fox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans for Prosperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, often guest-hosts for Limbaugh.) Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to be more than three hundred rallies against health-care reform. Atone rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; at another, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses from Dachau. The group also helped organize the \Kill the Bill\ protests outside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at. Phillips was a featured speaker. Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at making industries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yard barbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obamas \green jobs\ czar, Van Jones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting, his group as a champion of ordinary workers who would be hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conference on climate change, declaring, \We're a grassroots organization.... 1 think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthy families . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.\ Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives from Americans for Prosperity, told me that last summers raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obamas agenda. The Republican leadership in Congress, he said, \couldn't have clone it without August, when people went out on the streets. It discouraged deal-makers\—Republicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, the appearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. \K Street is a three-billion-dollar weathervane,\ Norquist said. \When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the Obama Administration.' But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressmen. August is what changed it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.\ As the first anniversary of Obamas election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triumphant Americans for Prosperity gathering. Obamas poll numbers were falling fast. Not .a single Republican senator was working with the Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obamas political ineptitude, and Tea Party groups were accusing the President of initiating \a government takeover.\ In a speech, Koch said, \Days like today bring to reality the vision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago.\ He went on, \We envisioned a mass movement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life standing up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history.... Thankfully, the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens are beginning to see the same truths as we do.\ . While Koch didnt explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has come close to doing so, praising it for demonstrating the \powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in government power, the massive efforts to socialize this country.\ Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees, compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. The Kochs sense of imperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, and since the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers message has evidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist. Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before the midterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonetheless plans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, and running ads aimed at \educating voters about where candidates stand.\ Though the Kochs have slowed Obamas momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewed by FrumForum.com this spring, said, \If you look at where weve gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion of government spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesnt look very good at all.\ He went on, \It looks like the infrastructure that was built and ruirtitred has not carried the day.\ He suggested that the Kochs needed \to get more into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.\ n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash.in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As he was recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started a family, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, \When youre the only one who survived in the front of the plane and everyone.else died—yeah, you think, My God, the good Lord spared me for some greater purpose. My joke is that Ive been busy ever since, doing all the good work 1 can think of, so He can have confidence in me.\ Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research, focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York- Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns Hopkins University, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan- Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National Cancer Advisory Board, which guides the National.Cancer Institute. Kochs corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that David Koch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent the E.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a \known carcinogen\ in humans. Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concluded that formaldehyde causes cancer in human beings—including one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, on •whose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposed to higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel within the National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictly controlled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and Koch Industries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulations until more studies are completed. Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood- products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and uses it to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2 billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacifics vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formal letter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company \strongly disagrees\ with the N.I.H. panels conclusion that formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the National Cancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keep formaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.) James Fluff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., told me that it was \disgusting\ for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: \It's just not good for public health. Vested interests should not be on the board.\ He went on, \Those boards are very important. Theyre very influential as to whether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.\ Harold Vannus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which he used to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, \a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing we wouldnt tolerate in our board members is tobacco.\ When told of Koch Industries stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said that he was \surprised.\ he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, is a multimedia exploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confronted with a giant graph charting the Earths temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than it was ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, \HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD.\ The message, as amplified by the exhibits Web site, is that \key human adaptations evolved in response to environmental instability.\ Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline \OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,\ is it noted that levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increase dramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible role played by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, \During the period in which humans evolved, Earths temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere fluctuated together.\ An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climate change in the future. People may build \underground cities;\ developing \short, compact bodies\ or \curved spines,\ so that \moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.\ Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argueS that \fluctuations in the earths climate predate humanity,\ and concludes, \Since we cant control Mother Nature, lets figure out how to get along with her changes.\ Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by the Smithsonians presentation. \The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,\ he said. \I think the Kochs wanted to be seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country. But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground .funders of action to stop efforts to deal with this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.\ Cristian Samper, the museums director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as \one of the best donors weve had, in my tenure here, because hes very interested in the content, but completely hands off.\ He noted, \1. dont know all the details.of his involvement in other issues.\ The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate what David Koch has called \the largest company that youve never heard of.\ But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party, and with increased awareness of the Kochs ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently, President °barna took aim at the Kochs political network. Speaking at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser, in Austin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Courts recent ruling in the Citizens United case—which struck down laws prohibiting direct Corporate spending on campaigns—had made it even easier for big companies to hide behind \groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity.\ Obama said, \They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans for Prosperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation\—or even, he added, \a big oil company.\

Gene is closer to the action and I defer to him on the latest Jail-ian thinking and machinations vis-a-vis the cabinet and INC. I hadnt heard about ENI-related corruption but wouldnt be surprised. On the federalism issue,. Jail is right to be concerned about eastern agitation for autonomy. A cabinet chance wont solve that problem, though. Nor will recruiting Belhaj and Islamist fighters to take on the Bardans. To the contrary, it would only lead to unwanted bloodshed - the large Obeid tribe still nurses a serious grudge against Belhaj and his ilk for the Islamists presumed role in killing their beloved Gen. Yunis last July and would probably put up a fierce fight. The cabinet and INC need to have a serious discussion with the Bargans - if they arent already doing so - about how power and resources are to be distributed in the new Libya. The Libyans held similarly heated debates on this very topic in the early1950s as they held their first parliamentary elections and drafted their constitution (there were actually violent skirmishes in connection with those elections, and Washington delayed the arrival of the first US ambassador until after things had calmed down). Hopefully the current leadership can negotiate these issues peaceably in the corning months.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. Let me know your thoughts: SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services. 1.On April 17, 2012 Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil stated to a close advisor that he is considering when, or even if, to hold a vote of no confidence in the NTC regarding support for the government of Prime Minister Abdel Rahman al-Keib. According to a source with access to the NTC leadership, Jalil realizes that a majority of the Council members no longer support el-Keib and his cabinet of Western educated technical experts. Jaili continues to believe that, for the moment, the most important issue facing the NTC is the federalist movement toward a semi-autonomous state in the Eastern region of Cyrenaica (Barge in Arabic). This situation continues to complicate the NTC efforts to stabilize the country. With this in mind, Jalil expressed concern that a dramatic vote of no confidence for el-Keib will weaken the entire NTC by association. Instead, according to this source, Jalil is considering delaying a CiOCISI011, possibly putting it off until an elected legislature is in place in the late summer or early fall of 2012. 2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the NTC has been able to reach a temporary understanding with the eastern federalists, allowing the separatists to administer their local regions, while deferring to the NTC for national and international issues. The complicating factor at this point lies in reaching a determination regarding who has authority over new contracts with oil companies and other international firms. As of the week of April 16, 2012, no decision has been reached on this point. The bulk of the NTC leadership is drawn from Barge, and Jalil now believes they can control the situation if they can establish an organized central government. In particular, Jalil, according to a sensitive source, is increasingly confident that the eastern roots of the NTC will allow him to balance the federalist movement against the need for a sense of national unity. In the opinion of this source, el-Keibs future depends on Jalils opinion of his capacity to deal with this complex situation.) 3. Minister of Defense Ousama al Juwali is viewed by Jalil as the most important western Libyan in el-Keibs cabinet, and the President and the leaders of the NTC had hoped that he would be able to deal with the confused security situation in Tripoli. However, while he did receive assurances from General Abdel Hakim Alamin Belhaj regarding possible assistance from his Islamist troops if fighting broke out between the National Army and the militias loyal to the eastern federalists. Unfortunately, from Jalils point of view, this effort seems to have emboldened Belhaj and heightened tension between the eastern and western portions of the country. According to this source, after reviewing the federalist problem, Dr Abd al-Nasser Shamata, the head of the Crisis Management for the NTC, believes that el-Keib, al Juwali, Oil Minister Abdulrahman Ben Yezza, and the bulk of the cabinet should be replaced by people drawn from within the NTC, individuals who are in touch with the concerns of the Libyan people of all tribes and political groups. In the opinion of this source Jalil is factoring this position into his decision on el-Keib. 4. Regarding the existing relationships with international oil firms, Shamata told Jalil that for the most part the existing fields are continuing to produce and the owners have worked out security arrangements with local political and tribal leaders. However, since el-Keib and Ben Yezza have been unable to bring order to the national administration, it is difficult for firms to initiate new projects, since it is not clear who has the authority or the desire to sign such agreements. Shamata stated forcefully that the Prime Minister, whoever he is, must establish an orderly administration before full advantage can be gained from the oil fields. In the meantime, Shamata warns that his office has found evidence of corruption between local officials and international firms. In this regard, he stated that local representatives of the Italian national oil firm (ENI) have made problematic arrangements with local officials in the western part of the country, where their oil fields are located. He added that most of these ENI employees are Libyans, but he believes ENI management in Italy is aware of this situation. Shamata pointed out, without additional comment, that Ben Yezza is a long time senior official of ENI. 5. In the opinion this source, Shamata and Jalil are not planning to publicize these charges regarding ENI, at least until they decide how best to move forward on el-Keib, whether to allow the Prime Minister more time to address his problems, proceed with the vote of no confidence or quietly ask him to step down on his own. 6. (Source Comment: According to this source, el-Keib is under fire primarily as a result of his failure to bring order to the National Army, disarm independent militias, and establish security throughout the country. The leading opposition to el-Keib is based in the Political Issues committee of the NTC, and as many as 42 of the 73 active NTC members will vote against el-Keib if Jalil brings this matter to a vote. The source warns that these numbers are provided by members of this Political committee, who may have their own agenda. A two thirds majority is required for the no confidence vote, however; several senior members of the NTC are reluctant to take such a step until a constituent assembly has been elected. They do not want this to look like the decision of a small group of people.)

Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by \Tokyo Rose\ during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders. More pertinently, it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans: To do otherwise, after all, could \ enhance the relative voice \of some ( i.e. , humans) over others ( i.e. , nonhurnans).

There are several others in play (Corker, Chamblis, Cochran, McCain and Murkowski). Moreover, there are bound to be some \sleepers\ as the vp called them. This could be Roberts, Crapo, Kirk or others. We have a meeting in the morning with Kerry, Lugar and Kyl to discuss the remaining amendments.

C05774167	Ed Miliband's victory was carried by an anti-Blair undercurrent. In the first round voting, David was ahead. But when the votes of Ed Balls was distributed to the second choice of voters, they put Ed over. Balls represents Gordon, but even more a distancing from New Labour. Ed's use of Iraq as an issue is symbolic of the repudiation of New Labour. Ed had more labor union votes for leader, which accounted for one-third of total. Ed's \new generation\ rhetoric covers that regression and continuing reactive impulse. Now the shadow cabinet, due to a new decision, will be elected by the party. Ed is the former environment minister and good on green issues, of course, but has no foreign policy perspective yet instinctively to the left, which means anti-Afghanistan mission as currently conceived, it should go without saying. David lost precisely because he held responsible positions. Sid

Nelson to back 'Don't ask' repeal By: Jen DiMascio May 26, 2010 12:08 PM EDT Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson (D) will back repeal of don't ask don't tell, likely putting repeal proponents over the top in their quest to end the ban on gays serving openly in the military. \I dont believe that most Nebraskans want to continue a policy that not only encourages but requires people to be deceptive and to lie. The Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy does just that,\ Nelson said. \It also encourages suspicion and senior officers to look the other way. In a military which values honesty and integrity, this policy encourages deceit.\ \I will support the Lieberman compromise because it removes politics from the process. It bases implementation of the repeal on the Pentagons review and a determination by our military leaders that repeal is consistent with military readiness and effectiveness, and that the Pentagon has prepared the necessary regulations to make the changes,\ he said, adding that he spoke with Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the issue. \He advised that while he preferred waiting until the study is completed, he can live with this compromise,\ Nelson said. Given statements made by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) that they, too, will vote for repeal, Nebraska's Nelson would be the critical 15th vote required for repeal to be included in the defense authorization bill. Their decisions were also made after earlier news this week that both the White House and Gates could live with a compromise amendment sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D- Pa.). \We thank Senator Nelson for his support and are extremely grateful. He and other senators supporting repeal will be on the right side of history,\ said Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. \While Senator Nelsons vote is critical, no vote will be taken for granted in these final hours before the Senate committee vote.\

C05772932	CQ TODAY ONLINE NEWS — CONGRESSIONAL AFFAIRS Nov. 10, 2010— 6:25 p.m. House Democrats Plan Schedule for Lame-Duck Session By Alan K Ota, CQ Staff House Democratic leaders on Wednesday outlined a schedule for the lame-duck session that would have lawmakers in town for at least two weeks in November and into early December. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., assistant to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said in an interview after a conference call among Democratic leaders that lawmakers were likely to work through next week, take a week off for the Thanksgiving recess, and return for a second — and, for now, final — week from Nov. 29 to Dec. 3. Van Hollen, who is poised to take over next year as the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, said he was unsure how Democrats would resolve disputes over unfinished business such as tax cuts that are set to expire Dec. 31 and funding for federal programs beyond the stopgap spending measure (PL 111-242) that expires Dec. 3. \We simply identified some of the issues that are out there,\ Van Hollen said of the private leadership chat. \Obviously, the big issue is how we deal with various tax issues. And then theres the issue of an omnibus [spending bill] versus a continuing resolution. There are a lot of other potential issues. Were going to try to get the nutrition bill.\ He was referring to ongoing talks over a possible extension of expiring provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (PL 107-16, PL 108-27), the debate over whether to move an omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2011 or another temporary spending measure, and a stalled child nutrition bill (HR 5504). Van Hollen said that Pelosi, D-Calif., did not bring up the issue of the tough caucus race for minority whip — the second-ranking Democrat in the next Congress — between Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. Both men were on the telephone call, Van Hollen said, but the issue did not come up. Democratic aides said Pelosi has encouraged both men to reach a settlement to avert the potentially bloody intraparty fight. \That wasnt part of the discussion,\ Van Hollen said.

C05773349	sbwhoeop Monday, December 20, 2010 2:40 PM Latest: Max Blumenthal, The Great Fear: Inside the Bizarre Cabal B6 Torngram: Max Blumenthal, The Great Fear By Max Blumenthal Posted on December 19, 2010, Printed on December 20, 2010 http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/ Moments of imperial and economic decline -- according to a recent poll, 65% of Americans now believe this country to be \in a state of decline\ -- can also be periods of cultishness, even of madness incarnate. Such a mood now seems to be spreading through the United States. It's not so surprising, really: Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, fear has been iniiecttcl into this \homeland\ like a drug and a penumbia of official secrecy has settled over the land in a way that makes the secrecy of the Cold War years (when this country faced a superpower, not a ragtag set offihadis, guerrillas, and terrorists) seem like an era of sunshine. In an atmosphere of swirling fears and hysteria amid declining living conditions, \explanations\ that at other times might have remained confined to tiny crews of conspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a patina of plausibility and so traction. No wonder then that, as hard times hit, as the financial system seemed on the verge of collapse, as unemployment soared and a massive wave of home foreclosures swept into view, increasing numbers of Americans became prey to any wacky explanation for our troubles, none more so than the idea that Islam was somehow responsible, that mosques and Islamic centers meant for a sliver of a minority here were capable of imposing anything, no less a way of life on this country, or that Sharia law (of all things) might somehow worm its way into state teal systems, or that YouTube was a hotbed of.terrorism worthy of suppression, or... well, you name it. Max Blumenthal, author of the bestselling book Reptblican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement Thai Shattered the Party, has done the necessary legwork to\take us deep into one of those crews of conspiracy- mongers who, at another time, just about no one would have paid much attention to, but in twenty-first-century America have gained a remarkable audience. They are a chilling barometer of the changing weather in America. Torn The Great Islamophobic Crusade Inside the Bizarre Cabal of Secretive Donors, Demagogic Bloggers, Pseudo- Scholars, European Neo-Fascists, Violent Israeli Settlers, and Republican Presidential Hopefuls Behind the Crusade By Max Blumenthal Nine years after 9/11, hysteria about Muslims in American life has gripped the country. With it has Gone an outburst of arson attacks on mosques, campaigns to stop their construction, and the branding of the Muslim- American community, overwhelmingly moderate, as a hotbed of potential terrorist recruits. The frenzy has raged from rural Tennessee to New York City, while in Oklahoma, voters even overwhelmingly Approved a ballot measure banning the implementation of Sharia law in American courts (not that such a prospect existed). This campaign of islamophobia wounded President Oba.ma politically, as one out of five Americans have bought into a sustained chorus of false rumors about his secret Muslim faith. And it may have tainted views of Muslims in general; an August 2010 Pew Research Center poll revealed that, among Americans, the favorability rating of Muslims had dropped by 11 points since 2005. Erupting so many years after the September 11th trauma, this spasm of anti-Muslim bigotry might seem oddly timed and unexpectedly spontaneous. But think again: its the fruit of an organized, long-term campaign by a tight confederation of right-Wing activists and operatives who first focused on Isia.mophobia soon after the September 11th attacks, but only attained critical mass during the Obama era. It was then that embittered conservative forces, voted out of power in 2008, sought with remarkable success to leverage cultural resentment into political and partisan gain. This network is obsessively fixated on the supposed spread of Muslim influence in America. Its apparatus spans continents, extending from Tea Party activists here to the European far right. It brings together in common cause right-wing ultra- Zionists, Christian evangelicals, and racist British soccer hooligans. It reflects an aggressively pro- Israel sensibility, with its key figures venerating the Jewish state as a Middle Eastern Fort Apache on the front lines of the Global War on Terror and urging the U.S. and various European powers to emulate its heavy-handed methods. Little of recent American Jslamophobia (with a.strong emphasis on the \phobia\) is sheer happenstance. Years before Tea Party shock troops massed for angry protests outside the proposed site of an Islamic community center in lower Manhattan, representatives of the Israel lobby and the Jewish-American establishment launched a campaign against pro- Palestinian campus activism that would prove a seedbed for everything to come. That campaign quickly -- and perhaps predictably -- morphed into a series of crusades against mosques and islarilic schools which, in turn, attracted an assortment of shady but exceptionally energetic militants into the networks ranks. Besides providing the initial energy for the islamophobic crusade, conservative elements from within the pro-Israel lobby bankrolled the networks apparatus, enabling it to influence the national debate. One philanthropist in particular has provided the beneficence to propel the campaign ahead. He is a little-known Los Angeles- area software security entrepreneur named Aubrey Chernick, who operates out of a security consulting firm blandly named the National Center for Crisis and Continuity Coordination. A former trustee of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which has served as a think tank for the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a frontline lobbying group for Israel, Chernick is said to be worth $750 million. Chemicks fortune is puny compared to that of the billionaire Koch Brothers, extraction industry titans who fund Tea Party-related groups like Americans for Prosperity, and it is dwarfed by the financial empire of Haim Saban, the Israeli- American media baron who is one of the largest.-orivate donors to the Democratic party and recently matched $9 million raised for the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces in a single night. However, by injecting his money into a small but influential constellation of groups and individuals with a narrow agenda. Chernick has had a considerable impact. Through the Fairtmook Foundation, a private entity he and his wife Joyce control, Chernick has provided funding to groups ranging from the Anti- Defamation League (ADL) and CAMERA, a right- wing, pro-Israel, media- watchdog outfit, to violent Israeli settlers living on Palestinian lands and figures like the pseudo-academic author Robert Spencer, who is largely responsible for popularizing conspiracy theories about the coming conquest of the West by Muslim fanatics seeking to establish a worldwide caliphate. Together, these groups spread hysteria about Muslims into Middle American communities where immigrants from the Middle East have recently settled, and they watched with glee as likely Republican presidential frontrunners from Mike Huckabee to Sarah Palin pmmoted their cause and oarpe.ki their tropes. Perhaps the only thing more surprising than the increasingly widespread appeal of islamophobia is that, just a few years ago, the phenomenon was confined to a few college campuses and an inner city neighborhood, and that it seemed like a fleeting fad that would soon pass from the American political landscape. Birth of a Network The fslamophobic crusade was launched in earnest at the peak of George W. Bushs prestige when the neoconservatives and their allies were riding high. In 2003, three years after the collapse of President Bill Clintons attempt to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue and in the immediate wake of the invasion of Iraq, a network of Jewish groups, ranging from ADL and the. American Jewish Committee to AIPAC, gathered to address what they saw as a sudden rise in pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses nationwide. That meeting gave birth to the David Project, a campus advocacy group led by Charles Peters, who had co-founded CAMERA, one of the many outfits bankrolled by Chernick. With the help of public relations professionals,. Peters ci a plan to \take back the campus by influencing public opinion through lectures. the Internet, and coalitions,\ as a memo produced at the time by the consulting firm McKinsey and Company stated. In 2004, after conferring with Martin Kramer, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the pro-Israel think tank Where Chernoff had served as a trustee, Peters produced a documentary film that he called Columbia \rbecornint., It was -filled with claims from Jewish students at Columbia University claiming they had endured intimidation and insults from Arab professors. The film portrayed that New York City school's Department of Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures as a hothouse of anti-Semitism. In their complaints, the students focused on one figure in particular: Joseph .vlassa.d, a Palestinian professor of Middle East studies. He was known for his passionate advocacy of the formation of a binational state between Israel and Palestine, as well as for his strident criticism of what he termed \the racist character of Israel.\ The film identified him as \one of the most dangerous intellectuals on campus,\ while he was featured as a crucial villain in The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America, a book by the (Chemick-•funded) neoconservative activist David Horowitz. As Massad was seeking tenure at the time, he was especially vulnerable to this sort of wholesale assault. When the controversy over Massad's views intensified, Congressman Anthony Weiner, a liberal New York Democrat who pqee :lescri himself as a representative of \the ZOA [Zionist Organization of America] wing of the Democratic Party,\ demanded that Columbia President Lee Bollinger, a renowned First Amendment scholar, fire the professor. Bollinger responded by issuing uncharacteristically defensive statements about the \limited\ nature of academic freedom. In the end, however, none of the charges stuck. Indeed, the testimonies in the David Project film were eventually either discredited or never corroborated. In 2009, Massad earned tenure after winning Columbia's prestigious Lionel Trilling Award for excellence in scholarship. Having demonstrated its ability to intimidate faculty members and even powerful university administrators, however, Kramer claimed a moral victory in the name of his project, boasting to the press that \this is a turning point.\ While the David Project subsequently fostered chapters on campuses nationwide, its director set out on a different path -- initially, into the streets of Boston in 2004 to oppose the construction of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center. For nearly 15 years, the Islamic Society of Boston had sought to build the center in the heart of Roxbury, the city's largest black neighborhood, to serve its sizable Muslim population. With endorsements from Mayor Thomas Menino and leading Massachusetts lawmakers, the mosque's construction seemed like a fait accompli - - until, that is, the Rupert Murdoch-owned Boston Herald and his local Fox News affiliate snapped into action. Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby also chimed in with a series of reports claiming the center's plans were evidence of a Saudi Arabian plot to bolster the influence of radical Islam in the United States, and possibly even to train underground terror cells. It was at this point that the David Project entered the fray, convening elements of the local pro-Israel community in the Boston area to seek strategies to torpedo the project. According to emqiis obtained by the Islamic Society's lawyers in a lawsuit against the David Project, the organizers settled on a campaign of years of nuisance lawsuits, along with accusations that the center had received foreign finding from \the Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia or... the Moslem Brotherhood.\ In response, a grassroots coalition of liberal Jews initiat4d inter-faith efforts aimed at ending a controversy that had essentially been manufactured out of thin air and was corroding relations between the Jewish and Muslim communities in the city. Peters would not, however, relent. 'We are more concerned now than we have ever been about a Saudi influence of local mosques,\ he ,apounced at a suburban Boston synagogue in 2007. After paying out millions of dollars in legal bills and enduring countless smears, the Islamic Society of Boston completed the construction of its community center in 2008. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, nothing came of the David Projects dark warnings. As Boston-area National Public Radio reporter Philip Martin reflected in September 2010, \The horror stories that preceded [the centers] development seem shrill and histrionic in retrospect.\ The Network Expands This second failed campaign was, in the end, more about movement building than success, no less national security. The local crusade established an effective blueprint for generating hysteria against the establishment of Islamic centers and mosques across the country, while galvanizing a cast of characters who would form an anti-Muslim network which would gain attention and success in the years to come. In 2007, these figures coalesced into a proto- movement that launched a new crusade, this time targeting. the Khalil Gibran International Academy, a secular Arabic-English elementary school in Brooklyn, New York. Calling their ad hoc pressure group, Stop the Madrassah madrassah being simply the Arab word for \school\ - - the coalition's activists included an array of previously unknown zealots who made no attempt to disguise their extreme views when it came to Islam as a religion, as well as Muslims in America. Their stated goal was to challenge the school's establishment on the basis of its violation of the church-state separation in the U.S. Constitution. The true aim of the coalition, however, was transparent: to pressure the city's leadership to adopt an antagonistic posture towards the local Muslim community. The activists zeroed in on the school's principal, Debbie Almontaser, a veteran educator of Yemeni descent, and baselessly .branded her \a jihadist\ as well as a 9/11 denier. They also accused her of-- as Pamela Geller, a far-right blogger just then gaining prominence put it, \whitewash[ing] the genocide against the Jews.\ Daniel Pipes, a neoconservative academic previously active in the campaigns against Joseph Massad and the Boston Islamic center (and whose pro-Likud think tank, Middle East .Forum, has received $150,000 from Chernick) Jamed the school should not go ahead because \Arabic-language instruction is inevitably laden with Pan-Arabist and Islamist baggage.\ As the campaign reached a fever pitch, Almontaser reported that members of the coalition were actually stallsinQ her wherever she went. Given what Columbia Journalism School professor and former New York Times reporter Samuel Freedman called \her clear, public record of interfaith activism and outreach,\ including work with the New York Police Department and the Anti-Defamation League after the September 11th attacks, the assault on .Almontaser seemed little short of bizarre -- until her assailants discovered a photograph of a T-shirt produced by AWAAM, a local Arab feminist organization, that read \Intifada NYC.\ As it turned out, AWAAM sometimes shared office space with a Yemeni- American association on which Almontaser served as a board member. Though the connection seemed like a stretch, it promoted the line of attack the Stop the Madrassah coalition had been seeking. Having found a way to wedge the emotional issue of the Israel-Palestine conflict into a. previously New York-centered campaign, the school's opponents next gained a platform at the Murdoch- owned New York Post, where reporters Chuck Bennett and Jana Winter claimed her T-shirt was \apparently a call for a Gaza-style uprising in the Big Apple.\ While Almontaser attempted to explain to the Post's reporters that she rejected terrorism„ the Anti- Defamation League chimed. in on cue. ADL spokesman Oren Segal told the Post: \The T-shirt is a reflection of a movement that increasingly lauds violence against Israelis instead of rejecting it. That is disturbing.\ Before any Qassam rockets could be launched from Almontaser's school, her former ally New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg caved to the growing pressure and threatened to shut down the school, prompting her to resign. A Jewish principal who spoke no Arabic replaced Almontaser, who later filed a lawsuit against the city for breaching her free speech rights. In 2010, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ui that New York's Department of Education had \succumbed to the very bias that the creation of the school was intended to dispel\ by firing Almontaser and urged it pay her $300,000 in damages. The commission also concluded that the Post had quoted her misleadingly. Though it failed to stop the establishment of the Khalil Gibran Academy,•the burg:eoning anti-M sliin movement succeeded in forcing city leaders to bend to its will, and having learned just how to do that, then moved on in search of more high-profile targets. As the ,New York Times s!..t_..at the time, \The fight against the school... was only an early skirmish in a broader, national struggle.\ s a battle that has really just begun.\ Pipes told the Times. From Scam to Publicity Coup Pipes couldnt have been more on the mark. In late 2009, the Isiamophobes sprang into action again when the Cordoba Initiative, a non-profit Muslim group headed by Feisai Abdul Rauf, an exceedingly moderate Sufi Muslim imam who regularly lepic,,etiting the United States at the behest of the State Department, announced that it was going to build a community center in downtown New \NCork City. With the help of investors, Raufs Cordoba Initiative purchased space two blocks from Ground Zero in Manhattan. The space was to contain a prayer area as part of a large community center that would be open to everyone in the neighborhood. None of these facts mattered to Pamela Geller. Thanks to constant prodding at her Nog, Atlas Shrugged. Geller made Cordobas construction plans a national issue, provokino fervent calls faml conservatives to protect the \hallowed ground\ of 9/11 from creeping Sharia. (That the \mosque\ would have been out of sight of Ground Zero and that the neighborhood was, in fact. everything from strip clubs to fast-food joints didnt matter.) Gellers activism against Cordoba House earned the 52-year-old full- time blogger the attention she apparently craved., including a • 1 in the Neu, York ThIleS and frequent cable news spots, esoeciallv, of course, on Fox News. Mainstream reporters tended to focus on Gellers bizarre stunts. She posted a video of herself in a string bikini on a Fort Lauderdale beach, for instance, while ranting about \left-tards\ and \Nazi Hezbollah.\ Her gall for boycotting Campbells Soup because the company offered halal -- approved under Islamic law (as kosher food is under Jewish law) -- versions of its products got her much attention, as did her .cron-lotior of a screed claiming that President Barack Obama was the illegitimate lovechild of Malcolm X. Geller had never earned a living as a journalist. She supported herself with millions of dollars in a divorce settlement and life insurance money from her ex-husband. He died in 2008, a year after being for an alleged $1.3 million scam he was accused of-running out of a car dealership he co-owned with Geller. Independently wealthy and with time on her hands, Geller proved able indeed when it came to exploiting her strange media stardom to in.cite the already organized political network of islamophobes to intensify their crusade. She also benefited from close alliances with leading islamophobes from Europe. Among Ochers allies was Andrew Gravers, a Danish activist who formed the group Stop the Islamicization of Europe, and :.1a.-ye it the unusually blunt motto: \Racism is the lowest form of human stupidity, but Islamophobia is the height of common sense.\ Gravers group inspired Gellers own U.S.- based outfit, Stop the Islamicization of America, which she formed with her friend Robert Spencer, a pseudo-scholar whose bestselling books, including The Truth About Muhammad, Founder of the Worlds Most Intolerant Religion, prompted former advisor to President Richard Nixon and Muslim activist Robert Crane to ca/1 \the principal leader... in the new academic .field of Muslim bashing.\ (According to the website almost $1 million in donations from Chernick has been steered to Spencers Jihad Watch group through David Horowitzs Freedom Center.) Perfect sources for Republican political figures in search of the next hot- button cause, their rhetoric found its way into the talking points of Newt Gingrich and Sarah Patin as they propelled the crusade against Cordoba House into the national spotlight. Gingrich soon pared the community center to a Nazi sign next to the Holocaust Memorial Museum, while Patin called it \a stab in the heart\ of \the Heartland.\ Meanwhile, Tea Party candidates like Republican Ilario Pantano, an Iraq war veteran who killed two unarmed Iraqi civilians, shooting them 60 times -- he even stopped to reload made their opppsition to Cordoba House the centerpiece of midterm congressional campaigns conducted hundreds of miles from Ground Zero. Gellers campaign against \the mosque at Ground Zero\ gained an unexpected assist and a veneer of legitimacy from established Jewish leaders like Anti- Defamation League National Director Abraham Foxman. \Survivors of the Holocaust are entitled to feelings that are irrational,\ he et.:narked to the New York Times. Comparing the bereaved family members of 9-1 1 victims to Holocaust survivors, Foxman insisted, \Their anguish entitles them to positions that others would categorize as irrational or bigoted.\ Soon enough, David Harris, director of the (Chernick- funded) American Jewish Committee, was demanding that Cordobas leaders be compelled to reveal their \true attitudes\ about Palestinian militant groups before construction on the center was initiated. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles, another major Jewish group, insisted it would be \insensitive\ for Cordoba to build near \a cemetery,\ though his organization had recently been granted permission from the municipality of Jerusalem to build a \museum of tolerance\ to be called The Center for Human Dignity directly on top of the Mamilla Cemetery, a Muslim Graveyard that contained thousands of grave sites dating back 1,200 years. Inspiration from Israel It was evident from the involvement of figures like Gravers that the Islamophobic network in the United States represented a trans-Atlantic expansion of simmering resentment in Europe. There, the far-right was storming to victories in parliamentary elections across the continent in part by appealing to the simmering anti-Muslim sentiments of voters in rural and working-class communities. The extent of the collaboration between European and American Islamophobes has only continued to grow with Geller, Spencer, and even Gingrich standing beside Europes most prominent anti-Muslim figure, Dutch pad iamentarian Geed Wilders, at a rally against Cordoba House. In the meantime. Geller was issuing statements of sunport for the Emdish Defense League, a band of uoorlstruc[ed riec)-Nazis and former members of the whites-only British National Party who intimidate Muslims in the streets of cities like Birmingham and London. In addition, the trans- Atlantic Islamophobic crusade has stretched into Israel, a country that has come to symbolize the networks fight against the Muslim menace. As Geller told the New York Times Alan Feuer, Israel is \a very good guide because, like I said, in the war between the civilized man and the savage, you side with the civilized man.\ EDL members regularly wave Israeli flags at their rallies, while Wilders claims to have formed his views about Muslims during the time he worked on an Israeli cooperative farm in the 1980s. He has, he says, visited the country more than 40 times since to meet with rightist political allies like Aryeh Eldad, a member of the Israeli Knesset and leader of the far right Hatikvah faction of the National Union Party. He has called for forcibly \transferring\ the Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied West Bank to Jordan and Egypt. On December 5th, for example, Wilders traveled to Israel for a ffrjend nieei,imr, with Foreign Minister Avi2clor Lieberman, then declared at a press conference that Israel should annex the West Bank and set up a Palestinian state in Jordan. In the apocalyptic clash of civilizations the global anti- Muslim network has sought to incite, tiny armed Jewish settlements like Yitzar, located on the hills above the occupied Palestinian city of Nablus, represent front- line fortresses. Inside Yitzars state-funded yeshiva, a rabbi named Yitzhak Shapira has instructed students in what rules must be applied when considering killing non- Jews. Shapira summarized his opinions in a widely publicized book. Torat HaMelech, or The Kings Torah. Claiming that non- Jews are \uncompassionate by nature,\ Shapira cited rabbinical texts to declare that gentiles could be killed in order to \curb their evil inclinations.\ \There is justification,\ the rabbi proclaimed, \for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us, and, in such a situation they' may be harmed deliberately, and not only during combat with adults.\ In 2006, the rabbi was briefly held by Israeli police for urging his supporters to murder all Palestinians over the age of 13. Two years later, according to the Israeli newspaper Ilaaretz, he a rabbinical letter in support of Israeli Jews who had brutally assaulted two Arab youths on the countrys Holocaust Remembrance Day. That same year, Shapira was arrested as a suspect in helping a rocket attack against a Palestinian village near Nablus. Though he was not charged, his name came up again in connection with another act of terror when, in January 2010, the Israeli police raided his settlement seeking vandals who had set fire to a nearby mosque. One of Shapiras followers, an American immigrant, Jack _Mite\, has confessed to murdering two innocent Palestinians and attempting to the kill the liberal Israeli historian Ze'ev Sternhell with a mail bomb. What does all this have to do with Islamophobic campaigns in the United States? A great deal, actually. Through New York-based tax-exempt non- profits like the Central Fund of Israel and Ateret Cohenim, for instance, the omnipresent Aubrey Chernick has sent tens of thousands of dollars to support the Yitzar settlement, as well as to the messianic settlers dedicated to \Judaizing\ East Jerusalem. The settlement movement's leading online news magazine. Arutz Sheva, has feattired Geller as a columnist. A friend of Geller's, Beth Gili.nsky, a right-wing activist with a group called the Coalition to Honor Ground Zero and the founder of the Jewish Action Alliance (apparently ttun. out of a Manhattan real estate office), organized a large rally in New York City in April 2010 to protest the Obama administration's call for a settlement freeze. Among Chemick's major funding recipients is a supposedly \apolitical\ group called Aish. Hatorah that claims to educate Jews about their heritage. Based in New York and active in the fever swamps of northern West Bank settlements near Yitzar, Aish Hatorah shares an address and staff with a shadowy foreign non-profit called the Clarion Fund. During the 2008 U.S. election campaign, the Clarion Fund distributed 28 million DVDs of a propaganda film called Obsession as newspaper inserts to residents of swing states around the country. The film featured a who's who of anti-Muslim activists, including \Valid Shoebat, a self-proclaimed \former PLO terrorist.\ Among Shoebat's more striking statements: \A secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than is Islamofascism today.\ At a Christian gathering in 2007, this \former Islamic terrorist\ told the crowd that Islam was a \satanic cult\ and that he had been born again as an evangelical Christian. In 2008, however, the Jerusalem Post, a right- leaning newspaper, exposed h rn as a fraud, whose claims to terrorism were fictional. Islamophobic groups registered only a minimal impact during the 2008 election campaign. Two years later, however, after the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives in midterm elections, the network appears to have reached. critical mass. Of course, the deciding factor in the election was the economy, and in two years, Americans will likely vote their pocketbooks again. But that the construction of a single Islamic community center or the imaginary threat of Sharia law were issues at all reflected the influence of a small band of locally oriented activists, and suggested that when a certain presidential candidate who has already been demonized as a crypto- Muslim runs for reelection, the country's most vocal Islamophobes could once again find a national platform amid the frenzied atmosphere of the campaign. By now, the Islamophobic crusade has gone beyond the right-wing pro-Israel activists, cyber-bigots, and ambitious hucksters who conceived it. It now belongs to leading Republican presidential candidates, top- rated cable news hosts, and crowds of Tea Party activists. As the fervor spreads, the crusaders are basking in the glory of what they accomplished. \I didnt choose this moment,\ Geller mused to the New York Times, \this moment chose me.\ A/lax Blumenthal is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Daily Beast, the Nation, the 114ington Post, the Independent Film Channel, Salon, corn, Al Jazeera English, and other publications.

C05768443	US Congress warns Cameron over danger of failed Ulster police deal Yes vote on Hillsborough agreement would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month David Cameron has been given a stark warning from Washington that dissident terrorists will be \emboldened\ to intensify their attacks in Northern Ireland and millions of dollars of US investment will be threatened if he fails to persuade the Tories Ulster Unionist partners to endorse the final stage of the peace process. In a sign of deep unease in Washington at the Tories electoral pact with the UUP, a bipartisan group of US Congress members have demanded Cameron must \aggressively\ encourage his partners to endorse the deal in a vote in the Northern Ireland assembly on Tuesday. \At this defining moment in the peace process, it is crucial that all the political parties speak with one voice about their shared future,\ the members of Congress wrote in a private letter to Cameron. Without a unanimous vote, they said, the provinces elected officials would be sending the wrong message to the people they represent, and to the world. \Dissidents are trying to destabilise the political institutions and turn the clock back ... These dissidents will continue to be emboldened if they sense there is no political unanimity on the way forward ... The challenge of bringing good jobs to Northern Ireland will be made more difficult if potential investors do not believe there is political stability.\ The letter by congressional leaders of the 41 million-strong Irish-American community has been passed to the Guardian before the crucial vote on last months Hillsborough agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists. A yes vote would see policing and criminal justice powers devolved to Belfast next month in what the British government has dubbed the final piece in the jigsaw of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. The congressmen and women, whose views reflect the private misgivings of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, wrote to Cameron after learning that his electoral partners in Northern Ireland were voicing doubts about endorsing the deal. Clinton is said to be alarmed that Cameron has either failed, or not bothered, to warn the UUP of the dangers of obstructing the deal. A Tory source said: \David Cameron has consistently made clear that we support the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers ... We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein. The final details are for the parties in the executive, working as a four-party coalition, to decide. We hope that between now and Tuesday any outstanding issues can be solved.\ The Hillsborough agreement was brokered last month under a system endorsed by the UUP when it was the largest party in Northern Ireland. This says that any change must have the consent of 50% of both the nationalist and Unionist communities and 50% of the assembly. Sir Reg Empey, the UUP leader who was one of the architects of the Good Friday agreement, will meet his partys executive tomorrow night to decide how to vote. The deal could still be passed tomorrow without the support of the UUP because the DUPs 36 assembly members account for more than 50% of the unionist bloc. But there are fears in Washington that a no vote from the UUP, seen as a moribund force until Cameron breathed new life into it, would destabilise many members of the DUP and undermine support for the devolution of policing and criminal justice powers.

Jones PRINCETON, NJ -- A new USA Today/Gallup poll finds Americans saying the Republicans in Congress would do a better job than the Democrats in Congress of handling seven of nine key election issues. The parties are essentially tied on healthcare, with the environment being the lone Democratic stren th. The Republicans advantage on most issues is an indication of the currently favorable political environment for the party. Of particular note is the parity between the two parties on healthcare, an issue on which Americans historically have viewed the Democrats as superior. A similar USA Today/Gallup poll conducted in October 2006, just prior to Democrats major gains in that falls elections, highlights the potential implications of these findings. That poll, which includes several issues measured in the current survey, found the Democrats leading on all eight issues tested at that time, including some usual Republican strengths like terrorism and moral values. With Republicans now having the advantage on most issues, the party may be poised to make major gains in congressional seats, just as the Democrats did in 2006. Indeed, Gallup tracking of registered voters preferences in the 2010 generic ballot for Congress continues to find the Republicans ahead of the Democrats, as it has for the past five weeks. The Economy Matters Most The Democrats advantage on the issue of the environment is likely not something the party can leverage to improve its 2010 electoral fortunes, as Americans rank it at the bottom of the list in terms of its importance to their vote. Rather, economic concerns are paramount, with a majority of Americans rating the economy, jobs, and federal spending (along with government corruption) as extremely important. The Republican advantages on these economic matters range from a low of +5 on jobs to a high of +15 on federal spending. Terrorism -- the issue on which Republicans have the greatest advantage over Democrats -- is rated as very important by 47% of Americans, putting it in the middle of the list. Bottom Line Republicans perceptual advantage on most key election issues reinforces the partys advantageous positioning heading into the stretch run of the 2010 election campaign. It is not clear whether Americans give the Republicans the edge on these issues because they have confidence in the GOP to make progress in addressing the major problems facing the country, or whether the ratings have more to do with the publics frustration with the incumbent Democratic Partys performance to date. The Democrats hopes for improving their fortunes may hinge on convincing voters they have superior plans for jump- starting the economy, the issue of uppermost importance in Americans minds. That could be tough to do when, after nearly 20 months of Democratic leadership in Congress and the White House, Americans opinions of the economy remain negative and have become more pessimistic in recent weeks.

Enjoy! jm 1.Closing Wrap-up Video from Forum (produced by IIP and huge hit) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ8kpXbql1c 2.Thank-you Letter from Cameroon Delegate to Embassy Dear All, Good morning from Washington DC. I trust that we are keeping well. I just want to use this opportunity to say that today we come to the end of the program here on the Presidents Forum. All along this Forum and especially during the White House meeting with President Obama, I have been asking myself what it means to be here in DC and to be representing Cameroon at this forum? I have recently come to the realization that the time is critical and that President Obama in his thinking about a new Africa believes that young people whom we are, diverse and intelligently different can take little positive actions to ensure that the next 50 years witnesses significant changes in our social processes, our political institutions, processes and structures, our economic freedom, taking into consideration our cultural specificities. While traveling to America, I kept imagining the moment when President Obama would tell us great and magical ways to getting out of our current socio-economic and especially political hostage situations, but in all and after all the speeches, conversations and interactions with Ordinary Americans like in the Southside of Washington DC, State Department Staff, Senators, Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, I noticed that America can only partner with us when we decide to start thinking and acting differently in our quest for a better Cameroon and a better Africa. This thinking differently is exemplified by the American Peace Corps, in the service leadership, the spirit of give back to the nation and community and the transformation of challenges to opportunities in America and in many nations around the world... When our troubles and challenges seems gruesome and our vision blurred by the thought and fear of the unknown if we dared, the one thing I come out with from this Forum is this, \That we just have to Think, Speak out and above all, DARE take some innovative ACTIONs to Be the change we want to see in our communities, nations and continent and commit others to same by our examples...That we have to build strong networks and undertake advocacies as a group as nothing has ever stopped a committed group of people to drive change aound the world. The work to be done is enormous and challenging but sure the reward of every success like coming to America, to the White House and meeting with President Obama is sweet. Therefore I come back to work to be the change I want to see in Cameroon. I thank you all for the opportunity.

C05770759	Ebeling, Betsy Thursday, May 27, 2010 4:33 PM H ole0.bmp FISA director leaves legacy of collaboration Breaking down barriers Wednesday, May 26, 2010 By Tina Calabro, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette FISA Foundation retiring executive director Dee Delaney, left, with the new executive director, Kristy Trautmann. To people in the local disability community, Dee Delaney is a household name. When news came this spring of her intention to retire as executive director of FISA Foundation in August, one could almost hear a collective gasp. With 14 years at the helm of the small but influential foundation, Ms. Delaney has had a pronounced and lasting influence on quality of life in our region. On behalf of FISA, Ms. Delaney has changed the local landscape not only by funding projects with far-reaching results, but by bringing people together to craft solutions to longstanding problems and by becoming personally involved in many of the projects the foundation funds. She became the first executive director of FISA Foundation when it began in 1996 with proceeds from the sale of Hannarville Rehabilitation Center, a nonprofit, to HealthSouth, a for-profit organization. The new foundation would continue the mission of the Federation of Independent School Alumnae, an organization that opened a convalescent home for women in 1911 and the Harmarville Rehabilitation Center in 1954. That mission was to improve the lives of women, girls and people with disabilities in Western Pennsylvania. Ms. Delaney, who had been involved with Harmarville since 1980 -- starting as a volunteer and ending as development director of its foundation -- sought the job of leading FISA. \I realized the impact the foundation could have. FISA is not a large foundation, but its a very focused foundation,\ she said. Over the past 14 years, FISAs endowment has grown to more than $38 million. Over $17 million has been granted to 726 projects in 298 organizations. A roll call of projects funded by FISA reflects progressive thinking about including of people with disabilities in all aspects of life, especially access to health care. Programs have become national models. Women with disabilities, for example, often encounter barriers in typical healthcare settings. Standard exam tables and diagnostic equipment were designed for the able-bodied, and medical staff often struggle to accommodate individuals with special needs. FISA provided the seed money for the Center for Women with Disabilities at Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC, one of the first such clinics in the nation. FISA is involved in the overall issue of improving access to healthcare for people with disabilities. Likewise, people with disabilities have difficulty obtaining dental care. A FISA-funded project at Achieva is creating statewide, systemic solutions. FISA also provided support for the Center for Patients with Special Needs at Pitts School of Dental Medicine. FISA has also taken the lead on training arts and cultural venues how to make events more accessible and helping places of worship more welcoming \Dee is a national leader in the field. If there were more people like her, we wouldnt have the issues we have,\ said Kim Hutchinson, executive director of the Disability Funders Network, based in Virginia. Ms. Delaney has been a board officer for the group since 2004. Nancy Murray, president of the ARC of Greater Pittsburgh, said the issues Ms. Delaney has helped solve are ones that people have been working on for years. \People talk about strategies, but never move forward to solutions. Dee brings all the stakeholders together to get to the solutions,\ said Ms. Murray. \I think Dee has greatly influenced the next generation of nonprofit and philanthropic leaders, leading by example on the value of true collaboration,\ said Susie Chase, a board member of FISA and former executive director of Working Order, a FISA grantee. \With Dee, it is never about her own role, or FISAs role, it is always about unmet needs in the community and the work that needs to be done. That seems to bring out the best in every partner, and in everyone who has the privilege of working with her.\ Ms. Chase added that advice and technical assistance Ms. Delaney provided to Working Order \were of equal or greater value to the organization than the grant funds.\ \I still, after many years, never come away from a meeting with Dee that I havent learned something, been inspired to work harder, and understood more clearly the value of someone elses ideas and efforts.\ In her retirement, Ms. Delaney plans to \give back to the community in new ways,\ she said. A new frontier is helping young people with disabilities prepare for employment and leadership. \We have to keep the fire burning.\ On May 19, FISA announced that Kristy Trautmaim, who has served as the foundations program director for six years, was promoted to executive director. \We sought a person who would follow Ms. Delaney's visionary leadership and guide the foundation into the next decade,\ said Jane Burger, who chaired the search committee. \We know that we have found such a person in Kristy Trautmaim. She understands the challenges facing the populations the foundation supports and has the trust of the board and the community.\

Thanks Dan STATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON Release of Aung San Suu Kyl Today I join with billions of people around the world to welcome the long-overdue release of Burmese democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Aung San Suu Kyi has endured enormous personal sacrifice in her peaceful struggle to bring democracy and human rights to Burma, including unjustified detention for most of the past twenty years. The Burmese regime has repeatedly rejected her offers to engage in dialogue and work together, trying instead to silence and isolate her. Through it all, Aung San Suu Kyis commitment to the Burmese people has not wavered. The United States calls on Burmas leaders to ensure that Aung San Suu Kyis release is unconditional so that she may travel, associate with her fellow citizens, express her views, and participate in political activities without restriction. They should also immediately and unconditionally release all of Burmas 2,100 political prisoners. We urge Burmas leaders to break from their repressive policies and begin an inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratic and ethnic leaders towards national reconciliation and a more peaceful, prosperous, and democratic future.

The destruction was part of a larger project to force the Bedouin community of the Negev away from their ancestral lands and into seven Indian reservation-style communities the Israeli government has constructed for them. The land will then be open for Jewish settlers, including young couples in the army and those who may someday be evacuated from the West Bank after a peace treaty is signed. For now, the Israeli government intends to uproot as many villages as possible and erase them from the map by establishing \facts on the ground\ in the form of JNF forests. (See video of of al-Arakib's demolition here). Moments before the destruction of the Bedouin village of al-Arakib, Israeli high school age police volunteers lounge on furniture taken from a family's home. [The following four photos are by Ata Abu Madyam of Arab Negev News. One of the most troubling aspects of the destruction of al-Arakib was a report by CNN that the hundreds of Israeli riot police who stormed the village were accompanied by \busloads of cheering civilians.\ Who were these civilians and why didn't CNN or any outlet investigate further? I traveled to al-Arakib yesterday with a delegation from Ta'ayush, an Israeli group that promotes a joint Arab-Jewish struggle against the occupation. The activists spent the day preparing games and activities for the village's traumatized children, helping the villagers replace their uprooted olive groves, and assisting in the reconstruction of their demolished homes. In a massive makeshift tent where many of al-Arakib's residents now sleep, I interviewed village leaders about the identity of the cheering civilians. Each one confirmed the presence of the civilians, describing how they celebrated the demolitions. As I compiled details, the story grew increasingly horrific. After interviewing more than a half dozen 'elders of the village, I was able to finally identify the civilians in question. What I discovered was more disturbing than I had ima. med. Israeli police youth volunteers pick through the belongings an al-Arakib family Arab Negev News publisher Ata Abu Madyam supplied me with a series of photos he took of the civilians in action. They depicted Israeli high school students who appeared to have volunteered as members of the Israeli police civilian guard (I 'am working on identifying some participants by name). Prior to the demolitions, the student volunteers were sent into the villagers' homes to extract their furniture and belongings. A number of villagers including Madyam told me the volunteers smashed windows and mirrors in their homes and defaced family photographs with crude drawings. Then they lounged around on the furniture of al-Arakib residents in plain site of the owners. Finally, according to Matyam, the volunteers celebrated while bulldozers destroyed the homes. \What we learned from the summer camp of destruction,\ Madyam remarked, \is that Israeli youth are not being educated on democracy, they are being raised on racism.\ (The cover of the latest issue of Madyam's Arab Negev News features a photo of Palestinians being expelled to Jordan in 1948 juxtaposed with a photo of a family fleeing al-Arakib last week. The headline reads, \Nakba 2010.\) 0 According to residents of al-Arakib, the youth volunteers vandalized homes throughout the village The Israeli civilian guard, which incorporates 70,000 citizens including youth as young as 15 (about 15% of Israeli police volunteers are teenagers), is one of many programs designed to incorporate Israeli children into the state's military apparatus. It is not hard to imagine what lessons the high school students who participated in the leveling of al-Arakib took from their experience, nor is it especially difficult to predict what sort of citizens they will become once they reach' adulthood. Not only are they being indoctrinated to swear blind allegiance to the military, they are learning to treat the Arab outclass as less than human. The volunteers' behavior toward Bedouins, who are citizens of Israel and serve loyally in Israeli army combat units despite widespread racism, was strikingly reminiscent of the behavior of settler youth in Hebron who pelt Palestinian shopkeepers in the old city with eggs, rocks and human waste. If there is a distinction between the two cases, it is that the Hebron settlers act as vigilantes while the teenagers of Israeli civilian guard vandalize Arab property as agents of the state. The spectacle of Israeli youth helping destroy al-Arakib helps explain why 56% of Jewish Israeli high school students do not believe Arabs should be allowed to serve in the Knesset — why the next generation wants apartheid. Indeed, the widespread indoctrination of Israeli youth by the military apparatus is a central factor in Israel's authoritarian trend. It would be difficult for any adolescent boy to escape from an experience like al-Arakib, where adults in heroic warror garb encoura e him to articipate in and gloat over acts of massive destruction, with even a trace of democratic values. Youth volunteers extract belongings from village homes as bulldozers move in As for the present condition of Israeli democracy, it is essential to consider the way in which the state pits its own citizens against one another, enlisting the Jewish majority as conquerers while targeting the Arab others as, in the wordsI of Zionist founding father Chaim Weizmann, \obstacles that had to be cleared on a difficult path.\ Historically, only failing states have encouraged such corrosive dynamics to take hold. That is why the scenes from al-Arakib, from the demolished homes to the uprooted gardens to the grinning teens who joined the mayhem, can be viewed as much more than the destruction of a village. They are snapshots of the phenomenon that is laying Israeli society as a whole to waste 0 ...and the destruction begins

From NEA's perspective, an operational liaison with the TNC does not constitute formal, legal recognition of the INC as the government of Libya. We don't consider Chris Stevens' presence in Benghazi to trigger formal recognition, and we've never broken relations with Libya despite suspending our embassy operations. Without question, having a NATO liaison in Benghazi would have the appearance of NATO leaning in the direction of the INC. But NATO's operations already show a considerable lean away from Qadhati.

C05769239	After Afghan Shift, Top U.S. Civilians Face Tricky Future By MARK LANDLER WASHINGTON — As General David H. Petraeus takes command in Afghanistan, the two top American civilian officials in the war face an uncertain and tricky future, working with a newly empowered military leader, under the gaze of an impatient president who has put them on notice that his fractious war council needs to pull together.Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative to the region, and Karl W. Eikenberry, the ambassador to Afghanistan, both hung on to their jobs in the uproar that followed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career-ending quotes in Rolling Stone magazine.But privately, at least one senior White House official suggested using General McChrystal's exit as an excuse for a housecleaning, according to senior officials. That was rejected as too disruptive during a military campaign that relies heavily on civilian support, these people said.ln recent days, other administration officials have begun floating the idea that Ambassador Eikenberry might be replaced by Ryan C. Crocker, the highly regarded former ambassador in Iraq who forged a close partnership with General Petraeus during the successful Iraq troop increase. Such a prospect is viewed as remote, given Mr. Crocker's prestigious new post at Texas A&M University. But the fact that his name is being invoked underlines the challenges that confront Ambassador Eikenberry, as he adapts to a new partner — one who has strong ideas about how soldiers and diplomats should work together in war. It also illustrates the remarkably powerful role that General Petraeus will assume in the nine-year-old war, setting him up as almost a viceroy in Afghanistan and a key broker in negotiations between President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan over an eventual political settlement.Before General Petraeus's arrival, some critics said the White House had created a problem by recruiting several forceful, ambitious personalities and giving them jobs with overlapping responsibilities. Administration officials acknowledge that, as one said, \there are obviously a number of substantial personalities on the team.\ But the White House believes that the current lineup can mesh, and that a difficult war demands this much talent. Still, the McChrystal blow-up has reverberated through the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton instructed Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke to take a hard look at the civilian team, two officials said. She is not wedded to the current lineup if it continues to bog down in internecine battles, they said.\You cant have a major shift in a civ-mil structure without having the civilian side take a step back and look at everything,\ said a senior State Department official, using the jargon for a civilian-military campaign.General Petraeus, whose appointment was approved 99-0 by the Senate on Wednesday, took pains at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday to back a unified civilian and military effort. He noted then that he had telephoned Mr. Holbrooke and would rendezvous with Ambassador Eikenberry in Brussels, so the two could land in Kabul together.\Holbrooke has been my wingman, to a great degree,\ General Petraeus said in an interview. \We have had, and do have, a very good relationship.\ That role, he said, will now fall to Ambassador Eikenberry.Ambassador Eikenberry was highly critical of the Pentagons proposal last year to send 60,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, which led to a difficult relationship with General McChrystal. But in fact General Petraeus was the true architect of the plan.The ambassador, a retired lieutenant general and former commander in Afghanistan, graduated from West Point in 1973, a year ahead of General Petraeus, but they did not know each other at the academy. The two share a scholarly bent: General Petraeus holds a Ph.D. from Princeton, while Ambassador Eikenberry has masters degrees from Harvard and Stanford.While they were never assigned together, their careers intersected twice. In Iraq, General Eikenberry led an assessment of Iraqi security forces while General Petraeus was commanding the 101st Airborne Division in Mosul. When General Eikenberry was commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus led an assessment of Afghan National Security Forces.General Petraeus declined to discuss personnel issues, while Ambassador Eikenberry and Mr. Holbrooke turned down requests for an interview. Mr. Crocker, now the dean of the George Bush School of Government at Texas A&M, did not return a call for comment. For Mr. Holbrooke, the new landscape is challenging in other ways. Officials said his job security was less in doubt than it was six months ago, when his ouster was the subject of Washington chatter. Yet he has arguably become a less central player: Jacob J. Lew, a deputy secretary of state, manages much of the civilian influx in Afghanistan that Mr. Holbrooke helped shape, while the embassy in Kabul is carrying it out. Mr. Holbrookes current portfolio has played to his weaknesses, his own allies admit. He is best as a high-level negotiator, and not as comfortable with the nitty-gritty work of helping Afghanistan build an economy.These days, Mr. Holbrooke has become a globe-trotting diplomat, trying to retain flagging European allies while seeking to draw influential Muslim countries like Egypt into helping Afghanistan. At a recent conference of 35 countries in Madrid, Mr. Holbrooke drummed up more support from allies for the Afghan governments campaign to reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society.Mr. Karzais longer-term effort to reconcile with Taliban leaders, and his negotiations with Pakistan, could propel Mr. Holbrooke back into a central role. Were these talks to become more serious, several officials said, Mr. Holbrookes negotiating skills could be put to use, as a broker and guardian of American interests. For now, though, as evidence of General Petraeuss influence, he will do most of the shuttling between Kabul and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.On his last visit to the region, Mr. Holbrooke met with Mr. Karzai and with senior Pakistani officials, including the army chief of staff, Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. Mr. Holbrookes past run-ins with Mr. Karzai, several officials said, have not hindered his ability to deal with the Afghan leader, and Pakistani officials said they trusted him. Husain Haqqani, Pakistans ambassador to Washington, said that Mr. Holbrooke took time to understand Pakistans concerns. \Ambassador Holbrooke is liked by some, admired by others and seen as effective, even by those who may not like him,\ Mr. Haqqani said.Still, General Petraeus is indisputably the key player, and he has wasted no time asserting his control. On a secure videoconference call last Saturday, a person familiar with the call said, General Petraeus threw his support behind a costly, and controversial, plan to install temporary generators to supply more electricity to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold that is the next major American military target.Mr. Holbrooke and Ambassador Eikenberry swiftly assented.

The fact that China has become the largest foreign holder of U.S. government securities is taken as indicating that the United States is heavily dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. Similarly, since China is a major source for U.S. imports, U.S. consumers are seen as dependent on cheap Chinese goods. In addition, the Chinese authorities have emphasized that they strongly resist external pressures to try to influence policy decisions and that economic instability in China is bad, with adverse implications for the rest of the world. Taken together, these four myths could lead to the conclusion that China should not be pushed hard by the United States (or other major countries) to more quickly change its policies, especially its exchange rate policy, to facilitate the rebalancing of its economy. But such a conclusion would be a major mistake, and that is why during his trip to Asia, President Barack Obama needs to dispel these myths and bring pressure to bear for faster economic policy changes in China. This would be in keeping with the objectives for dealing with global imbalances laid out by the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh in September 2009. Myth No. 1: Washington has limited leverage because China is the main \banker\ for the United States China holds a large amount of U.S. government securities. Of Chinas $2.3 trillion in official reserves, it is estimated that 70 percent is held in U.S. dollar assets. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not Americas banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If China elects not to buy U.S. Treasuries, there are other willing public and private sector buyers, as indicated by the strong demand for these securities worldwide. Although the U.S. government might have to pay higher interest rates as an incentive to get other investors to buy Treasuries in the event that the Chinese reduce their demand, the increase in interest rates would likely be small. Major consequences from a decision by China to reduce its purchases of U.S. Treasury securities would depend on the reason behind the decision. It would be in Chinas best interest (and beneficial for the rest of the world as well) if China reduced its purchases of U.S. Treasuries because it decided to stop heavily managing its exchange rate and allow greater flexibility in the currencys movements. This is an important policy change that is required if China is going to rebalance its economy and be able to sustain rapid growth. China is a big customer for U.S. debt, but it is not Americas banker. Nor is the United States dependent on China to finance its budget deficits. If instead China continues to heavily manage its exchange rate, it will build up large additional amounts of official reserves. If it decides to hold less of these additional reserves in U.S. Treasury securities, then China will increase its purchases of assets denominated in other currencies, with euro-denominated securities being the most likely alternative. In these circumstances, China would continue to intervene in its exchange market, with the central bank buying U.S. dollars for Chinese renminbi and then selling dollars for euro to acquire European assets. The result would be an appreciation of the euro. Consequently, countries in Europe, not the United States, would probably be most affected by Chinas move because the negative impact of euro appreciation on European economic activity would likely far outweigh the effects on the United States of smaller Chinese purchases of Treasuries. Alternatively, China could choose to start dumping its stock of U.S. securities. The result would be appreciation of other major currencies (depending on where China would decide to park its reserve assets); upward pressure on U.S. interest rates; and the possibility of financial market disruptions if China dumped its U.S. dollar assets rapidly. However, the U.S. Federal Reserve could limit the rise in U.S. interest rates and would be able to ensure adequate liquidity to prevent market disruptions. But a decision to dump Treasuries would have a large effect on China itself. The country would incur a substantial capital loss on its reserve assets. The Chinese authorities are deeply concerned about such a loss, and are very unlikely to decide to dump U.S. assets. In fact, the discussion initiated by China regarding the need for an alternative official reserve asset is motivated by its concerns about potential losses on its U.S. dollar holdings. Myth No. 2: The United States is heavily dependent on cheap Chinese goods This is not really true. Only roughly 15 percent of U.S. imports come from China. Moreover, all of the basic types of manufactured consumer goods that China exports to the United States (clothing, textiles, footwear, toys, small appliances, etc.) can be imported from other countries or could be produced domestically. The prices for goods that could substitute for products from China would be higher, but the difference in costs would be relatively small. Competition among producers has become fiercer, and as a result cost differentials between goods from China and other suppliers are narrowing. Dependence actually runs the other way. China is highly dependent on U.S. demand for its products. Economic growth in China is heavily dependent on exports. Although China has been able to achieve its 8 percent GDP growth target in 2009 owing to the stimulus to domestic demand provided by government policy actions, the country will struggle to meet this objective in 2010 and succeeding years if demand for its exports in the United States does not pick up. Myth No. 3: External pressure on China for policy changes is counterproductive. The Chinese authorities stress that in the face of external pressure, they tend to strongly resist economic policy changes. The Chinese have in particular used this argument to try to fend off pressures for appreciation of the exchange rate. While no country wants to appear to be weak and susceptible to external pressure, the truth is that, if there is no pressure, there is less incentive to change policy. This is especially true in China, where the authorities are wedded to the status quo because of past success and inclined to make only gradual changes to economic policies. Recent developments in Chinas exchange rate illustrate this point. In the absence of external pressure since August 2008, China has reverted to fixing its exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in Chinas policies are likely to be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. Myth No. 4: Instability is bad for China Chinese authorities also have suggested that instability in China is bad for the rest of the world because of adverse effects on Chinas growth rate. But instability (or the fear of instability) has played a big role in initiating economic policy changes in China. For example, concern about instability arising from the growing gap between urban and rural incomes has been a major factor behind new initiatives to develop Chinas interior (such as the Develop the West program) and to improve conditions and opportunities for the rural population (including breaking down restrictions and discriminatory treatment of migrant workers). Hence, for China, instability is not necessarily bad, but it is a problem for the authorities. Instability in China also is not necessarily bad for the rest of the world because of its effect on Chinas growth. Although China accounts for a significant portion of world GDP growth, the country does not generate much demand for products from other countries given Chinas large trade and current account surpluses. Some countries in Asia and commodity producers may be benefiting from Chinas strong growth, but overall, it is not providing much stimulus for the world economy as a whole, so slower growth in China will have little effect on economic activity in the rest of the world. It is important for President Obama to separate fact from myth in his economic policy discussions with the Chinese authorities during this trip to Asia to build a sounder relationship. The president should not shy away from pushing the Chinese hard on economic reform and rebalancing of Chinas economy, but this should be done in his private discussions with Chinas senior leaders. Multilateral discussions, such as those in the context of the G-20 process, are a much more effective forum for the United States to take a public stance on Chinas economic policies jointly with other major economies. Without a hard push from the United States on a bilateral and multilateral basis, changes in Chinas policies are likely to be delayed, and that is not in the best interest of the United States and the rest of the world. It also is not in the best interest of China, because without a shift away from heavy dependence on investment and exports to drive growth toward greater reliance on consumption, China will not be able to sustain rapid economic growth and development. Getting China to fully realize this and to act more quickly than the authorities are inclined to do is a considerable task for the United States and other major economies.

This is President Obamas lowest approval rating in any national or statewide Quinnipiac University poll since he was inaugurated and is down from 62 - 31 percent in a May 6 survey. By a small 48 - 46 percen t margin, voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy, the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University poll finds. This is down from a 57 - 36 percent approval May 6. A total of 66 percent of Ohio voters are \somewhat dissatisfied\ or \very dissatisfied\ with the way things are going in the state, while 33 percent are \very satisfied\ or \somewhat satisfied,\ numbers that havent changed since Obama was elected. In the race for Ohios U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring George Voinovich in 2010, Lee Fisher and Jennifer Brunner remain neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination and both would defeat any of the GOP candidates if the election were today. \The economy in Ohio is as bad as anywhere in America. These numbers indicate that for the first time voters have decided that President Barack Obama bears some responsibility for their problems,\ said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \Until now voters have given President Obama high ratings on the economy, blaming former President George W. Bush for their problems. They might be taking out their frustration on President Obama, possibly deciding that the change he promised has not come as quickly as they expected.\ \Ohio historically has been the prototypical swing state. One of the reasons Barack Obama won the p residency by such a wide margin is that he carried Ohio with 52 percent of the vote and captured the lion's share of independent votes,\ Brown added. \Now, by a 48 - 46 percent margin, Ohio independent voters give the President a failing grade on the economy. These numbers indicate that he may be losing, at least for now, some of those who voted for him in November and should be an indication to the White House that his honeymoon with the voters may be ending.\ In the Senate race, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher holds a 24 - 21 percent lead over Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner in the race for the Democratic nomination, with 51 percent undecided. Former U.S. Rep. Rob Portman holds a 33 - 10 percent lead over car dealer Tom Ganley on the Republican side, with 55 percent undecided. In general election trial heats, Brunner would defeat Ganley 35 - 31 percent and get 35 percent to Portmans 34 percent. Fisher leads Ganley 36 - 30 percent and Portman 37 - 33 percent. From June 26 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,259 Ohio voters, with a margin of error of +/- 2.8 percentage points. The survey includes 483 Democrats with a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points and 445 Republicans with a margin of error of +/-4.7 percentage points. The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Florida, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Ohio and the nation as a public service and for research.

C05767355	Northern Ireland agrees power-sharing deal Gordon Brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to Stormont from 12 April • Henry McDonald • quardian.co.uk, Friday 5 February 2010 11.42 GMT • Gordon Brown, the DUP leader, Peter Robinson, and Sinn Feins Martin McGuinness (I to r) talk to the press after the Northern Ireland power-sharing deal was announced. Photograph: Julien Behal/PA Justice and policing powers will be devolved to Northern Irelands power-sharing government from 12 April in a historic deal agreed by the main parties that \opens a new chapter\ after decades of violence, Gordon Brown said today. Standing alongside his Irish counterpart, Brian Cowen, at a press conference at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast, the prime minister said the \inspirational\ agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) was a foundation for lasting peace. The deal — finally agreed to by the DUP last night and described as a final piece in the jigsaw after a long search for peace — comes after two weeks of round-the-clock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the power-sharing government might collapse. It will see policing and justice powers devolved from Westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans on overseeing parades. Brown, who travelled to Belfast this morning, said the agreement had been possible because of \a new spirit of mutual co- operation and respect\. The deal meets a key Sinn Fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the power-sharing executive. In return, the DUP has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in Northern Ireland, including the abolition of the Parades Commission, a body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists. A cross-community vote will now be held in the Stormont assembly on 9 March before the policing and justice powers are devolved from London on 12 April. Brown told reporters: \The achievements have been as great as they are inspirational. This moment and this agreement belongs to the people of Northern Ireland, all of the people, and now more than ever before so does their future ... This is the last chapter of a long and troubled story and the beginning of a new chapter after decades of violence, years of talks, weeks of stalemate.\ Cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making \fair and balanced compromises\ to bridge the divisions and said the quality of the negotiations meant that the \devolved institutions can and will work\. The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days. The deal would \absolutely\ make Northern Ireland a safer place, he said. The DUP leader, Peter Robinson, said the agreement \will be more enduring because of the time spent\ in forming it. Referring back to the Belfast Agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour, the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, described the current deal and the rescue of power-sharing as \yet another very good Friday\. Jeffrey Donaldson told the Guardian the DUPs 36-strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour of the deal. But the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) has yet to officially back the package which will allow the assembly to set up legislation to change the way parades are judged. A UUP spokeswoman said members wanted to see the proposed agreement before giving their response to the two governments. \We have not had sight of this agreement and until we do we will not be signing up to it,\ she said. The talks, which centred on Hillsborough Castle, outside Belfast, are the longest set of continuous negotiations held in the near 20-year peace process. Sinn Fein had accused the DUP of stalling on the transfer of policing powers for the last three years and it was feared that failure to find agreement could see the collapse of the power-sharing government led by the two parties. The agreement finally came near midnight at Stormonts parliament building. Earlier in the evening Sinn Fein had said the basis of a deal was on the table and it was giving the DUP leadership the time to persuade its party to accept it. Robinson emerged from a meeting of party colleagues to confirm that he had secured unanimous support for the proposals. Earlier in the week up to 14 DUP assembly members had opposed a proposed deal because it did not give unionists enough concessions. Robinson said he would now look to gain the support of the community and the smaller assembly parties for the deal. \We have a basis upon which we can go forward and recommend it [the deal] to our party, to the other parties in Northern Ireland and to the community. \An essential element of the Democratic Unionist Partys manifesto is the requirement for community confidence; we believe this can be the basis for gaining that confidence.\ However the leader of the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, questioned why the 14 DUP rebels had changed their minds. \The deal hasnt changed, only the snowmen of the DUP, who melted once the heat came on,\ Allister said. The DUP now faces a struggle to ward off the TUV threat in the forthcoming general election: Allister will portray the deal as a sell-out of unionist principles and a sop to republicanism.

Brazil signals recognition of Honduran election (AP) –40 minutes ago RIO DE JANEIRO —A top Brazilian official has signaled that Latin America's largest nation may recognize the Honduran candidate who won last weekend's post-coup presidential election. Dilma Rousseff is chief of staff for Brazilian President Luiz !neck) Lula da Silva. Rousseff says the Central American country's Nov. 29 election should be considered separately from the June 28 coup that ousted ex-President Manuel Zelaya. Previously, the government had said it would not recognize the election unless Zelaya was returned to office and allowed to serve out his term, which ends Jan. 27. Rousseff told Brazilian television late Friday from Germany that the coup \is one thing\ and \discussing the election\ another. She says \this new process\ — the election — \has to be considered.

It's a fascinating read, and some stuff mentioned has already happened (such as the appointment ofiuwaili as Minister of Defense Juwaili is close to the UAE, incidentally). But I simply do not know the ins and outs of the new Libyan politics in sufficient detail to give a view as to the accuracy of this report A few bits seemed off key (e.g, the reference that both the misrata and Zintan Brigades once reported \loosely\ to BelHaj I don't believe is true, since Juwaili and the IJAE supported the latter and Qatar the former). The comment about Belhaj staying out of govt and thus retain the flexibility to carp and make trouble: Jake, you may remember that AbZ warned exactly of that danger in that weird mtg Qatar insisted upon on the margins of UNGA.

C05771289	I read the Roger Cohen piece and agree that it is v smart. And I've been thinking about the need for a headline/bumper sticker for the speech. How about \A New American Century\? We cd take on the critics directly and right up front and make the argument this way (a lot of this is already in the intro, but wd need to be pulled together differently). 1)We live in a new age of diplomacy - we are seeing the limits of force and we face collective problems that require bringing together a wider array of key players rather than any one nation dictating a solution. Active diplomacy is the only option. (This is the argument david rothkopf was making to mark landler when we thought landler was doing a profile - it resonated v well w/ landler.) 2) The U.S. is uniquely suited to lead in these circumstances. a) In situations where many nations must be brought together that do not trust each other, we are still seen as the most honest broker. b) In situations where many nations are sitting around the table contemplating a common problem, someone has to step forward and take responsibility for mobilizing action (which also includes the risk of failure). We are the nation most willing to do that, both because of our history and our values. (Here is where S can offer personal anecdotes re nations waiting for us to do something) c) in a world of global problems, we are the most global nation, with the greatest global reach, resources, and connections. 3) We see global leadership not only as a responsibility but also as an opportunity, b/c of our native confidence, optimism and faith that problems can be solved. We have a chance to shape a genuinely global agenda, focusing on development as well as traditional national security issues, and mobilizing business and civil society as well as governments. This is our time. The speech would then go on, as it does now, to outline all the ways in which we are building relationships and solving problems now with traditional allies and new powers on the global landscape while building a longer term architecture of cooperation that is both truly global and adapted to solving 21st century problems.

It was cleared by JO, PRM, P, D/L, D/S, AF, and assorted others. The problem is that it was not sent to SCA or East Asia and should have been. But the rest of the building signed off on it. Also, it is clear that the reference in the Security Council statement referred to rapes in the past.The first reference is to rape in the DRC and Sudan. Two sentences later we say: \Weve seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere. \ Can you download these documents if I email them to you?

C05777458	sbwhoeop Saturday, December 4, 2010 7:08 PM H: Kathleen on Palin on JFK. Sid B6 Sarah Palin is wrong about John F. Kennedy, religion and politics By Kathleen Kennedy Townsend Friday, December 3, 2010; 6:00 PM Sarah Palin has found a new opponent to debate: John F. Kennedy. In her new book, \America by Heart,\ Palin objects to my uncle's famous 1960 speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, in which he challenged the ministers - and the country - to judge him, a Catholic presidential candidate, by his views rather than his faith. \Contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president,\ Kennedy said. \I am the Democratic Partys candidate for president who happens also to be a Catholic.\ Palin writes that when she was growing up, she was taught that Kennedys speech had \succeeded in the best possible way: It reconciled public service and religion without compromising either.\ Now, however, she says she has revisited the speech and changed her mind. She finds it \defensive . . . in tone and content\ and is upset that Kennedy, rather than presenting a reconciliation of his private faith and his public role, had instead offered an \unequivocal divorce of the two.\ Palins argument seems to challenge a great American tradition, enshrined in the Constitution, stipulating that there be no religious test for public office. A careful reading of her book leads me to conclude that Palin wishes for precisely such a test. And she seems to think that she, and those who think like her, are qualified to judge who would pass and who would not. If there is no religious test, then there is no need for a candidates religious affiliation to be \reconciled.\ My uncle urged that religion be private, removed from politics, because he feared that making faith an arena for public contention would lead American politics into ill-disguised religious warfare, with candidates tempted to use faith to manipulate voters and demean their opponents. Kennedy cited Thomas Jefferson to argue that. as part of the American tradition, it was essential to keep any semblance of a religious test out of the political realm. Best to judge candidates on their public records, their positions on war and peace, jobs, poverty, and health care. No one, Kennedy pointed out, asked those who died at the Alamo which church they belonged to. But Palin insists on evaluating and acting as an authority on candidates faith. She faults Kennedy for not \telling the country how his faith had enriched him.\ With that line, she proceeds down a path fraught with danger - precisely the path my uncle warned against when he said that a presidents religious views should be \neither imposed by him upon the nation or imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.\ After all, a candidates faith will matter most to those who believe that they have the right to serve as arbiters of that faith. Is it worthy? Is it deep? Is it reflected in a certain ideology? Palin further criticizes Kennedy because, \rather than spelling out how faith groups had provided life-changing services and education to millions of Americans, he repeatedly objected to any government assistance to religious schools.\ She does not seem to appreciate that Kennedy was courageous in arguing that government funds should not be used in parochial schools, despite the temptation to please his constituents. Many Catholics would have liked the money. But he wisely thought that the use of public dollars in places where nuns explicitly proselytized would be unconstitutional. Tax money should not be used to persuade someone to join a religion. As a contrast to Kennedys speech, Palin cites former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romneys remarks during the 2008 Republican primary campaign, in which he spoke publicly of \how my own faith would inform my presidency, if I were elected.\ After paying lip service to the separation of church and state, Romney condemned unnamed enemies \intent on establishing a new religion in America - the religion of secularism.\ \There is one fundamental question about which I am often asked,\ Romney said. \What do I believe about Jesus Christ?\ Romney, of course, is a Mormon. He answered the question, proclaiming that \Jesus Christ is the son of God.\ Palin praises Romney for delivering a \thoughtful speech that eloquently and correctly described the role of faith in American public life.\ But if there should be no religious test in politics, then why should a candidate feel compelled to respond to misplaced questions about his belief in Jesus? When George Romney, Mitt Romneys father, was a presidential candidate in 1968, he felt no such compulsion. Respect for the Constitution and the founders belief in the separation of church and state suggests that those kinds of questions should not play a role in political campaigns. Palin contends that Kennedy sought to \run away from religion.\ The truth is that my uncle knew quite well that what made America so special was its revolutionary assertion of freedom of religion. No nation on Earth had ever framed in law that faith should be of no interest to government officials. For centuries, European authorities had murdered and tortured those whose religious beliefs differed from their own. To demand that citizens display their religious beliefs attacks the very foundation of our nation and undermines the precise reason that America is exceptional. Palins book makes clear just how dangerous her proposed path can be. Not only does she want people to reveal their beliefs, but she wants to sit in judgment of them if their views dont match her own. For instance, she criticizes Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), a Democrat and a faithful Catholic, for \talking the (God) talk but not walking the walk.\ Who is Palin to say what Gods \walk\ is? Who anointed her our grand inquisitor? This is a woman who also praises Abraham Lincolns Second Inaugural, even though Lincoln explicitly declared, \But let us judge not that we not be judged.\ The problem for those setting up a free-floating tribunal to evaluate faith is that, contrary to Lincoln, they are installing themselves as judges who can look into others souls and assess their worthiness. Kennedy did not and would not do that, but not because he was indifferent to faith. In fact, unlike Romney or Palin, in fealty to both his faith and the Constitution, he promised on that day in Houston that he would resign if his religion ever interfered with his duty as president. My uncle was a man who had his faith tested. His brother and brother-in-law were killed in World War II, and his sister died in a plane crash soon after the war. He suffered from painful injuries inflicted during his Navy service when his PT boat was cut in two by a Japanese destroyer. His God did not make life easy but did require a commitment to justice. Americas first and oniy Catholic president referred to God three times in p_;.-: .:1,rai.adcres and invoked the Bibles command to care for poor and the sick. Later in his presidency, 1.-.a ur;:•:-.1uvocaliv. about riohi:s: We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.\ Faith runs as a deep current through my family. Faith inspired my uncles and my fathers dedication to justice. My father, Robert F. Kennedy, on returning from apartheid-era South Africa in 1966, wrote a magazine article titled \Suppose God Is - Black.\ And my uncle Teddy fought for health care for all Americans, even if in her book }Dalin presumes to judge that he took positions \directly at odds with his Catholic faith.\ Teddy Kennedy believed that his stands were at one with his faith. He did disagree with the Roman Catholic hierarchy at times. But as we have seen, the hierarchys positions can change, and in our church, we have an obligation to help bring about those changes. That may not be Palins theology, but the glory of America is its support for those who would disagree - even on the most difficult and personal matters, such as religion. John F. Kennedy knew that tearing down the wall separating church and state would tempt us toward self-righteousness and contempt for others. That is one reason he delivered his Houston speech. Palin, for her part, argues that \morality itself cannot be sustained without the support of religious beliefs.\ That statement amounts to a wholesale attack on countless Americans, and no study or reasonable argument I have seen or heard would support such a blanket condemnation. For a person who claims to admire Lincoln, Palin curiously ignores his injunction that Americans, even those engaged in a Civil War, show \malice toward none, with charity for ail.\ Pal in fails to understand the genius of our nation. The United States is one of the most vibrant religious countries on Earth precisely because of its religious freedom. When power and faith are entwined, faith loses. Power tends to obfuscate, corrupt and focus on temporal rather than eternal purposes. Somehow Palin misses this. Perhaps she didnt read the full Houston speech; she certainly doesnt know it by heart. Or she may be appealing to a religious right that really seeks secular power. I dont know. I am certain, however, that no American political leader should cavalierly - or out of political calculation - dismiss the hard- won ideal of religious freedom that is among our countrys greatest gifts to the world. As John F. Kennedy said in Houston, that is the \kind of America I believe in.\ Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is a former lieutenant governor of Maryland and the author of \Failing Americas Faithful: How Todays Churches Are Mixing God With Politics and Losing Their Wav.\ She will be online on Monday, Dec. 6 at 11 a.m. EST to chat.

It is in the interest of the Palestinians just as it is in ours\... \We did it [the moratorium] in order to give the opportunity to enter direct negotiations without preconditions. Now I expect that the Palestinians show their flexibility and continue with peace talks.\...\Unfortunately, as opposed to us, the Palestinians are just hardening their stance.\ Quote from Yasser Abed Rabbo that Bibi may raise: \The leadership confirms that the resumption of talks requires tangible steps, the first of them a freeze on settlements.

As you know the US has been a strong supporter of a new womens agency at the UN that would provide for an Under Secretary General for womens issues, better coordination and effectiveness and-- consolidation of a group of smaller entities. In bilats today, I learned that some G77 countries are wondering whats in it for them. Theyre not developing countries and theyre not the UK or US. Brazil may be second guessing the creation of the new agency yet this is an agency that will benefit women everywhere. I dont know if youll have an opportunity to say to Brazils leader that we hope the UN womens agency will continue to have their support. In fact Tom Shannon told me that theyre really interested in womens issues and wanted to sign a MOU with us. Sometimes theres a disconnect between NY perm reps and their capitals 2nd, I dont know if youre still going to Chile. If you talk to Bachelet about her future, you can tell that so many govt reps at the UN would like to see her head up the new womens agency. Its not clear if shes even interested. Thx

C05764207	Cc: Berger, Samuel R. HRC: I wasnt satisfied by my answer to your question about how to gain leverage over the Pakistanis to move them to more aggressively pursue AQ. Ive thought about it some more and, while I have no silver bullet, here are some further thoughts. -- My impression is that the Pakistanis have been more cooperative lately in assisting us target some AQ in Pakistan and that, where they hold back, it is less a function of affinity toward AQ and more about with whom AQ is imbedded.. -- In particular, they seem to be more reluctant to target AQ where it is nestled with groups they want to cultivate in the event we \leave\ Afghanistan and they need influence there. They have seen that before and will hedge their bets. -- So the first point is that we have to address the reason why they are holding back. If we can disabuse them of the perception that we are leaving Afghanistan, it will be easier to get the Pakistanis to go after AQ in sanctuaries provided by groups which would be part of a future Afghanistan dominated by the Taliban. -- Second, I believe that coercive measures are more likely to be effective if they are targeted against military leaders who give support to AQ and its allies. Assuming we have adequate intelligence, we can go after bank accounts, travel and other reachable assets of individual Pakistani officers, raising the stakes for those supporting the militants without creating an inordinate backlash . Blunter measures of coercion, like conditioning our assistance, are more likely to be counterproductive. Given the level of distrust for us among the Pakistani people, they would see this as another sharp swing of the U.S. pendulum which would harden their attitudes and make greater cooperation very difficult for the Pakistani people to accept. -- There may be greater leverage in giving the Pakistanis incentives to be more aggressive. Of course, the militarys calculation is most important. Im not sure what is on their shopping list these days but we would need to balance what would move the needle on AQ against undercutting our effort to get them to shift their strategic focus away from India. . At the same time, we can be as forward leaning as possible in support of their counterinsurgency capabilities (equipment, training, whatever material, intelligence and other assistance we can give them if they move into Wazeristan -- including relief for displaced persons). If they finally take that step, we can do all that is possible to demonstrate that our arrows are aligned with theirs.. -- On the civilian side, their desire for greater control over how Kerry-Lugar money can be used can be played to our strategic advantage. If we give them a greater sense that they are directing the use of these funds -- without greatly undercutting their effectiveness -- it strengthens our position to press them on AQ. -- Finally, there is the defining relationship with India. Are there measures that the Indians could take that would reduce Pakistani anxieties about the Indian front and thus better enable them to focus on threats to the East, including both AQ and anti-Indian militant groups like LET? Are there confidence building measures such as information sharing on troop movements that would both reduce uncertainty and support a Pakistani public narrative for a shift in emphasis from India to the militancy? To the extent India seeks to have Pakistan move more vigorously against the militants, they could see such steps as advancing their interests. This is tricky territory but may be worth pursuing.

C05770598	Secretary Clinton and Huma! Hope youre both well. The DVD screener should arrive at Humas sometime this morning. I cant wait for to hear what you think of the film and, if you have the time, how we can strengthen themes and sections to make it a more relevant and effective educational and policy influencing tool. We are currently at various stages of reaching out or building partnerships with a wide variety of organizations from Facing History and Ourselves to JStreet to the Marine Corps to the United Nations (informally) to various think tanks, and human rights organizations. We have big plans for the film and hope to use it as a platform to foster critical cross-cultural conversations. And a disclaimer- the film is still a work in progress. We are drastically changing the intro, moving some sections around, and adding a story about the Marines sending senior Marine Officers to Jordan to negotiate and build partnerships with Al Anbars exiled tribal leaders. I am so excited for you to see it. Have a safe trip, I hope to see you soon, and all the best, Love, Zach Zachary J. Iscol The Editorial Project www.editorialproject.com www.thewesternfrontmovie.com
C05764432	Its quite possibly the best thing written about you as SecState. Were getting it around to friends & family, along with People op-ed and NYT Mag q&a - was a great weekend in terms of positive press. Its 3 a.m. Do You Know Where Hillary Clinton Is? By David Rothkopf Washington Post Sunday, August 23, 2009 When it comes to Hillary Rodham Clinton, were missing the forest for the pantsuits. Clinton is not the first celebrity to become the nations top diplomat -- that honor goes to her most distant predecessor, Thomas Jefferson, who by the time he took office was one of the most famous and gossiped-about men in America -- but she may be the biggest. And during her first seven months in office, the former first lady, erstwhile presidential candidate and eternal lightning rod has drawn more attention for her moods, looks, outtakes and (of course) relationship with her husband than for, well, her work revamping the nations foreign policy. Even venerable publications -- such as one to which I regularly contribute, Foreign Policy -- have woven into their all- Hillary-all-the-time coverage odd discussions of Clintons handbag and scarf choices. Daily Beast editor Tina Brown, while depicting herself as a Clinton supporter, has been scathing and small-minded in discussing such things as Clintons weight and hair, while her \defense\ of Hillary in her essay \Obama's Other Wife\ was as sexist as the title suggests. Indeed, sexism has followed Clinton from the campaign trail to Foggy Bottom, as seen most recently in the posturing outrage surrounding the exchange in Congo when Clinton reacted with understandable frustration to the now-infamous question regarding her husbands views. Major media outlets have joined the gossipfest, whether the New York Times, which covered Clintons first big policy speech by discussing whether she was in or out with the White House, or The Washington Post, where a couple of reporters mused about whether a brew called Mad Bitch would be the beer of choice for the secretary of state. Amid all the distractions, what is Clinton actually doing? Only overseeing what may be the most profound changes in U.S. foreign policy in two decades -- a transformation that may render the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush mere side notes in a long transition to a meaningful post-Cold War worldview. The secretary has quietly begun rethinking the very nature of diplomacy and translating that vision into a revitalized State Department, one that approaches U.S. allies and rivals in ways that challenge long-held traditions. And despite the pessimists who invoked the \team of rivals\ cliche to predict that President Obama and Clinton would not get along, Hillary has defined a role for herself in the Obamaverse: often bad cop to his good cop, spine stiffener when it comes to tough adversaries and nurturer of new strategies. Recognizing that the 3 a.m. phone calls are going to the White House, she is instead tackling the tough questions that, since the end of the Cold War, have kept Americas leaders awake all night. In these early days of the new administration, it has been easy to focus on what Clinton has not achieved or on ways in which her power has been supposedly constrained. Indeed, some of her efforts have been frustrated by difficult personnel approvals or disputes with the White House about who should get what jobs. But this is the way of all administrations. More unusual has been the avidity with which the new president has seized the reins of foreign policy -- more assertively than either George W. Bush or Bill Clinton before him. Obamas centrality amplifies the importance of his closest White House staffers, while his penchant for appointing special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke (on Afghanistan and Pakistan) and George Mitchell (on the Middle East) has been interpreted by some as limiting Clintons role. Given the challenges involved, it was perhaps natural that the White House would have a bigger day-to-day hand in some of the nations most urgent foreign policy issues. But with Obama, national security adviser Jim Jones, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates absorbed by Iraq, Afghanistan and other inherited problems of the recent past, Clintons State Department can take on a bigger role in tackling the problems of the future -- in particular, how America will lead the world in the century ahead. This approach is both necessary and canny: It recognizes that U.S. policy must change to fulfill Obamas vision and that many high-profile issues such as those of the Middle East have often swamped the careers and aspirations of secretaries of state past. Which nations will be our key partners? What do you do when many vital partners -- China, for example, and Russia -- are rivals as well? How must Americas alliances change as NATO is stretched to the limit? How do we engage with rogue states and old enemies in ways that do not strengthen them and preserve our prerogative to challenge threats? How do we move beyond the diplomacy of men in striped pants speaking only for governments and embrace potent nonstate players and once-disenfranchised peoples? In searching for answers, Clinton is leaving behind old doctrines and labels. She outlined her new thinking in a recent speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where she revealed stark differences between the new administrations worldview and those of its predecessors: The recurring themes include \partnership\ and \engagement\ and \common interests.\ Clearly, Madeleine Albrights \indispensable nation\ has recognized the indispensability of collaborating with others. Who those \others\ are is the area in which change has been greatest and most rapid. \We will put,\ Clinton said, \special emphasis on encouraging major and emerging global powers -- China, India, Russia and Brazil, as well as Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa -- to be full partners in tackling the global agenda.\ This is the death knell for the G-8 as the head table of the global community; the administration has an effort underway to determine whether the successor to the G-8 will be the G-20, or perhaps some other grouping. Though the move away from the G-8 began in the waning days of the Bush era, that administration viewed the world through a different lens, a perception that evolved from a traditional great-power view to a pre-Galilean notion that everything revolved around the worlds sole superpower. Obama and Clinton have both made engaging with emerging powers a priority. Obama visited Russia earlier this year and will host Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his first state dinner in November. Clinton has made trips to China and India, and she would have been with Obama in Russia had she not injured her elbow. Both have visited Africa and the Middle East, reaching out to women and the Islamic world. On many critical agenda items -- from a rollback of nuclear weapons to the climate or trade talks -- such emerging powers will be essential to achieving U.S. goals. As a result, weve seen a new American willingness to play down old differences, whether with Russia on a missile shield or, as Clinton showed on her China trip, with Beijing on human rights. At the center of Clintons brain trust is Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former dean of Princetons Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Now head of policy planning at the State Department, Slaughter elaborated on the ideas in Clintons speech. \We envision getting not just a new group of states around a table, but also building networks, coalitions and partnerships of states and nonstate actors to tackle specific problems,\ she told me. \To do that,\ Slaughter continued, \our diplomats are going to need to have skills that are closer to community organizing than traditional reporting and analysis. New connecting technologies will be vital tools in this kind of diplomacy.\ A new team has been brought in to make these changes real. Clinton recruited Alec Ross, one of the leaders of Obamas technology policy team, to the seventh floor of the State Department as her senior adviser for innovation. His mission is to harness new information tools to advance U.S. interests -- a task made easier as the Internet and mobile networks have played starring roles in recent incidents, from Iran to the Uighur uprising in western China to Moldova. Whether through a telecommunications program in Congo to protect women from violence or text messaging to raise money for Pakistani refugees in the Swat Valley, technology has been deployed to reach new audiences. Of course, you need more than new ideas to revitalize the State Department; you need resources, too. The secretary has brought in former Bill Clinton-era budget chief Jack Lew to help her claw back money for statecraft that many in Foggy Bottom feel has been sucked off toward the Pentagon. She has also created special positions to back new priorities, such as Melanne Verveer as ambassador at large for womens issues, Elizabeth Bagley to handle public-private outreach worldwide and Todd Stern as the chief negotiator on climate. Even just a few months in, its clear that these appointments are far from window dressing. Lew, Slaughter and the acting head of the U.S. Agency for International Development are leading an effort to rethink foreign aid with the new Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, an initiative modeled on the Pentagons strategic assessments and designed to review States priorities. Stern has conducted high-level discussions on climate change around the world, notably with China. Clinton made womens issues a centerpiece of her recent 11-day trip to Africa, where she stressed that \the social, political and economic marginalization of women across Africa has left a void in this continent that undermines progress and prosperity.\ Clinton has also signaled the importance of private-sector experience by naming former Goldman Sachs International vice chairman Robert Hormats, a respected veteran of four administrations, to handle economic issues at the State Department, as well as Judith McHale, former chief executive of Discovery Communications, to run public diplomacy. In the same vein, she has opened up Cuba to American telecommunications companies and reached out to Indias private sector on energy cooperation -- showing that this administration will seek to advance national interests by tapping the self-interests of the business community. As with any new administration, there have been inevitable problems. The old campaign teams -- Clintons and Obamas -- still eye each other warily, but this feeling is gradually fading. And by most accounts, the administrations national security team has come together successfully, with Clinton developing strong relationships with national security adviser Jones and Defense Secretary Gates. Her policy deputy, Jim Steinberg, has renewed an old collaboration with deputy national security adviser Tom Donilon; the two of them, working with Obama campaign foreign policy advisers Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert, have formed what one State Department seventh-floor dweller called \a powerful quartet at the heart of real interagency policymaking.\ Henry Kissinger may have overstated matters when he said this is the best White House-State relationship in recent memory, but its not bad, while the State-Pentagon relationship is in its best shape in decades. At the heart of things, though, is the relationship between Clinton and Obama. For all the administrations talk of international partnerships, that may be the most critical partnership of all. So far, according to multiple high-level officials at State and the White House, the two seem aligned in their views. In addition, they are gradually defining complementary roles. Obama has assumed the role of principal spokesperson on foreign policy, as international audiences welcome his new and improved American brand. Clinton thus far has echoed his points but has also delivered tougher ones. Whether on a missile shield against Iran or North Korean saber-rattling, the continued imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma or rape and corruption in Congo, the secretary of state has spoken bluntly on the world stage -- even if it triggered snide comments from North Korea. It is still early, and a presidents foreign policy legacy is often defined less by big principles than by how one reacts to the unexpected, whether missiles in Cuba or terrorism in New York. Promising ideas fail because of limited attention or reluctant bureaucracies, and some rhetoric eventually rings hollow, as the self-congratulatory \smart power\ already does to me. Nevertheless, there is evidence that, seven months into the job, Obamas unlikely secretary of state is supporting and augmenting his agenda effectively. Not as Obamas \other wife,\ not as Bill Clintons wife, not even as a celebrity or as a former presidential candidate -- but in a new role of her own making.

C05761911	FYI
C05766987	Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial: By Michael Posner The Posts Dec. 27 editorial (\Redefining Human Rights\) on the Obama Administrations human rights and democracy policies, and Secretary Clintons recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point: human rights, democracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement each other in the task of making human rights a human reality. President Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together freedom of speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous \Four Freedoms\ speech. At Georgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom. To accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes development in a discussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a crucial avenue for ensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion, association, and speech-in their daily lives. As Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: \Freedom doesnt come in half measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,\ she said. But experience shows us that where broad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures, and governments are more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and fair courts, that help ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to speak freely, to participate in their nation's political process and have access to basic information about government, sustainable development is more likely to occur. At the same time, democracies without development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks, and the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing both simultaneously. As President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, \engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation.\ But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women who worked to advance human rights around the world. To suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which she forcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for any regime, this is an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to ensure that democracy actually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right approach for the Obama Administration and for the 21st century. ###

C05763809	Below is Palau's statement on the recent meeting in the required free association review. The fourth is the key paragraph. Jake, I'll call. Jeff 202-343-2905 o, A Compact of Free Association replaced the United States administration of Palau, islands which the U.S. took in war and subsequently administered for the United Nations. The Compact, which was signed in 1986 and took effect October 1, 1994, includes provisions of various duration. Some are to last at least 50 years, including full U.S. military authority -- although the power of the U.S. to deny access to Palau and its extensive waters by the military of any other nation is to continue in perpetuity. The amounts and types of U.S. budgetary and programmatic assistance to Palau under the Compact are specified for 15 years, but the Compact requires reviews of its terms and the entire relationship on its 15th, 30th, and 40th anniversaries. The reviews are to consider the operating requirements of the Government of Palau and the islands' development. The Compact also commits the U.S. to acting on the findings and to promoting Palau's long-term economic development. A Palauan delegation that included Vice President Kerai Mariur, Chief Representative for Compact Review Joshua Koshiba, Minister of Health Dr. Stevenson J. Kuartei, Palau Community College President Dr. Patrick Tellei, Ambassador to the U.S. Hersey Kyota, Representative to the United Nations Stuart Beck, and their consultants met in Honolulu on July 8-9 in connection with the 15th Anniversary Review with an American delegation that included Department of State Office of Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Affairs Alcy Frelick, the head of the US Delegation, and representatives of the Departments of the Interior and Defense and the Weather and Postal Services. The U.S. delegation made positive statements on a few matters and agreed to discuss some others further. A number of the U.S. delegation's statements, however, evidenced a need for greater study by some U.S. officials of the intent as well as the letter of the Compact, the relationship as a whole, Palau's economic situation and fiscal responsibility commitments, and Palau's contributions to the U.S. and to international harmony -- including sacrifice by Palauans in the U.S. military, the UN international peacekeeping force and Palau's strategic location and posture, and Palau's positions in the U.N. Palau is grateful for its partnership with the U.S. and wants to continue in the association as called for by the Compact, deepen the relationship, and develop its capacities as a freely associated state. It appreciates the more positive expressions of U.S. Secretaries of State Clinton and of the Interior Salazar and congressional leaders of both political parties. Palau fully trusts that reflection will result in an approach to the relationship consistent with the Compact and to positions befitting the great nation that is the United States. Recognizing that the questions of the association are relatively small and unique for the Government of the U.S. and that the U.S. faces many and extraordinary challenges at this time, Palau understands why more deliberation by U.S. officials can be needed. Because of this, because of the confidence that it has in the United States, and because it would not be productive to elaborate with others on the conversations at this stage, Palau's representatives are confining additional comment to official communications.

C05764653	Don't think oscar was able to get this to you before you left. Its a few ny notes from chris falvo before the school event: TO: Secretary Clinton FROM: Chris Falvo DATE: September 8, 2009 RE: NY Local Issues Schools - NYC public schools open on Wednesday, September 9th. As a result, you will be visiting a charter school that opened a couple of weeks ago instead of a public school. Mike Mulgrew, who took over as President of the UFT when Randi left for AFT, will be present at the event and should be acknowledged in your remarks. His aides who you have met numerous times, Dick Riley and Bridget Rein, will also be present. Mike appointed Dick as his press secretary last month. H1N1 - Mayor Bloomberg did a rollout earlier this week on NYC's plans to handle this health concern, and a significant portion discusses schools. Unlike what was done in the Spring, this time closing schools will be a last resort. Reason is that they found kids still contaminate each other by going to movies and playgrounds when the schools are closed, so instead they are asking sick kids to stay home. And if four percent of a student body experiences the flu on a single day, a doctor will visit to monitor the situation. Every student in a NYC school will be offered free H1N1 flu shots or mist once a vaccine is available. Primary day - September 15th is primary day. In addition to Bill Thompson for Mayor, the primary races that have been closely followed are Public Advocate and City Comptroller. Running for Public Advocate are Councilmember Eric Gioia, Councilmember Bill DeBlasio, former Public Advocate Mark Green, and civil rights lawyer Norman Siegel. Running for Comptroller are four Councilmembers: John Lui, Melinda Katz, David Yassky, and David Weprin. Rangel - As of last week House Speaker Pelosi plans to allow Rep. Rangel to keep his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee despite his ethics problems. According to amended forms recently filed with the House, Rangel failed to disclose at least $800,000 in assets and income since 2002. This comes amid a House ethics investigation into his failure to report income from and pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic and his ties to a real-estate developer who leased him four rent-stabilized apartments in New York. The panel is also looking into Rangel's fundraising and whether he improperly used his office to raise money for a public policy center in his name at the City University of New York. Rangel has denied any wrongdoing and says its accounting mistakes and simple oversights. The NY Post and Buffalo News have called for his resignation. Speaking at a health-care forum in Washington Heights last Tuesday, Rangel said that bias and prejudice toward Obama are fueling opposition to health-care reform. \Some Americans have not gotten over the fact that Obama is president of the United States. They go to sleep wondering, How did this happen? \ Rangel said. Rangel then likened the battle over health-care expansion for the uninsured to the fight for civil rights. \Why do we have to wait for the right to vote? Why cant we get what God has given us? That is the right to live as human beings and not negotiate with white southerners and not count the votes. Just do the right thing,\ he said. After the forum, Rangel insisted he was not smearing opponents as racists. \What Im saying is, if you watch the town-hall meetings, people were angry and did not care what the answer was to some of their questions. They were angry with their member of Congress, period,\ he said. Rangel's comments came less than two weeks after Governor Paterson claimed he has been the victim of a racist white media -- and also suggested that opposition to Obama's plan is racially driven. The White House disagreed with Paterson's comments. 120 Little League World Series - Staten Island's little league team, the South Shore Nationals, made it to the Little League World Series, but they lost the title two weeks ago with a 4-1 loss to the Southwest Regional Champs, McAllister Park American, from San Antonio. 9/11 - Jay Winuk, founder of the My Good Deed organization, and brother of 9/11 victim, Glenn Winuk, notified us that DOJ has finally award his brother the 9/11 Heroes Medal of Valor. You were very supportive of Jay's efforts and wrote letters to DOJ. Glenn worked at a law firm near the WTC, but was also a volunteer FF. After helping to evacuate his building he went to the WTC area to help and unfortunately died when the South Tower fell. Senator Schumer and Rep Pete King held a press conference on Tuesday making the announcement at a park named in Glenn's honor in their hometown of Jericho, Long Island. Fyi, Jay will be at Friday's 9/11 Servicenation event. 121

Go back to your proposals on revival of manufacturing sector, too. What is Bill's program on lm jobs you mentioned? If they won't listen, he should simply do an op-ed. Sid Does Thomas Friedman Have to Talk to \Senior Economic Policy Makers\ to Get So Many Things Wrong? Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC. Wednesday, 18 August 2010 04:04 Thomas Friedman begins his oiece 1Q(44v by telling readers that: \over the past few weeks Ive had a chance to speak with senior economic policy makers in America and Germany.\ This might lead readers to believe that he is about to share some great insights that would only be possible for someone with special access to these senior economic policy makers. Readers with this expectation will be seriously disappointed. There is nothing here that is more insightful than what can be found on the Washington Posts editorial pages on an average workday. Friedman rehashes the usual cliches, with the usual lack of thought. In doing so, he gets both the story of the recent past and the present seriously wrong. Starting with the past, he badly misrepresents the prior business cycle: \we've just ended more than a decade of debt-fueled growth during which we borrowed money from China to give ourselves a tax cut and more entitlements but did nothing to curtail spending or make long-term investments in new growth engines.\ The main problem facing the U.S. economy of the last decade was a lack of demand. This was in large part due to the fact that China lent to us. Chinas lending was its policy of propping up the value of the dollar in order to maintain its export market in the United States. (At the start of the decade, the Clinton administration had also tried to promote an over-valued dollar.) The over-valued -U.S. dollar made imports from China and other countries very cheap in the United States and made our exports expensive in other countries. This led to a large and growing trade deficit over most of the business cycle. The trade deficit replaced domestic demand, preventing the economy from approaching normal levels of employment (even with the boost from the housing bubble) until just before the crash. There is no reason whatsoever to believe that Chinas decision to prop up the dollar was in any way affected by the Bush tax cuts. In other words, neither the Bush tax cuts nor the growth in entitlements had anything to do with our borrowing from China. The issue was Chinas decision to lend and thereby prop up the dollar. Given the weakness of demand through most of the decade, these expenses could have been easily filled by domestic production without borrowing from abroad. Friedman does no better when he shifts the discussion from the past to the present. He refers to businesses reluctance to hire as the result of \unusual uncertainty,\ a phrase attributed to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bemanke. Of course there is no reluctance to hire, there is simply a lack of demand for labor. A reluctance to hire would be reflected in an increasing number of hours per worker, as employers sought to meet their demand for labor by working the existing workforce more hours. This is not happening. There is a modest uptick in hours from the low point of the downturn, but the increase in hours per worker is certainly no more rapid than in other recessions and the average workweek is still far shorter in just about every sector than it was before the downturn. Later he tells readers: \America's solvency inflection point is coinciding with a technological one. Thanks to Internet diffusion, the rise of cloud computing, social networking and the shift from laptops and desktops to hand-held iPads and iF'hones, technology is destroying older, less skilled jobs that paid a decent wage at a faster pace than ever while spinning off more new skilled jobs that pay a decent wage but require more education than ever.\ This is a great story -- social networking is soaring, IPads are everywhere -- does Friedman have any evidence whatsoever that this development has increased the demand for educated workers and reduced the demand for less educated workers? If so, this would be the place in his column to present the evidence. Otherwise, readers might think that the 4.7 percent unemployment rate for college grads (nearly triple the pre-recession level), coupled with a decline in their real wages over the decade, implies a reduced demand for the labor of highly educated workers as well as less educated workers. Friedmans proposed fix also seems a bit wide of the mark. He insists: \There is only one way to deal with this challenge: more innovation to stimulate new industries and jobs that can pay workers $40 an hour, coupled with a huge initiative to train more Americans to win these jobs over their global competitors. There is no other way.\ We better hope there is another way. A wage of $40 an hour would put a worker well over the 90th percentile on the wage distribution. Even if we double the number of jobs in this pay range -- an incredible accomplishment -- what happens to the other 80 percent of the workforce? Friedman then warns us of the challenge from Europe by getting Germanys past and present wrong: \Keeping up with Germany won't be easy. A decade ago Germany was the 'sick man of Europe.' No more. The Germans pulled together. Labor gave up wage hikes and allowed businesses to improve competitiveness and worker flexibility, while the government subsidized firms to keep skilled workers on the job in the downturn.\ Germany clearly has done sorne changes that benefited its economy, like work sharing, and some that havent, but its past as the \sick man of Europe\ is an invention of Friedman or his highly placed sources. Germany always ran a trade surplus. That is the most basic measure of a countrys competitiveness: foreigners are buying its goods. Germanys unemployment rate in 2.000 ayeravd 7 .,5_percept, not hugely different than its current 7.0 percent rate. The story here is that Friedman seems to have completely missed the basics of the current economic crisis in spite of his weeks of conversing with senior economic policy makers. The current crisis is due to a lack of demand pure and simple. If we generate demand either through more expansionary Fed monetary policy, greater fiscal stimulus, or increased exports due to a falling dollar, there is no reason to believe that the economy will not return to high levels of employment. Certainly Friedman has presented no evidence that increased demand will not generate increased employment as it always has. The longer term debt problem is overwhelmingly a health care story. Apparently Mr. Friedmans sources dont have access to documents like the Medicare trustees report, which imply that U.S. health care costs will be controlled and there will be no serious long-term deficit problem. This may prove -Wrong, but it seems that it would have at least been worth noting in his column. Of course, if we have not fixed our health care system, we can always achieve huge saving by retyinq on the more efficient health care systems in other countries. If Friedmans intention was to scare us, he succeeded. After all, if senior economic policy makers in the U.S. and Germany are as badly misinformed as Friedman implies, then we can expect some very had times ahead.

V5- rvi,- , , c.:! (by which I mean today's lamentable, straight-party-line Supreme Court ruline ;that removes limits from direct corporate underwriting of political campaigns) -- there is one other event today that will have big ripple effects. i mean SecState Hillary Clinton's speech this morning about \Internet Freedom,\ mentioned ;:lere and with a prelude discussion I'm not going to take time for a thorough gloss of the speech. Instead I highly recommend reading the full text, lette, or watching the official video, .'tere. And for now some of the main points while listening (and noting main points down in real time with the handy ' uiveaSccibe, pen.) - In contrast to the dreamy Internet optimism of a decade or so ago -- I'm not naming names, but I remember! -- when many people imagined that info technology, by itself, would undermine oppression and bring the world together, Clinton started off with a very astringent reminder that this technology, like others, was neither good or bad in itself and is already being used in both helpful and destructive ways: \Amid this unprecedented surge in connectivity, we must also recognize that these technologies are not an unmitigated blessing. These tools are also being exploited to undermine human progress and political rights. Just as steel can be used to build hospitals or machine guns, or nuclear power can either energize a city or destroy it, modern information networks and the technologies they support can be harnessed for good or for ill. The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al-Qaida to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent. And technologies with the potential to open up access to government and promote transparency can also be hijacked by governments to crush dissent and deny human rights.\ And a very nice pivot out of this section, effective because it's so blunt and plain: \On their own, new technologies do not take sides in the struggle for freedom and progress, but the United States does.\ - Underscoring the \this is a big deal\ tone of the speech, she enumerated the \Four Freedoms\ that FDR proclaimed in 1941, as part of the struggle for the world's future, and said there were a comparable set of Four Freedoms for the Internet age. Check out the speech yourself for details. - The China surprise: the speech was a more frontal challenge to Chinese internet and overall censorship policy than I expected, and than I recall in other US-China interactions in a very long time. For instance, early in the speech, an itemization of the places where suppression is getting worse: \In the last year, weve seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information. China, Tunisia, and Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet. In Vietnam, access to popular social networking sites has suddenly disappeared. And last Friday in Egypt, 30 bloggers and activists were detained.\ Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Egypt -- this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government, in its recent sense of rise to superpower status, is used to being lumped with. Compared to the US as a financial power, OK; overtaking japan in economic size, yes; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations.., all that is one thing. Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different. Sentences like this dont appear in formal, big- deal SecState addresses by accident. Other passages to the same effect: \As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics.... \Those who disrupt the free flow of information in our society or any other pose a threat to our economy, our government, and our civil society. Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation....\ And then the Google section itself. I had wondered whether the speech would mention Google by name -- and had reason to think it might not. (Main argument forleavina it implicit rather than referring directly to the Google case: in the company's ongoing efforts to find a \il lvineyiftaiv_in\ acceptable way to remain in China, rather than a lose-lose-lose permanent split, its not necessarily a help to have the U.S. government standing officially by its side. ) But the way Sec. Clinton introduced the point was significant: as a proxy for China's own ability to H.to,tentiai and sustain its economic rise: \To use market terminology, a publicly listed company in Tunisia or Vietnam that operates in an environment of censorship will always trade at a discount relative to an identical firm in a free society. If corporate decision makers dont have access to global sources of news and information, investors will have less confidence in their decisions over the long term. Countries that censor news and information must recognize that from an economic standpoint, there is no distinction between censoring political speech and commercial speech. If businesses in your nations are denied access to either type of information, it will inevitably impact on growth. \Increasingly, U.S. companies are making the issue of internet and information freedom a greater consideration in their business decisions. I hope that their competitors and foreign governments will pay close attention to this trend. The most recent situation involving Google has attracted a great deal of interest. And we look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent. \The Internet has already been a source of tremendous progress in China, and it is fabulous. There are so many people in China now online. But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century. Now, the United States and China have different views on this issue, and we intend to address those differences candidly and consistently in the context of our positive, cooperative, and comprehensive relationship.\ Theres a lot more in the speech, including about terrorism, disaster relief, religion, etc -- but its there for the reading. Back to the to-do list for me now. Peirmalink .Share This

C05761689	By MATTHEW LEE WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will soon announce that gay American diplomats will be given benefits similar to those that their heterosexual counterparts enjoy, U.S. officials said Saturday. In a notice to be sent soon to State Department employees, Clinton says regulations that denied same-sex couples and their families the same rights and privileges that straight diplomats enjoyed are \unfair and must end,\ as they harm U.S. diplomacy. \Providing training, medical care and other benefits to domestic partners promote the cohesiveness, safety and effectiveness of our posts abroad,\ she says in the message, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. \It will also help the department attract and retain personnel in a competitive environment where domestic partner benefits and allowances are increasingly the norm for world-class employers,\ she says. \At bottom, the department will provide these benefits for both opposite-sex and same-sex domestic partners because it is the right thing to do,\ Clinton says. Among the benefits that will now be granted gay diplomats: the right of domestic partners to hold diplomatic passports, government-paid travel for their partners and families to and from foreign posts, and the use of U.S. medical facilities abroad. In addition, gay diplomats families will now be eligible for U.S. government emergency evacuations and training courses at the Foreign Service Institute, the message says. The announcement, expected this week, was provided to the AP by a State Department official who is a member of the Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies organization. Two department officials not affiliated with the organization confirmed its accuracy.

I think this has potential and Ill raise with SRAP, but wanted you to know -- in case it comes up in your meeting. When I met with a couple of the Afghan women who participated in the recent peace jirga, they told me that it would send a very strong message if a large group of women representing Afghan civil society could meet with you when you are in Kabul for the conference. I dont know if it will be possible to arrange such a large gathering, but perhaps something significant can be arranged. Melanne S.

C05769194	Team would like to release following statement. Okay by you? MEDIA NOTE Joint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National Elections Following is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Store, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan. Begin Text: National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudans twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the political process. We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation, harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri participation. Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan, and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and liabilities. We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.

C05777640	OPINION DECEMBER 7, 2010 New Start: Ratify, With Caveats The treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, but senators should make it clear to Moscow that they dont see it as limiting U.S. missile defenses. By CONDOLEEZZA RICE When U.S. President Bush and Russian President Putin signed the Moscow Treaty in 2002, they addressed the nuclear threat by reducing offensive weapons,-as their predecessors had. But the Moscow Treaty was different. It came in the wake of Americas 2001 withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, and for the first time the United States and Russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses. Breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked a key moment in the establishment of a new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the Cold War face-off between the Warsaw Pact and NATO. The real threat was that the worlds most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the worlds most dangerous regimes—or of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 9/11. And since those very rogue states also pursued ballistic missiles, defenses would (alongside offensive weapons) be integral to the security of the United States and our allies. It is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the New Start treaty to U.S. national security. The treaty is modest, reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1,550 on each side—more than enough for deterrence. While the treaty puts limits on launchers, U.S. military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain a triad of bombers, submarine-based delivery vehicles and land-based delivery vehicles. Moreover, the treaty helpfully reinstates on-site verification of Russian nuclear forces, which lapsed with the expiration of the original Start treaty last year. Meaningful verification was a significant achievement of Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and its reinstatement is crucial. Still, there are legitimate concerns about New Start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and, if the treaty is ratified, in future monitoring of the Obama administrations commitments. First, smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona has led a valiant effort in this regard. Thanks to his efforts, roughly $84 billion is being allocated to the Department of Energys nuclear weapons complex. Ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments, and Congress should fully fund the presidents program. Congress should also support the Defense Department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense strategy study coauthored by former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley. Second, the Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty, the U.S. is not re-establishing the Cold War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New Starts preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes the \interrelationship\ of the two. Administration officials have testified that there is no link, and that the treaty will not limit U.S. missile defenses. But Congress should ensure that future Defense Department budgets reflect this. Moscow contends that only current U.S. missile-defense plans are acceptable under the treaty. But the U.S. must remain fully free to explore and then deploy the best defenses—not just those imagined today. That includes pursuing both potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases. I have personally witnessed Moscows tendency to interpret every utterance as a binding commitment. The Russians need to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries. Russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our missile defenses. In addition, the welcome agreements on missile-defense cooperation reached in Lisbon recently between NATO and Russia can improve transparency and allow Moscow and Washington to work together in this field. After all, a North Korean or Iranian missile is not a threat only to the United States, but to international stability broadly. Ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as a way to buy Moscows cooperation on other issues. The men in the Kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terrorists—some who operate in Russias unstable south—are dangerous. That alone should give our governments a reason to work together beyond New Start and address the threat from tactical nuclear weapons, which are smaller and more dispersed, and therefore harder to monitor and control. Russia knows too that a nuclear Iran in the volatile Middle East or the further development of North Koreas arsenal is not in its interest. Russia lives in those neighborhoods. That helps explain Moscows toughening stance toward Tehran and its longstanding concern about Pyongyang. The issue before the Senate is the place of New Start in Americas future security. Nuclear weapons will be with us for a long time. After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferators—not on further reductions in the U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threat to each other or to international stability. A modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for U.S. nuclear security (and that of our allies) going forward. With the right commitments and understandings, ratification of the New Start treaty can contribute to this goal. If the Senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record of ratification, New Start deserves bipartisan support, whether in the lame-duck session or next year. Ms. Rice, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a senior fellow at Stanfords Hoover Institution, was U.S. national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 and U.S. secretary of state from 2005 to 2009.

C05771411	Marking a landmark moment for all Daily Herald Editorial Board Published: 8/26/2010 12:05 AM Today marks a watershed moment in our nations history. Know what it is? Any plans to celebrate the occasion? Ninety years ago this day, the United States secretary of state signed into law the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote. That significant moment in history securing that basic civil right for one of the two genders in existence came after a more than 70-year struggle that saw pioneering \radical\ women jailed and physically abused as they fought for justice. Ninety years ago today. Not all that long ago, really. We still have women among us who lived during a time when this basic but powerful activity was prohibited. Denied to their mothers and grandmothers, older sisters and aunts. Illinois played a pivotal role in the struggle, and Illinois and suburban women continue to mark our history, politics and policy. And they should continue to by exercising their right, speaking out and working to change policies that affect us all. Illinois did not allow women to vote in presidential and local elections until 1913 and, according to votingwomen.org, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin were the first three states to ratify the 19th Amendment on June 10, 1919. From the start, Illinois and its suburbs have been home to pioneering women. Libertyvilles Clara Colby is listed as the first woman to vote, having cast a ballot for a new town hall while, papers at the time reported, her husband stayed home to \scrub clothes in the laundry.\ There is Jane Addams, the Cedarville, III., native social worker and suffragist who founded Chicagos Hull House and was one of the first women to win a Nobel Peace Prize. And Illinois has elected 14 female members of Congress. The first was Chicago Republican Winnifred S. Huck, only the third woman elected to Congress, just two years after the 19th Amendment ratification. Huck was the first wife and mother elected to Congress. Republican Ruth Hanna McCormick worked as a Springfield lobbyist who helped pass the law allowing Illinois women to vote in some elections in 1913 before she moved on to Congress. Democrat Emily Taft Douglas, an early leader of the League of Women Voters and an internationalist who was the wife of former U.S. Sen. Paul Douglas and a cousin to President William H. Taft, beat isolationist Republican Stephen Day in 1945, according to the Women in Congress website. In more recent times, Rockford Republican Lynn Martin moved from Congress to Labor Secretary and Chicago Democrat Carol Moseley Braun became the first black woman in the U.S. Senate. Now, of course, we also have Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who hails from Park Ridge. In the suburban trenches all along the way, women have been leading and agitating for change. Former Democratic state Rep. Eugenia Chapman of Arlington Heights is credited with helping start community colleges in Illinois. Republican Giddy Dyer of Hinsdale joined her in supporting the Equal Rights Amendment and also passed DuPage Countys first clean air ordinance. Chapman worked with Republican Virginia B. Macdonald of Arlington Heights to establish a womens center at Harper College. And omit goes. Nice, you say, but big deal? Indeed, they were a big deal and, indeed, women shaping our lives still are a big deal. Men, can you imagine your life without women? Women, can you imagine your life without other women? American women have come a long way in 90 years and society is the better for it. Women vote in greater numbers than men and have for years, nationally and in Illinois. They very well can and should vote, write laws, lead and play even more influential roles in what the next 90 years, and beyond, may bring us all.

C05766340	Levin opposed the surge, but voted for funding the troops. Pasted below is Levins speech on troops in Afghanistan. Well have a copy for you as well. Afghan speech below FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 11, 2009 Contact: Senator Levins Office Phone: 202.224.6221 Senate Floor Speech - Surge the Afghan Army Remarks as prepared for delivery Today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight years ago this morning, our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists motivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day, the innocent lives lost, and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, the nation that hosted those terrorists, cannot again become a safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially appropriate occasion to take stock of those efforts, and consider how best to continue them. I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, where I was joined by my colleagues Senators Jack Reed and Ted Kaufman. The situation in Afghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the right steps, we can ensure that Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-friendly government that could once again provide a safe haven for al Qaeda to terrorize us and the world. The Obama administrations new strategy, focusing on securing the Afghan populations safety and partnering with the Afghan security forces in that effort, is an important start at reversing the situation in Afghanistan. The change in strategy has led our forces, in the words of General McChrystals Counterinsurgency Guidance, to \live, eat and train together [with the Afghan security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one another, and hold each other accountable....and treat them as equal partners in success.\ The Guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan security forces \is our goal.\ To achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the Afghan security forces in their efforts to become self-sufficient in delivering security to their nation — before we consider whether to increase U.S. combat forces above the levels already planned for the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the Afghan Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing more trainers for the Afghan Army and police than presently planned; providing them more equipment than presently planned; and working to separate local Taliban fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in Iraq. While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still have important advantages there. The Afghan people hate the Taliban. Public opinion polls show support for the Taliban at about 5%. In addition, the Afghan army is highly motivated and its troops are proven fighters. Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General McChrystal believes, and I agree, that we need to regain the initiative and create a momentum towards success. General McChrystal worries, and rightly so, about the perception that we have lost that initiative, and the impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government, al Qaeda and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that perception, we have a chance to convince local and lower- level Taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society. I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in Afghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that Afghanistans army and police have the manpower, equipment and support to secure their own nation. First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan army and police faster than currently planned. There are approximately 90,000 troops in the Afghan army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 by October of 2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of 82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have urged the establishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan police by 2013. The Afghan Minister of Defense has strongly supported those numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan government are prepared to accept those goals. But the need for additional Afghan forces is urgent. I believe it both possible and essential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012. Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for more Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand province we visited last week, our Marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by 5 to one. A Marine Company commander in Helmand province told the New York Times in July that a lack of Afghan troops \is absolutely our Achilles heel.\ What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan army and police? According to Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, there is no lack of Afghan manpower; weve been assured it is available. But we will need significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in charge of the American effort to train Afghan security forces, whether such an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment of what would be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In the meantime, we should also press our NATO allies with much greater forcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going to come through with the combat forces they have pledged, at least they could provide additional trainers. Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan officers. In addition to supporting efforts to graduate more Afghan officers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of Defense Minister Wardak that previous mid-level officers who fought the war against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis. Minister Wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated, and while they may not be trained in the most current tactics, they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group of officers is trained. A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such a barracks. While the available infrastructure may not be the most modern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts. Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. There must be a major effort to transfer a significant amount of the equipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan army and police. Such a significant commitment to equip the Afghan security forces would also help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and create momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of Iraq; our military is calling it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the worlds history. A significant part of it could be transferred to the Afghan forces, increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness. And yet there does not seem to be that kind of a crash effort in place to do that. We need to obtain on an urgent basis a list of the basic equipment needs of the Afghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major program to transfer equipment leaving Iraq. Rapidly expanding Afghanistans military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now face there. General McChrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force creates a gap in capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. But by accelerating the training and equipping of Afghan forces by a year, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from Afghan, rather than U.S., forces, also addresses a major problem of public perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint there, the more our enemies can seek to drive a wedge between us and the Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate a Muslim nation. Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local Taliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of young Iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the \Sons of Iraq.\ They were drawn in part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks, and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating horrific violence in their own communities. In their own interests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides and became a positive force. That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our military say that local Taliban fighters are motivated largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal. They believe an effort to attract these fighters to the governments side could succeed, if they are offered security for themselves and their families, and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us. General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such re-integration to accomplish the same result as was achieved in Iraq. Here is what General McChrystal said on July 28th: \Most of the fighters we see in Afghanistan are Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we dont see are deeply ideological or even politically motivated; most are operating for pay; some are under a commanders charismatic leadership; some are frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is significant potential to go after what I would call mid- and low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them re-integration into Afghanistan under the constitution.\ But this \game changing\ possibility was apparently not factored into General McChrystals assessment. There is no plan yet to put in place a Sons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to involve local and national Afghan leaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but first we and our Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent basis. And the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken into account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military resources. Afghanistans people are grateful for our aid, but also eager to assume responsibility for their future. In a tiny village in Helmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting, their shura. One hundred or so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their countrys future. When asked how long the United States should stay, one elder said: \Until the moment that you make our security forces self-sufficient. Then you will be welcome to visit us, not as soldiers but as guests.\ Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency in their security is everybodys goal. On that there is little difference of opinion, in Afghanistans village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol. Can we help Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we get there in a way that regains the initiative and creates the momentum we need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an insurgency headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they dont share? I believe we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan Army and police; by providing more trainers more quickly; by a rapid infusion to Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq; and by rapidly adopting a plan for the re-integration of lower level Taliban fighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan security forces. Our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of a mission that is clearly in our national security interest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the Taliban. I believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the previously planned and announced increase in U.S. combat forces, provides the best chance of success for our mission: preventing Afghanistan from again being run by a Taliban government which harbors and supports Al-Qaeda, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on the United States and the world. And we should implement these steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year.

C05739732	Contrast between Benghazi and reports from the West: Here in Benghazi since Thursday, I have joined our representative, Chris Stevens, in meetings with a large number of representatives from the TNC, civil society, UN organizations and NG0s, and the diplomatic corps. While we had no idea that our trip would correspond with significant military advances in the east and the start of the coordinated Tripoli uprising dubbed \Operation Mermaid Dawn,\ the timing gave us the opportunity to note the contrast between the relative bureaucratic quiet here compared to hyped-up activity in western Libya. Clearly, some coordination is underway between Benghazi and the west: Ali Tarhouni, recently promoted to Deputy Prime Minister In a still-to-be-completed cabinet reshufle, previewed the Tripoli uprising with us, down almost to the minute. Yet one feels that, to a large extent, TNC officials are observers and chroniclers rather than the authors of the unfolding developments to the west. (In a telling anecdote, just after confiding in us the plans for Tripoli about to unfold, Tarhouni turned off his ringing cell phone, to concentrate on talking to us in a leisurely manner.) What TNC officials told us to a large extent was sensible and mostly reassuring in its content -- and the TNC just issued a directive reiterating its policy to treat combatants according to the Geneva conventions and observe human rights -- but their comments fell mostly in the category of passive analysis rather than aggressive forward thinking. Washington has task forces in focused on Tripoli; Benghazi does not While theres a sense in the air that the final battles have begun, that palpable anticipation does not seem to have translated into the type of stepped-up bureaucratic activity that one would expect. After meeting with us for nearly two hours on Thursday, TNC Executive Committee chair (and PM equivalent) Mahmoud Jibril returned to Doha rather than head any kind of war room here. I was on the ground far longer than Jibril, giving another cameo appearance here. Tarhouni confided that there is no plan for when or how the TNC would relocate quickly to Tripoli, should Tripoli fall. TNC Chairman Mustafa Abduljalil (who remains by all accounts a unifying figure here) is a humble, retiring leader, which after Qadhafis flamboyance is part of the attraction for Libyans but which does not make him naturally think of how to project INC authority and symbolism quickly to the newly liberated areas. The question is when Tripoli falls, do the extensive plans that the TNC has made about the post Qadhafi transitional structures have any relevance for Tripoli? I do not want to overplay this: the flags being raised in the western towns are the flags used here. Our visit to the military command center demonstrated that there is active information flow (if not exactly command and control) passing between east and west. Tarhouni and others who visit western towns, usually from Tunis, describe support there and from tribal leaders across Libya. No other groups are claiming to have established or planned for an alternative civilian authority to compete with the TNC. Still, in our engagement with TNC officials, we will need to remind them continually of the imperative to nurture their legitimacy and authority and to prevent a political vacuum that others could fill -- especially after Tripoli falls and the INC is here, not there. Weve talked a lot about Tripoli and whether a battle for the capital could be avoided, which we argued would be the best solution. One of the TNCs assets is the moral distinction between what the Libya that the TNC aspires to promote and how Qadhafi has treated Libyas citizens. The worlds attention will focus on a battle for Tripoli, we cautioned, and acts of brutality and revenge and potential internal fights among competing militias will blur that moral distinction even more than the assassination of INC Chief of Staff Abdulfatah Younis already did. The damage to the TNCs credibility could be irreparable. We also noted that a TNC led negotiation that succeeds in winning Tripoli without a fight would underscore the TNC leadership far more dramatically than a successful militia assault only vaguely connected to the Benghazi leadership. The TNC officials heard us out patiently, but they clearly were not in the mood to negotiate. They feel confident about the current military situation, and they remain convinced that Qadhafi simply will not give up no matter how high the pressure. If anything, their positions have hardened in recent weeks, with Abduljalil telling us that the TNC will no longer contemplate Qadhafi staying in Libya once he is out of power. Saif Qadhafi is seen in the same category as his father. I do not believe that anything short of a significant change -- Qadhafis departure, a military U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739732 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

NO FOIA WAIVER. setback that punctures the TNCs current confidence, NATO insisting on a pause in operations in favor of negotiations -- will persuade the TNC leadership that it is in their interest right now to offer Qadhafi a peaceful way out. Tarhouni also acknowledged with his trademark candor that, to the Libyan people right now, negotiations would appear weak and not a satisfactory climax to the revolution. They do have a point that, despite signs of desperation around Qadhafi (e.g., Mohammed Ismails multiple attempts to contact Gene Cretz and me), there is no indication that Qadhafi himself is prepared to throw in the towel. There is real fear that, should Qadhafi somehow make it from Tripoli to Sebha, a guerilla war could persist for years, with supplies and mercernaries smuggled across the Saharan border. Among other topics, we pushed the INC officials hard on starting a high-profile discussion immediately on the reconciliation which is part of the TNCs platform. We noted that the many victims of Qadhafis 42-year rule will be less likely to pursue individual acts of revenge If they are assured that there will be some form to address grievances through rule-of-law accountability. The same message should also appeal to average Libyans who for whatever reason remained as part of Qadhafis regime to the end but who have no blood on their hands and might otherwise fear retribution. INC officials refer approvingly to the South African and Moroccan models, and they reiterated their commitment for an inclusive process for Libyas future that welcomes all but the most notorious individuals around Qadhafi. Yet they still seem to rely largely on (variously described) luck, tribal discipline, and the \gentle character\ of the Libyan people as the best assurances against abuse and revenge killings. We will continue to push on this. Benghazi remained full of chatter about the Abdulfatah Younis assassination. With tribal visits and investigation committees and cabinet changes, the INC addressed the immediate crisis sufficiently effectively that the intiial tension and gunfire quickly dissipated. But the assassination highlighted two realities of Libyan life that TNC officials had previously tried to downplay: tribes and militias. Rather than denying the tribal affiliations of Libyans, TNC officials are now looking to the tribes as part of the solution in enforcing discipline and preventing the type of widescale looting and pillaging that destroyed Benghazis security infrastructure in March. Tribes, we heard, can also be a corrective balance to Islamist leanings. On reining in the militias, we heard no good answers. Some people (Tarhouni, INC National Security Advisor Bazama, some civil society representatives) spoke frankly about the problem, including the Islamist leanings of the most powerful. The Islamist militias deserve more discussion in other channels, but a couple of people noted that the Younis assassination had an upside in making scrutiny of this issue imperative. Others seemed to rely, again, on luck or tried to avert their eyes from the problem that militias could post on the Day After. There was widespread disdain for Qatars role in encouraging certain militia elements, and I will be able to cite lots of concern here when I go to Doha later. Qatars role, too, is a subject better discussed elsewhere. We also discussed humanitarian and financial needs. Tarhouni and Jibril noted that the TNCs financial needs increase as more territory falls under rebel control; they are worried that, if they cant provide electricity to newly liberated towns or fund other services there, disenchantment with the TNC will grow. Tarhouni agreed to reach out to the Indians to discuss Libyas outstanding debts, to see if he can help us get Indias hold on the frozen asset proposal lifted. Briefed on South Africas objections, fibril understood the need for continued outreach to Africa (although part of our South Africa problem may derive from Jibrils poor relations with Zuma, with Jibril telling us that he recently accused Zuma of making Nelson Mandela feel ashamed); Abdulrahman Shalgam will go to the August 25-26 AU Summit and Jibril did not rule out attending himself. Ive spoken several times to UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed since arriving here, and the UAE has finally responded positively to our soft collateral proposal for a loan to the TNC, which may be our fastest way of getting funds here, assuming we can come up with a letter that meets the UAEs needs and passes the scrutiny of the U.S. interagency process. My traveling companions, Bill Roebuck (NEA/MAG director) and Ben Fishman from the NSS, start their return trip today. I will go on to Cairo, Doha, and Abu Dhabi, where, inter alia, I will have more Libya discussions, including seeing Jibril again in Doha. With NileSat continuing to broadcast Qadhafis propaganda, the Libyan anger over Egypts role approaches if not exceeds annoyance with Qataar. We are also checking on how to get from Cairo back here, should I need to join Chris here in the coming days. Chris and his tiny staff are doing a heroic job in representing our interests here. I am especially appreciative to DS for all the work done to support my trip. I also want to highlight the work that Pat Kennedys M family and NEA/EX did in establiishing living and working quarters for Chris and his team.

C05761775	FYI CQ TODAY ONLINE NEWS — APPROPRIATIONS June 4, 2009 — 1:39 p.m. War Supplemental Conference Slips to Next Week By Josh Rogin, CQ Staff House leadership has decided not to hold a conference or a vote on the war supplemental spending bill this week, as leaders worked behind the scenes to secure enough Democratic votes to pass the measure absent GOP support. Multiple lawmakers and aides confirmed the expected Thursday session to finalize negotiations over the bill (HR 2346), which is mainly to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, will not occur until at least early next week. Democratic leaders were trying to convince as many as 18 of the 51 Democrats who voted against the House version in May to change their votes, but many said they would not do so. Republicans are promising to vote against the conference report en mass if it includes $5 billion worth of funding related to the International Monetary Fund. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday it would. \I believe there are people in the Republican Party who support [the IMF funding]; they just don't want to support it on this bill,\ Pelosi said Thursday, \So we have to do that with all Democratic votes.\ She also pushed back against two key pillars of the House Republican leaderships argument against the IMF funding, which is meant to accommodate an increased U.S. credit extension to the organization. Responding to statements of Minority Leader John A. Boehner of Ohio that the IMF money is unrelated to the war spending measure, Pelosi said the IMF help was a \national security initiative\ because it helps to alleviate sources of instability, such as poverty. Pelosi also accused House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., of fear mongering by putting out a statement warning that IMF assistance could somehow fund terrorism. \I dont know why anyone would say that the money is going to the hands of terrorists,\ she said. \It simply is not based in fact and is a scare tactic, and most unfortunate.\ House Democratic aides said the conference on the supplemental bill probably would be early next week. \Were going to come up with a supplemental conference report in the next few days,\ said Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. 6 Whipping Votes House leaders had planned to hold the conference session Thursday and had said the House floor vote could be as early as Friday. But their effort to convince members to switch their no votes was still underway Thursday afternoon. • Although several high ranking Democrats have pledged to switch their no votes, including Reps. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and George Miller, D-Calif., many others have said they would not. \Its a conscience vote,\ said Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., who said he was inclined to not change his stance on the bill \I havent cracked yet,\ said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who along with other anti-war Democrats has pledged to be against any war funding that does not provide for the withdrawal of troops from southwest Asia. Still, many Democrats said that the leadership was lobbying them relatively intensely. More Details Emerge Meanwhile, more details of the near finalized supplemental conference report negotiations came out Thursday. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, said that the final bill will \in all likelihood\ include money for 5 C-130 transport planes and 8 C-17 cargo planes, none of which was requested by the administration or in the Senates bill. The House bill had sought 11 C-130s and the 8 C-17s. Overall, the defense portion of the bill is expected to be about $4 billion less than the House version but still billions above the Senate version and the administration request, House Appropriations Defense subcommittee chairman John P. Murtha, D-Pa., said. As for the fate of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the conference report likely will include language barring the administration from transferring prisoners to U.S. soil for the remainder of the fiscal year, said House Appropriator James P. Moran, D-Va. No money towards the presidents effort to close the prisons will be in the conference report, Moran added. The president had requested $80 million but neither the House nor Senate versions included those funds.

C05739882	Another report-- SOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services. 1. As of the morning of July 6, an individual with access to the information stated in confidence that Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) President Mustafa Abdel Jalil remains committed to a transfer of power to a popularly elected government; however, he is prepared to ex-tend the life of the NTC as a guarantor of stability for the Libyan people following the July 7, 2012 election for seats in a 200-member General National Congress (GNC). Jaifi realizes that 2.7 million Libyans have registered to vote and are generally anxious to replace the increasingly unpopular NTC. That said, JAI expects the voting to lead to a period of confusion and he will not abandon his authority until the results are fixed. 2. Jalil is also frustrated by the fact that during its eight-month tenure of the administration of Prime Minister Abclel Rahman el-Keib - who was appointed by the NTC was unable to provide solutions for Libyas long list of needs: a functioning justice system, a reconciliation process for officials who served the old administration, the disarming of militia, building functional national security forces, rebuilding destroyed areas, and delivering basic services such as healthcare. 3. At the same time, outside of the oil sector, much of Libyas economy is stagnant, and in the opinion of Western security officials, lacks the governments go-ahead to restart public sector infrastructure contracts. In addition, international advisers and foreign investors are reluctant to return to an environment where the government will not sign long term agreements and cannot guarantee security. 4.(Source Comment: According to an extremely sensitive source, Jalil continues to believe that this chaotic situation should not be surprising. He regularly points out that eight months is not a sufficient amount of time to build functioning institutions from the remnants of the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi. The old regime featured a dysfunctional bureaucracy, idiosyncratic rule, and anti-institutionalism. Additionally, Jaill now re Ializes that due to pronounced incompetence and a lack of will to take unpopular decisions the el-Keib government also failed to make progress in the few areas where it could have achieved meaningful change. The towns of Sirte and Tawargha are representative of the situation in the countryside where people lost their homes in the conflict and have been living in temporary camps with limited ability to register and vote in their home district. Jalil has been urged by contacts in the French and Italian Governments to guarantee the rights of people across the country in particular, he has serious concerns as to whether or not supporters of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi in his hometown of Sirte will be included in the future political processes of the new Libya; if they are not allowed to vote by local militiamen. At the same time, the fighting between Libyan Arabs and Tebta tribesmen in the Kufra area threatens to prevent any voting there. Jalil has been warned that the NTC regulations now state that members of the National Army are not allowed to vote or run for office, which is a disincentive for armed militia brigade members to become legitimate soldiers.) 5.This well informed individual believes that despite these flaws, the new government created by the July 7 election will eventually have the mandate to take the difficult decisions that can create a reconciliation process. Jalil will work to maintain order in this transition period, and finally reach his goal of creating a situation where the government can rebuild homes and restore sufficient law and order; allowing those in Sirte, Tawargha, Kufra, and throughout the rest of the country to live in their hometowns, establishing a situation where a true civil society can develop.

Jail!, in conversations with the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), and separately with liberal leader Ali Tarhouni, has acknowledged that the central governments top priority must be security and that the NTC has been unable to provide it. That said, Jail! and Minister of Defense Ousarna alefuwali have pledged to provide 30,000 to 40,000 security personnel for election day to prevent similar incidents to the July 1 attack on Benghazis election headquarters. In that case eastern federalists entered the building, where ballot papers were burned and ballot boxes destroyed. Similarly, these federalist forces are suspected of the attack on July 5 that burned down Ajdabiyas main storage centre for election materials. 7. In the opinion of this individual, although those responsible for the Benghazi attack were pro-federalist, it has not been proven that they were members of the self-appointed Cyrenaican National Council (MC), whose military arm set up a roadblock in Wadi al-Ahmar on Libyas major east-west highway to demand that Cyrenaica get as many seats in the GNC as Tripolitania. Thus far, neither the CNC nor any other group has publicly stated that they intend to use violence to disrupt the elections. (Note: Under the current system Tripolitania will have 120 seats in the GNC, Cyrenaica (Barge) 62, and Fezzan in the South 18.)

C05769591	SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT ON THE RECENT INCIDENT IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza. The Council, in this context, condemns those acts which resulted in the loss of at least ten civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their families. The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships as well as the civilians held by Israel. The Council urges Israel to permit full consular access, to allow the countries concerned to retrieve their deceased and wounded immediately, and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance from the convoy to its destination. The Security Council takes note of the statement of the UN Secretary—General on the need to have a full investigation into the matter and it calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. The Security Council stresses that the situation in Gaza is not sustainable. The Council re-emphasizes the importance of the full implementation of Resolutions 1850 and 1860. In that context, it reiterates its grave concern at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and stresses the need for sustained and regular flow of goods and people to Gaza as well as unimpeded provision and distribution of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. The Security Council underscores that the only viable solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement negotiated between the parties and re-emphasizes that only a two-State solution, with an independent and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours, could bring peace to the region. The Security Council expresses support for the proximity talks and voices concern that this incident took place while the proximity talks are underway and urges the parties to act with restraint, avoiding any unilateral and provocative actions, and all international partners to promote an atmosphere of cooperation between the parties and throughout the region.

C05771372	Given your recognition of the importance of procurement reform, I thought you might like to see that USAID is getting credit for making changes already. This is both the right thing to do and getting good press where it counts. AM Dear Friends and Colleagues: What if we told you a little-known bureaucratic process called \Implementation and Procurement Reform,\ IPR for short, was one of the biggest victories for poor people in years? It means more aid can go directly through a country's own systems, making them stronger. It also means that more aid will be administered by local organizations who know best what their own communities need. Through IPR, USAID is putting President Obama's recent global development policy into action. The agency has set clear targets to increase use of local country systems and organizations, which means that US assistance will help citizens and their governments build their own capacity, instead of setting up a parallel system as they've done in recent years. They've set clear and ambitious targets for themselves that are laser-focused on results, and dedicated to fighting global poverty not just in the short term, but for good. Photo: Local organizations distribute assistance after performing a needs assessment in Bihar, India. Ian Bray/OXFAM GB This reform will likely be criticized by some who think that putting more money in the hands of local actors will expose USAID's programs to more risk. But this is precisely the point; only by supporting local change agents—both inside and outside developing country governments—can we actually strengthen the hands of people in poor countries who are working to change their own societies for the better. That means managing risk wisely, rather than trying to avoid it altogether. And in our field research, 36 of the 39 activists we interviewed said they want USAID to support their government's directly, because it would make it easier for them to hold their governments accountable and prevent corruption. What does all this mean? It means better aid, aid that strengthens the capacity of reformers in poor countries. And for the millions of people across the world who have been demanding these reforms, USAID has shown it is actively listening. Sincerely, The Aid Effectiveness Team p.s.

C05768305	sbwhoeop Tuesday, April 13, 2010 6:35 PM H: If this poll holds, Labour has a majority. 1st debate thu. Sid • Print this page From Times Online April 14, 2010 Tory lead narrows amid huge voter disenchantment, Times poll finds olmage :1 of 20, Peter Riddell The general election race is tightening, according to a Populus poll for The Times that reveals deep public disenchantment with the campaign so far. The poll, undertaken yesterday and this morning, says that more voters are now hoping for a hung parliament than either a Tory or a Labour outright victory. Conservative support has slipped by three points over the past week to 36 per cent, while Labour is a point up at 33 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 21 per cent. The polls tend to fluctuate by a couple of points either way. and these shifts are within the margin of error of the average. With other new polls pointing to a firming in Labour support, the party may have enjoyed a small boost from its manifesto launch. Tory strategists will hope to have achieved a boost from its manifesto launch today. If the Populus figures were repeated in the general election in three weeks' time, and there is a uniform switch in votes, Labour would be the largest single party, with about 300 MPs, ahead of the Tories on 264 and the Lib Dems on 54. This would point to a Lab/Lib Dem coalition. But many analysts do not expect a uniform national swing. The latest poll shows that 32 per cent of the public now hope for a hung parliament (as opposed to expecting one), against 28 per cent wanting a Tory majority and 22 per cent a Labour one. Lib Dem voters prefer a deal with Labour than the Tories in a hung parliament, by 44 to 31 per cent. The public is evenly split 40 to 42 per cent about whether they want Labour or the Tories in either a majority or a minority government. The poll shows that the number expecting a Tory overall majority has risen by three points to 34 per cent over the past week. This only just exceeds the number expecting a hung parliament, at 33 per cent, down six points compared with a week ago. Overall, 57 per cent expect the Tories to be the largest party, against 29 per cent expecting Labour to be. The public is deeply sceptical about the honesty of the parties. Only 4 per cent think that they are being completely honest about their tax plans, 61 per cent partly honest. Only 6 per cent say they are being completely honest about cutting the deficit and 61 per cent partly honest. Some 7 per cent say that they are being completely honest about the extent to which they can fund their policies by cutting waste and 58 per cent partly honest. Voters were asked to say which party had proposed eight key manifesto pledges. They wrongly identified four: reducing the increase in national insurance contributions (naming Labour not the Tories); allowing unsuccessful schools, hospitals and the police (the Tories, not Labour); tightening up takeover rules (the Tories not Labour); and requiring foreign workers employed in public services to speak fluent English (the Tories not Labour). In only one case, the £150-a-year tax break, did more than half of voters (60 per cent) correctly identify the party making the proposal. In most cases, the pledge will make little difference to people's votes, apart from three made by Labour: the foreign workers language pledge, doubling paid paternity leave and allowing the takover of unsuccessful schools, hospitals etc. More than two fifths (43 per cent), including 50 per cent of women, say \none of the parties\, or \dont know\, when asked which party is putting across a convincing cases to voters. This compares with 25 per cent naming the Tories and 18 per cent Labour. Just over half the public (54 per cent) plan to watch the first televised leaders debate on Thursday evening. Men and middle class professionals are more likely to say that they will view. More than two fifths (42 per cent) expect David Cameron to win the debate, against 22 per cent for Gordon Brown. More Tories (70 per cent) than Labour voters ( 57 per cent) expect their leader to win. Two fifths of the public (42 per cent, up one point on a week ago) say it seems like a change from Labour, but are not sure that it is time for a change to the Conservatives. Some 33 per cent, down one point, think it is time for a change to the Tories. Populus interviewed a random sample of 1,525 adult voters on April 12 to 13. Interviews were conducted across the country and have been weighted to be representative of all adults. For more details go to www.populus.co.uk.

C05768612	Hillary and Cheryl, Im feeling very good about our recent efforts to connect our speeches thematically. Weve done it with development, human rights, and Internet freedom; and most recently with AIPAC, Ctr for Middle East Peace, and next the AJC. Heres what I want to suggest: The three most basic elements of human existence are food, water, and health. We have now done major speeches on food and water. Id like us to consider a major speech on global health — the third in a trilogy. Linking these three issues thematically, we can explain how and why foreign policy challenges and solutions must be seen through a prism of human survival and why the conditions of peoples lives influence everything from economic development to political stability and more. This trilogy of speeches (with the right PR) could further underscore our elevation of development AND our comprehensive, smart power approach to foreign policy. After all, food, water, and health are the sine qua non of human progress. And this is a Hillary Clinton signature idea, at least to me. Thoughts? LM

C05769099	This is what we propose to put out, with Rs putting out similar: Today, Secretary Clinton spoke by telephone with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov. They discussed preparations for the upcoming June 24 summit between President Obama and President Medvedev. Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov reveiwed developments in Kyrgyzstan and stressed their shared concern over the recent violence and continuing interethnic tensions. The ministers agreed that the issue of the upcoming referendum us the sovereign decision of Kyrgyzstan to make and agreed to encourage the authorities of Kyrgyzstan to conduct it according to international standards with the monitoring support of OSCE and others. The ministers also discussed coordination of U.S. and Russian humanitarian assistance and other support to Kyrgyzstan to help its authorities restore security, stability, and reconciliation among all citizens of Kyrgyzstan.
C05769101	Russian MFA plans to release a parallel press statement shortly and is faxing us the text.
C05769116	Below is the final text of the Quartet statement, which Lavrov, Ban, and Ashton have now agreed to release *without a call.* Sounds like your discussion with Lavrov did the trick: The Quartet re-affirms that the current situation in Gaza, including the humanitarian and human rights situation of the civilian population, is unsustainable, unacceptable, and not in the interests of any of those concerned. The Quartet reiterates its call for a solution that addresses Israels legitimate security concerns, including an end to weapons smuggling into Gaza; promotes Palestinian unity based on the Palestine Liberation Organization commitments and the reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the legitimate Palestinian Authority; and ensures the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza, consistent with United Nations Security Council resolution 1860 (2009). The Quartet declares its readiness to work closely with Israel, the Palestinian Government and international donors in order to achieve sustainable economic development on the basis of the full implementation of the Agreement on Access and Movement of 2005 and in the broader perspective of the two-state solution. Consistent with these objectives, the Quartet and the Quartet Representative have worked with Israel, as well as consulting the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and other concerned parties, to effect a fundamental change in policy in Gaza. The new policy towards Gaza just announced by the Government of Israel is a welcome development. The Quartet notes that the elaboration of further details and modalities of implementation will be important in ensuring the effectiveness of the new policy. Full and effective implementation will comprise a significant shift in strategy towards meeting the needs of Gazas population for humanitarian and commercial goods, civilian reconstruction and infrastructure, and legitimate economic activity as well as the security needs of Israel. The Quartet will continue to work with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and other concerned parties to ensure these arrangements are implemented as quickly as possible. The Quartet affirms that much work remains to achieve fully the solution stated above, and, in consultation with the concerned parties, it will monitor closely the implementation of the policy in all its aspects. It will actively explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, encourage involvement of the PA at the crossings and promote greater commerce between the West Bank and Gaza. The Quartet stresses the importance of United Nations and other international interventions, as well as the work of local non-governmental organizations, to be expanded in Gaza to meet urgent civilian needs, and calls on all parties to fully enable this work. The Quartet recognizes that Israel has legitimate security concerns that must continue to be safeguarded, and believes efforts to maintain security while enabling movement and access for Palestinian people and goods are critical. The Quartet commits to work with Israel and the international community to prevent the illicit trafficking of arms and ammunition into Gaza. It urges all those wishing to deliver goods to do so through established channels so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via land crossings into Gaza. The Quartet emphasizes that there is no need for unnecessary confrontations and calls on all parties to act responsibly in meeting the needs of the people of Gaza. The Quartet also calls for an end to the deplorable detention of Gilad Shalit in advance of the fourth anniversary of his capture on June 25; it further condemns the violation of Hamas international obligation to provide him access by the International Committee of the Red Cross and demands that Hamas immediately remedy the situation. The Quartet also reiterates its support for proximity talks toward the resumption, without pre-conditions, of direct bilateral negotiations that resolve all final status issues as previously agreed by the parties. The Quartet believes these negotiations should lead to a settlement, negotiated between the parties within 24 months, that ends the occupation which began in 1967 and results in the emergence of an independent, democratic, and viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.

You probably have already had all the thoughts below, but I wanted to put mine in writing. First, and most important, thanks for what you have done thus far, which has been remarkable. One week in, we have reacted most admirably to the Haiti crisis. State and AID are firmly in the lead; you, Cheryl, Raj, and Jake have done a heroic job; and the most urgent humanitarian challenges seem in hand. Although I have not participated in many of the departmental conversations about Haiti, based on my years thinking about that country. I wanted to offer suggestions that might prove helpful on the next round of interrelated challenges: , — Best, Harold Harold Hon61.1 Koh

C05769659	Background on the Women Deliver Conference CONTEXT The second Women Deliver conference will take place in Washington, DC on June 7-9, 2010. This conference is an international gathering that focuses on maternal health and will include an estimated 3,000 representatives from governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, and the private sector. The aim of the conference is to generate political commitment and financial investment for fulfilling Millennium Development Goal 5, which pledges a three-quarter reduction in maternal mortality and universal access to reproductive health by 2015. The conference is one of several international gatherings this year that will include a focus on maternal and child health (MCH). As you know, this issue will also feature at the G-8, where the Canadians are offering a flagship initiative on MCH, and at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September, where the UN Secretary General is sponsoring a Joint Effort on Women and Children's Health. The US will be represented at the Women Deliver conference by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, Undersecretary of State Maria Otero, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, and a host of other USG participants. Please note: You recently recorded a video message that will open the conference. The full script is below. SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS • For too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. • The United States has elevated the issue of maternal health in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a $63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems and integrated service delivery, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. This conference—along with other international gatherings this year, including the G-8 and the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September—presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health. • When women prosper, their families and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND The theme of this year's Women Deliver conference is \Delivering Solutions for Girls and Women,\ with a focus on political, economic, social/cultural, and technological solutions. Conference organizers plan to emphasize the following messages:1) The Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved without investing in women.2) There is just enough time, if the world commits funding now, to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5— an additional US $10 billion annually by 2010 and US $20 billion by 2015.Women Deliver was launched at a conference in London in 2007. Jill Sheffield is the President of the organization. FINAL VIDEO SCRIPT WOMEN DELIVER CONFERENCEWASHINGTON, DC I am delighted to welcome all of you to this conference and to thank you for the work you are doing to put maternal health at the top of our development agenda. Your commitment to this issue has raised awareness and inspired action around the world. We know that women represent our greatest opportunity for progress in this century. If the potential of women is fully developed, everyone benefits. And this can't be done without improving maternal health. But for too long and in too many places, women have received inadequate care when they give birth. As a result, childbirth remains a leading cause of death and injury to women worldwide. The United States has elevated this issue in our development work through the Global Health Initiative, a 63 billion dollar proposal to help countries improve health outcomes through strengthened health systems, with a particular focus on the health of women, newborns and children. We commend the Canadian government for focusing much-needed attention to this issue by offering a flagship initiative on maternal and child health at the upcoming G-8 meeting in Muskoka. The US also congratulates the United Nations Secretary General for convening governments, civil society, multilateral organizations, foundations and corporations to engage in a much-needed global effort to promote women's and children's health. These efforts—and this conference— present a unique opportunity to reinvigorate our commitment to maternal health, because when women prosper, their families and communities prosper. Women deliver for the world – now the world needs to deliver for them. Thank you.

C05768729	FYI http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/10/lugar no more money for development banks until reform Lugar: No more money for development banks until reform Posted By Josh Rogin Wednesday, March 10, 2010 In the wake of the global financial crisis, a slew of multinational development banks are asking for large amounts of new capital to both replenish and in some cases expand their resource pools, and much of the burden will fall on the United States. This creates a unique opportunity for the Obama administration to press these organizations to implement long-awaited reforms, according to the Senate's top Republican on foreign relations, who has a big say in whether and how the Congress doles out the funds. \As the world struggles to emerge from the worst economic crisis since World War II, it is an appropriate time to ask whether the [International Financial Institutions] are performing optimally and doing the jobs they should be doing,\ reads a newly released report by the staff of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-IN, \The crisis should not be used as an excuse to win increases that could not otherwise be justified. As the requests for capital are negotiated with the international donor community, there is a window of opportunity for significant reform.\ The report, which is the culmination of six years of research, including half a dozen hearings when Lugar was committee chairman, outlines several dozen recommendations for what the Obama administration, Congress, and the banks can do to update their relevance. \Does the world really need the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Inter-American Development Bank today? Can they be changed to better address our needs? How should we re-design them?\ the report asks. \Such questions are particularly timely because nearly all the IFIs have sought, or will soon seek, major new infusions of money from their donors, including the taxpayers of the United States.\ The Asian Development Bank has already asked the Obama administration for new funds, and the administration has requested in its new budget $533 million in direct money and $12.8 billion in borrowing authority for the ADB. A committee staffer told The Cable that Lugar wants to see progress on reform before he would support authorizing the money. \We want to make sure that before the American taxpayer puts more money in there that things are fixed,\ the staffer said. \Its not possible for them to do everything, but they could certainly make progress.\ The reforms the administration could press for in the short term include pressing the banks to focus more on development goals rather than the structure and size of loans and \work with the other donor countries to step back and slow down the process,\ the staffer said. Congress is also concerned that the Obama administration might not be interested in pressing for these reforms, considering that Obama issued a signing statement in June indicating he did not feel bound to follow congressional direction on such international negotiations. Negotiations between several banks and the Treasury Department are ongoing. The U.S. side is led by Scott Morris, deputy assistant secretary of the Treasurys Office of International Development Finance and Debt. The issue will next surface at the end of March when the Inter-American Development Bank convenes its annual meeting in Cancun. Michael H. Fuchs U.S. Department of State (202) 647-1709

C05762707	Your request is being processed... http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-clemons/can-national-security-adv b 214672.html Steve Clemons Director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation Posted: June 12, 2009 07:12 AM Can National Security Adviser James Jones Survive a Second Round of Attacks and \Longer Knives\? I am here in London where Im participating in an interesting forum sponsored by the Princeton Project on National Security and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Transatlantic Program, Ive received not just one email -- but three -- from prominent insider journalists and policy hands that Jim Jones tenure as National Security Adviser is highly fragile. One of these emails reports starkly: Knives getting longer Thats all my contact said. But other emails have intimated to me a serious tone-deafness by Jones about his role and responsibilities, his relationship with the President, and his relationship with younger, dedicated, hardworking and late-working staff. Jones recently said that National Security Council staff members that stayed longer than 7:30 pm must be disorganized in their work. I speak to various NSC officials -- often at 10:00 or 11:00 pm at night. They are hardworking, racing as fast as they can to manage the many, many, many major initiatives that Barack Obama has decided to simultaneously pursue. James Jones is considered by his admirers to be a genius when thinking about management structures and decision-making processes. On the other hand, his critics see him as a plodding, slow-moving, out of touch retired general who was better prepared to think about the last era rather than the one we are moving into. His °critics think that hes just too unable to animate nimble, high flex policy decision making products for a White House on a manic dash to get a lot of top tier issues dealt with. Friends at the National Security Council respect a great deal the way in which NSC Deputy Tom Donilon is managing his brief Many see him picking up the load that Jones seems unable or unwilling to carry. Donilon is deeply engaged in the broad Middle East and Iran portfolio, the non-proliferation/WMD/arms control portfolio, the China economic and security portfolio, and he has -- according to reports -- supported and helped cultivate relationship building between State, DoD, the NSC, and other parts of the national security bureaucracy. Some tell me that James Jones decided to try and remove himself from the \whack-a-mole\ crisis reaction style of decision-making that could rob the Obama administration of the chance to define a new course in national security affairs. Tom Donilon, according to reports, wields far more the hand of power when it comes to day to day management and responding to crises that require presidential attention and response. Jones, in contrast, has been obsessed with the structure of decisions -- who is involved in those decisions, what the structure of decision-making should be, and what legal modifications to this process need to be made. He looks at that as the big nut that needs to be cracked -- and that would improve, according to Jim Jones, the Presidents effectiveness and chances of success at a macro level. Jones self-determined task is not high profile, mostly structural, and has not won him many admirers for leadership -- but what he is doing is necessary. If he departs his role, this challenge of dealing with the growing complexity of national security threats and the vital need to recalibrate the policy making and decision-making process will require the attention of someone serious. So, whether Jones stays or goes -- his portfolio will remain vital. But what is clear is that Jones has enemies and that they are trying to undermine his place in the Obama orbit. Their motives may not be earnest concern about the tempo or pace of Jones management style -- but they very well could be his unwillingness to allow the liberal interventionists inside the Obama administration to have more than their fair share of power in the Obama decision-making process. Jones has structured an all views on the table approach to decision making -- quite evident when it comes to Middle East policy -- and the hawkish/neocon-friendly/Likudist-hugging part of the Obama administrations foreign policy operation may be engaged in a coup attempt against Jones. I dont know if hell survive this latest effort to oust him -- but folks need to know that those \longer knives\, on the whole, do not have pure motives. -- Steve Clemons directs the foreign policy programs at the New America Foundation and publishes the popular political blog, The Washington Note Shop Dells full line of Laptops now starting at $349!
C05761784	Here is the situation as I understand it. The film festival returned funds that it had received from the Israeli Embassy, after protests from some UK film figures (Ken Loach) and Palestinian solidarity groups. The Israeli director is now being funded directly by the festival. The organizers issued a sort of apology today. We have not been able to locate any State Dept response to similar episodes in the past (Israeli academics disinvited to a British conference).

C05761349	April 25, 2009 Clinton, in Iraq, Blames Rejectionists for Violence By MARK LANDLER BAGHDAD — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived here Saturday morning for a one-day visit, delivering an American show of support for Iraq as it battles a sudden eruption of violence, in the wake of suicide bombings that killed at least 140 people and wounded several hundred more on Thursday and Friday. Mrs. Clinton, in her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, acknowledged that the attacks were worrisome. She said she would seek a briefing on the security situation from the American military commander, Gen. Ray Odierno, in her first meeting on Saturday, a day packed with appointments. But she played down suggestions that the attacks augured a return to the relentless sectarian violence that convulsed Iraq in 2006. She said they did not signal that a new jihadist movement was taking root in Iraq, which could derail the progress the country has made in the last two years. \In Iraq, there will always be political conflicts,\ Mrs. Clinton said to reporters before setting off on the unannounced visit Friday evening. \But I really believe that Iraq, as a whole, is on the right track.\ She characterized the latest bout of violence as the last gasp of \rejectionists\ who fear that the government will succeed in creating a united and peaceful Iraq. The suicide bombings, she said, are \in an unfortunately tragic way, a signal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.\ \Are there going to be bad days? Yes, there are,\ Mrs. Clinton said. But she added, \If you look at the evidence, overwhelmingly the progress thats been made has been positive.\ The Obama administration, she said, was determined to help Iraq achieve \stability, sovereignty, and self-reliance,\ as the United States prepares to pull out the last of its troops by the end of 2011. Mrs. Clinton has been a regular visitor here, coming three times as a senator to chart the progress of a war she voted to authorize, but later said had been mismanaged by the Bush administration. She said she was pleased to be back, though the attacks have cast a shadow over her visit. While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist and jihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the withdrawal of American troops between now and 2011. Mrs. Clinton compared these latest suicide bombings to a spectacular terrorist attack that occurred several months after the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland. At times, her analysis almost echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. When the sectarian violence was relentless several years ago, Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its \last throes,\ while Mr. Rumsfeld talked of \dead-enders\ who kept fighting a lost cause. On Friday, Gen. David Petraeus, the head of the military's Central Command, testified before a House appropriations committee that the suicide bombers may have been part of a militant network based in Tunisia. Four of the bombers, he said, were from Tunisia. Mrs. Clinton said she did not have specific information on the bombers, but said: \Weve seen suicide bombers from many countries in Iraq over the last six years. Its unfortunate that young men, and occasionally even a young woman, would travel to Iraq to kill other people in that way.\ 41 The violence did not seem to curtail Mrs. Clinton's ambitions for her brief visit. In addition to General Odierno, she was scheduled to meet a retinue of Iraqi leaders, including the president, Jalal Talabani; the prime minister, Nuni Kamal al- Maliki; and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari. She is also playing host at a roundtable of Iraqi women, something she has done in previous trips to Iraq. And she is to hold a town-hall meeting with Iraqi students, as well as members of nongovernmental organizations and provincial reconstruction teams. This is a format Mrs. Clinton savored as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South Korea to Turkey. \I want to listen,\ she said, \I want to respond to their questions and concerns. I want some feedback and ideas of about how are we going to make this transition as successful as possible.\ When President Obama visited Baghdad earlier this month, dusty skies prevented him from traveling by helicopter from Baghdad International Airport into the city. He met with Mr. Maliki at a palace near the airport and General Odierno at the American base, Camp Victory. The new American ambassador, Christopher R. Hill, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. He was confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday after a lengthy process that was held up by Republican senators, who objected to his lack of experience in the Arab world and his handling of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program. In Iraq, Mr. Hill will spearhead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Some Iraq experts said the American civilian presence here had been lacking momentum since the departure in February of the last United States ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker.

C05764109	Crowley, Philip J <CrowleyPJ@state.gov> RELEASE IN PART B6 Here is what we have come up with as agreed language from Bob, Eric, Mike, Melanne, Lissa and me. This can be used for the letter and for press guidance. Melanne will send a letter to the GOSL and perhaps the UN Permrep. We will ask the Post to release the letter to journalists in Colombo once it is received. I will schedule a press briefing at the Foreign Press Center early this week, which will attract a good number of Asian journalists, and make sure the question is asked so we can put it in proper context. We will have it for guidance in the Main State briefing if asked. PJ BEGIN TEXT Questions have been raised regarding remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on September 30 before the United Nations Security Council on the adoption of a resolution to combat sexual violence in armed conflict. In her statement, she said that we have seen rape used as a tactic before in a number of countries, including Sri Lanka. Regarding the Secretary's reference to Sri Lanka in her address, we want to be clear. Over the course of the difficult conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), stretching into this decade, the State Department as well as credible human rights organizations reported numerous cases of rape and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government. This was the basis for the Secretary's statement. At the same time, in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009, though we remained deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and mistreatment of detainees, we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict areas around the world. We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context. These questions should not detract from the specific actions that Sri Lanka needs to take now. With the end of the military conflict, Secretary Clinton believes strongly that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the protection of human rights. The government of Sri Lanka should release more than 250,000 displaced persons who are still confined in camps, and lead a process of genuine political and social reconciliation. The United States stands ready to assist and support the people of Sri Lanka with these critical challenges.

Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, on Secretary General Ban's Panel Concerning the May 31 Flotilla Incident The United States welcomes today's announcement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the establishment of a Panel regarding the incident of May 31st- We thank both governments for the constructive and cooperative spirit they have shown and the Secretary General for his leadership and determination. The Panel, which has the support of both Israel and Turkey, will receive and review the reports of each government's national investigation into the incident and make recommendations as to how to avoid such incidents in the future. This Panel is not a substitute for those national investigations. It complements them, affording Israel and Turkey the opportunity to present the conclusions of their investigations to the international community. The focus of the Panel is appropriately on the future and on preventing such incidents from recurring. The United States also hopes that the Panel can serve as a vehicle to enable Israel and Turkey to move beyond the recent strains in their relationship and repair their strong historic ties. The United States expects that the Panel will operate in a transparent and credible manner and that its work will be the primary method for the international community to review the incident, obviating the need for any overlapping international inquiries. The United States welcomes the naming of the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Geoffrey Palmer, as Chair and the outgoing President of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe, as Vice-Chair. We look forward to the announcement of the two additional members from Israel and Turkey. ### This email is UNCLASSIFIED. This email is UNCLASSIFIED.

C05763834	I can set this up thru ops if u want to call. The Secretary's Call Sheet for Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari Purpose of Call: To express your condolences regarding the deaths of Iraqi MFA personnel in the August 19 attack on the Iraqi Foreign Ministry. MI want to personally express my heartfelt condolences to you for the savage attack on the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and for the tragic loss of so many Iraqi lives around Baghdad and particularly at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. al I remember fondly our meeting at the MFA in April — I was proud to be the first senior U.S. official to attend a meeting there, and I was deeply saddened to hear that your Ministry was attacked. DI This is a trying day for Iraqis and the Government of Iraq, but brutal attacks like these only deepen the need for dedicated Iraqi like you and those in your Ministry, to remain committed to the new Iraq. 1:11 Know that the United States will continue to stand by Iraq as it faces these challenges. Background: On Wednesday, August 19, what appears to be a series of VBIED and additional rocket attacks in Baghdad resulted in the bloodiest day in Baghdad since the June 30 withdrawal of U.S. forces from urban areas. Although exact numbers have not been confirmed, media is reporting that approximately 75 people were killed across Baghdad with over 100 injuries. The most devastating attack appears to have been against the Iraqi MFA, where a VBIED was exploded in front of the main gate. Zebari's Chief of Staff estimated that there were 35-40 fatalities and up to 40 injuries resulting from this attack, with 70% of the building damaged. In April, you were the first senior U.S. official to hold a meeting at the MFA. Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abbawi, who attended your meeting at the MFA and who's wife led your meeting with Iraqi war widows, was reportedly slightly injured and quite shaken by the attack. He may have lost a number of staff members. At this point, we do not know if other senior-ranking MFA officials were killed or wounded in the attack.

The Australian - 19 Jun 10 Embracing everyone from the US to India Greg Sheridan, Foreign editor GEORGE Yeo, Singapore's Foreign Minister, is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in Southeast Asia. Singapore is a society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook. But Yeo combines Singapore's characteristic hard-headedness with a depth of historical understanding and context, as well as a lively human sympathy for the diversity of the region that surrounds him, which I, at any event, find almost unique. I remember interviewing him at the height of the East Asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of Asia as the growing centre of the global economy, as numerous foolishly triumphalist Western commentators were then suggesting. \No it doesnt,\ Yeo told me. \At the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years.\ It moved the graph a little to the right, it didnt change the trends. On that, Yeo was absolutely right. But it is also Yeos ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of Asia today which make him formidable. This week, Yeo spent a few days in Australia and I caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historical tour de force conversations in which he specialises. It is no secret Singapore had the most serious reservations about Kevin Rudds proposal to establish an Asia-Pacific Community. The Prime Minister wanted the US, India and Russia included in a regional body which could deal with strategic issues as well as trade and economics. Singapores hesitation over the Rudd proposal came because it thought that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which it is a key member, could be sidelined. I asked Yeo whether the region was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish. \We still need a lot more discussion,\ he said. \The vision is going to change dramatically, with the emergence of China and India on the global stage. The configuration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred. But thats the reality weve got to work with. We need a regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses. The single most important relationship is between the US and China. Increasingly, the relationship between India and China is becoming more important. I think eventually a triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in Asia this century - the triangle consisting of the US, China and India.\ Yeo saw Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith in Canberra and now describes Canberra and Singapore as being in harmony on the evolution of regional organisations. This is how he saw it having played out: \When Prime Minister Rudd proposed the APC, Dick Woolcott (Rudds envoy) went round the region. He did not visit all countries. He made it quite plain to some that only the big countries of ASEAN need to be involved. We talked among ourselves and quite soon the conclusion was reached that ASEAN was going to be sidelined. So there was an immediate blowback from the region. \To PM Rudd's credit he quickly clarified this, that ASEAN is central to his conception of the APC and that that was his vision from the very beginning. I said, 'All of us in the region are very relieved to hear that'. \Separately we had (former Japanese) prime minister (Yukio) Hatoyama articulating his view of an East Asian region apparently centred on China, Japan and Korea. It created, as you would expect, a natural reaction in Southeast Asia. That got us all thinking in the region. How to keep Russia and the US in the region in a way thats comfortable. For a long time weve been thinking about China, more recently about India.\ Yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations also evolved slowly, in particular the East Asia Summit, which includes Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN, China, Japan, South Korea and India. He said: \It took us a long time to create the EAS structure. Some preferred it to be based on the ASEAN plus three (China, Japan, Korea), harking back to (former Malaysian prime minister) Mahathir (Mohamad)s East Asian caucus. \Others felt thats too limiting. If its just ASEAN plus three, that may be a little lop-sided because of the economic weight of the plus three. So we thought if we have India on one side, and Australia and New Zealand to the south, theres a certain natural equipoise. \Then it took many discussions. The Russians wanted to join the EAS but we felt this should not be rushed. Russia is too important a country. There was some unhappiness from the Russians that we did not accommodate them in the EAS at that time. (Former US) President (George W.) Bush did not want to join the EAS but he worried that the EAS might exclude the US from the region. We told our American friends that it could not be purely an Asian thing because Australia and New Zealand were in it. In any case, countries like Singapore would never want an EAS to be exclusive. What would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs.\ So where do we end up today? \When I met PM Rudd I thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of ASEAN. So now there are two possibilities, either an EAS expanded for Russia and the US or a separate ASEAN plus eight (including the US and Russia) configuration. In fact I had a very interesting discussion with Prime Minister Rudd. I think in the end he's happy to let ASEAN members decide and he doesn't want to interfere in our regional discussion.\ So you can describe what Yeo outlines as either a win or a loss for Rudd. Whatever evolves, nobody is going to call it the Asia-Pacific Community and no one is going to imagine that Rudd was its founder, as everyone accepts that Bob Hawke founded APEC in 1989. On the other hand, it does seem as though its very much more than likely that there will finally be a regional organisation embracing everyone from the US to India, which is able to discuss security. That is pretty much Rudds policy aim and, as Yeo constructively puts it, Rudd has influenced ASEAN thinking. Friends of Rudd can describe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative. His enemies can say the APC came to nothing and was a failure in Australian diplomacy. Certainly Yeo casts it in a constructive light. There is only space to give the smallest sampling of Yeos prodigiously rich insights on other issues. On the US, he said: \Both Australia and Singapore feel it in our bones that the US will remain a great power for many decades. It is a vast country always throwing up new ideas, always on the boil. It has a sunny disposition. We in Singapore and Australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties.\ On China, I asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power, financial and military, so it could manage that new power in a way that was beneficial to everybody. Yeo stressed that he was sure Beijings preoccupations were internal, and said: \China is the No 1 trading partner for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India and already No 2 for New Zealand, and for all the countries (in Asia) the graph points in the same direction.\ (The historical process) is high drama in China. It was historically because of the large rural peasantry that Maoism developed as a different ideology from Bolshevism. China was 20 per cent urban. Its now 40 per cent urban and will go to 80 per cent or 90 per cent. The urbanisation of Europe was languid by comparison, but look at Dickens or Victor Hugo. Look at the huge reaction in Europe to urbanisation and industrialisation. In China its all compressed. If they succeed they will be the greatest nation on Earth. The Chinese know they have to learn new tricks. The skills which brought them to power wont keep them in power.\ He recalled that early in Chinas economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how Singapore, as a mostly Chinese nation, ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner, combining rapid economic growth with social order and a respect for tradition. Then that interest seemed to wane. But now Chinese delegations are back again in large numbers, fascinated particularly with how Singapore manages the politics of being a big and booming city. Mainland Chinese are even sitting in on politicians electoral clinics in Singapore, observing how real problems are recognised, integrated into the system and dealt with. I asked Yeo too whether he thought Japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in Asia these past 60 years. He replied: \Their politics now are a mess. Partly because they fit the pieces together so closely, reconfiguring the pieces is- difficult. A lot of Japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart. \The DP1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart, the Liberal Democratic Party from big business from the bureacracy. Never write Japan off. It takes a long time for them to change but when they do change they do it with a fury and intensity that surprises everyone.\ Japan has gone through profound periods of change in the past - the Meiji Restoration of the 19th century, in which it decided to become a modern nation; or the pervasive change after World War II, in which it decided to embrace democracy and the role of the key US ally in the region. The fact that it is now grappling with change is no reason to think it cannot emerge again with a successful model. Yeo is an old, old friend of Australia, and in a sense a long-term champion of Australias involvement in Southeast Asia. He has been a minister in the Singapore government for more than 20 years. He embodies a great deal of institutional memory and strategic continuity, not just within Singapore but within the broader councils of the region. Its just a pity he doesnt visit us a bit more often.

Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senate ratification of the New START Treaty: \The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, was signed by the United States and Russia on April 8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then, the U.S. Senate has held 18 hearings and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have worked with my colleagues to scrutinize this agreement and ensure any classified matters are properly vetted. Much has changed since the original START was first negotiated in 1991, and as a result I have supported efforts to make certain that questions regarding our ability to verify Russian compliance with the Treatys limits, to develop and deploy effective missile defenses, and to modernize our nuclear weapons complex, have been satisfactorily resolved. \I am confident that New START will provide predictability in our relationship with Russia and thus enhance global stability, and most importantly, our national security. Therefore, if the Majority moves to consider New START under a framework that allows for sufficient debate and amendments, I intend to support the Resolution of Advice and Consent.\

Recruit Afghan women to sell war to Europeans: CIA report WASHINGTON, March 27, 2010 (AFP) - A CIA expert has called for recruiting Afghan women in a public relations bid to persuade skeptical Europeans to support the NATO-led war effort, according to a document leaked Friday. \Afghan women could serve as ideal messengers in humanizing\ the mission for European audiences, particularly in France, according to the CIA analysis, posted on WikiLeaks, a whistleblower website. The views of Afghan women would carry special weight as they could express \their aspirations for the future, and their fears of a Taliban victory,\ it said. The Central Intelligence Agency declined to confirm or deny if the document was genuine. But WikiLeaks has previously posted government and corporate documents that were later verified. The report by a CIA expert on \strategic communications\ and State Department analysts of public opinion warned that popular support for the war in Europe was weak and could easily collapse, citing the recent fall of the Dutch government over the issue. \The tone of previous debate suggests that a spike in French or German casualties or in Afghan civilian casualties could become a tipping point in converting passive opposition into active calls for immediate withdrawal,\ it said. The analysis, dated March 11, suggested public relations strategies to drum up support for the war in Germany and France, which maintain the third and fourth largest troop deployments in Afghanistan. \Outreach initiatives that create media opportunities for Afghan women to share their stories with French, German, and other European women could help to overcome pervasive skepticism among women in Western Europe toward the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) mission,\ it said. Public relations efforts could \tap into acute French concern for civilians and refugees,\ the report said, suggesting highlighting polls that show most Afghans support the presence of coalition troops. Such an approach could stress the potential dangers facing Afghan civilians if NATO-led troops were defeated and \leverage French (and other European) guilt for abandoning them.\ \The prospect of the Taliban rolling back hard-won progress on girls I- education could provoke French indignation, become a rallying point for Frances largely secular public, and give voters a reason to support a good and necessary cause despite casualties.\ For German audiences, marketing efforts should underline how Afghans are reportedly optimistic about the NATO mission and how an international retreat would damage Germany's interests. \For example, messages that illustrate how a defeat in Afghanistan could heighten Germanys exposure to terrorism, opium, and refugees might help to make the war more salient to skeptics,\ it said. The report also suggested taking advantage of President Barack Obamas popularity in France and Germany, arguing that appeals from the US president on the importance of the allied role in the war could have a positive effect.

C05769769	From EUR: Update on Ukraine Election Situation With over 99.9 percent of the vote in Ukraine counted, Yanukovych leads by 3.5 percent (almost 900,000 votes) and is the clear winner and next president. The Central Election Commission should complete its vote tabulation today and must certify the results within ten days; certification is expected as early as Friday. Tymoshenko, who has been silent publicly, plans to bring cases of alleged electoral fraud to the courts, but they will not change the result. Tymoshenko claims that she intends to work within the law and not to incite street protests. Our recommendation is EU Ambassadors in Kiev have recommended the same approach to Brussels, but want to revisit it if there is no progress by Friday. Medvedev called Yanukovych today with praise for the conduct of elections, but stopped short of congratulating him on his victory. Following certification of the election, Tymoshenko is likely to appeal within the legal five-day period. This will likely push back an inauguration date until early March.

C05775024	sbwhoeop Saturday, September 25, 2010 11:08 PM H: the revenge of old Labour. Sid 0 aptember 26, 2010 John Rentoul: The party voted for David Miliband but got the Panda instead New Labour leader wont stand a chance against David Cameron The result is the worst possible for the Labour Party. A decisive victory for Ed Miliband would have been one thing. The party would have made the wrong decision, but it would have done so with its eyes open and with the leaders legitimacy unchallenged. Instead, Ed Miliband lost the election in two parts of Labours electoral college, among MPs and among Labour Party members, but won thanks to a 60-40 margin the other way among trade union members on a very low turnout. If he had won by a clear margin I would have said that Labour had chosen the Panda as its leader. He is soft, cuddly and panders to every oppositional instinct in the party. There has been no position taken by the Labour government of which he was a member that he was not prepared to trash if he thought Labour members would like it. Tuition fees, Iraq, the third runway for Heathrow: you name it, he disowned it. Even, in the case of the third runway, a policy for which he had direct ministerial responsibility. There has been no part of the manifesto, which he wrote, that he has not been prepared to ditch. But that is not what the party did. Labour Party members chose David Miliband. Labour MPs chose David. The party itself voted for what Ed Miliband tried to dismiss as the \New Labour Establishment\, in other words, the supposedly hated Blairites. The party read the signals from the voters correctly. It knows that, although it didnt do as badly as it feared in the general election, a lurch to the left was not the answer. Party members and MPs took on board Tony Blairs warning that Labour lost because Gordon Brown \moved a millimetre\ to the left of New Labour. They did not fall for the argument that Labour did better than expected by moving a millimetre to the left and, therefore, to do better still they needed to move a couple of centimetres further to the left. They did not think that, because Labour has pulled level in the opinion polls, the next election is in the bag. They know that the opposition party often moves ahead of the government in the opinion polls within months of an election. They also know that Labours poll rating is artificially inflated by the absence from the fray of the Liberal Democrats as a protest party, and they know that this protest vote cannot be relied upon in a general election. The Labour Party and Labour MPs got it right, and the election was won by an operation run by the trade union machines. That means that Ed Miliband, who would have struggled against David Cameron in the House of Commons in any event, is going to be roasted every week. Every week, the Prime Minister is going to point out that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of the members on the benches behind him. Not only that, he does not have the support of the members of his party in the country. Every week, Cameron is going to portray Miliband as the place person of the trade union bosses and the beneficiary of a boss-politics stitch-up. If Ed Miliband had won the party members but lost among MPs, which is what I expected, the Conservatives would have teased him in the Commons, but he would have had as much legitimacy as lain Duncan Smith - the choice of the party activists against the wishes of his MPs. No wonder Ed was the \cork-popper\ candidate in Conservative HQ. The way things have turned out, thats not just a phrase; it would be worth lifting the austerity ban on bubbly for. David Cameron, lucky general, faces an opponent with less of a mandate than IDS. Even if Ed Miliband had won comfortably in all three sections of Labours electoral college, I feel he would have struggled against Cameron.

C05764511	sbwhoeop Thursday, October 22, 2009 12:02 AM H fyi: Hague report and DeMint... Sid H: Here's the Guardian account of Hague's post-meeting press briefing. And below that the article on DeMint. S William Hague addresses US fears over Tories' EU allies •Hillary Clinton 'told antisemitism allegations are a smear' •Shadow foreign secretary opposes Tony Blair as EU leader • Ewen MacAskill in Washington and Nicholas Watt • quardian.co.uk, Thursday 22 October 2009 00.33 BST William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday defended the Conservatives' alliance with far-right parties in Europe during a meeting in Washington with the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton. Hague sought to reassure Clinton about the Conservatives' partners, some of whose members have taken part in commemoration services for the Waffen-SS in Latvia and questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom in Poland. The shadow foreign secretary, who said he had an excellent meeting with Clinton, told her the accusations were part of a smear campaign by the Guardian and others. The row has overshadowed Hague's visit to Washington intended as part of the Conservative preparations for taking power. Speaking to the media afterwards, Hague said the behaviour of Michal Kaminski, of Poland's Law and Justice party, was not consistent with anyone who was antisemitic. As for the Latvian party in the Conservatives' European alliance, Hague said: \This is a respectable party in Latvia ... To suggest it is antisemitic or neo-Nazi is ludicrous.\ Jewish groups in the US and in Europe have expressed anger over the Tory links. The state department was careful not be drawn into the issue, not wanting to be accused of interference in UK politics or issues relating to the European parliament. A spokesman said: \I can say that the two had a good, wide-ranging discussion on a broad range of issues, but cant get into details or substance of that discussion.\ Hague tried to persuade Clinton that the Conservatives Euroscepticism would not necessarily mean Britain would play a lesser role in European affairs. The US favours the EU acting in unison over Iran and other issues. Hague said he had raised the allegations of antisemitism with Clinton at the end of a 40-minute discussion on Iran, the Balkans, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and climate change. \No one has raised with me all day the other issue, of the parties in our grouping, but I raised that with secretary of state Clinton because of press reports in your newspaper [the Guardian] and others in case she had seen those,\ Hague said. \I have assured her they are mainstream parties of the centre-right ... The Conservative party rejects what it regards as a smear campaign against some of its members.\ He noted that Kaminski made his first speech in the European Parliament highlighting the problem of anti-semitism in Europe and had just completed a successful visit to Israel. \These are not the habits of someone who is anti-semitic,\ Hague said. As for the Latvians, of the six governing parties, \five of them have members involved in the type of commemoration that have been criticised.\ Some were members of the Conservatives previous alliance, the European Peoples party. On Conservative Euroscepticism, Hague said: \I always put the case to all American leaders that it is important to distinguish between Europe's institutions and its capacity to act ... I have explained to her and others that she will be find a Conservative government very active and activist from the very beginning in European affairs. \ Later he said it would be a mistake for Tony Blair to become EU president. He has previously said in private that Blair would be appointed \over my dead body\. http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-10/irm-contras-scary-sequel Iran-Contras Scary Sequel by Art Levine The Daily Beast October 10, 2009 I 6:55pm Republicans have opened a new front against Obama, a southern front, south of the border—Latin America. The clique of conservatives that has operated since the Iran-Contra scandal and held key policy offices in the George W. Bush administration is waging war against Obama in part through Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina. A freshman on the Foreign Relations Committee with no previously known expertise on Latin America, DeMint is best known for boasting that health care would be the \Waterloo\ that will \break\ Obama. He recently provoked a nasty spat within the committee by requesting funding to travel to Honduras to \assess\ the crisis. The Obama administration favors reinstalling the democratically elected president, Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who was expelled by the military in June. Committee Chairman John Kerry criticized DeMint for his \intransigence\ in putting a hold on two Obama nominations for State Department jobs in Latin America, and initially denied money for DeMints trip. But Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell somehow found funding through the Defense Department. \DeMint has been using this issue cynically to hold hostage the entire U.S. policy on Latin America in order to defend a coup,\ says Adam Isacson, a Latin American specialist at Washingtons Center for International Policy. \Little Honduras has brought all of the ghosts of the Cold War out of the closet, and paralyzed policy by provoking the [DeMint] holds,\ Julia Sweig, the director for Latin American Studies of the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. Some Hill staffers are even blunter: \These losers from the Bush administration who drove Latin American policy off a frickin cliff are trying to rescue their legacy,\ one aide told The Daily Beast. A number of Democrats and foreign-policy experts contend the mounting right-wing attack on Latin American policy has filled a void left by an Obama administration that was too slow to cut aid or take a firmer stance against the president installed by the Honduran military, Roberto Micheletti. Driven partly by a desire to appease opposition in Congress and distaste for left-wing populists the Obama administration \slow-walked\ its response to the coup this summer, Sweig says. More recently, though, the administration has toughened its approach by cutting off some vital aid worth at least $35 million and blocking Honduran officials' visas. The goal: to pressure the Micheletti regime to enter into serious negotiations with the Organization of American States to restore the democratic government and Zelaya. Informed observers say that indications of Micheletti's flexibility alarmed some right-wingers in Washington and helped trigger DeMint's visit to buck up the regime's resistance. An informal network of right-leaning American advocacy groups and ideologues was entangled in anti-Zelaya legal and PR battles in Honduras before the coup. Among them: Otto Reich, a Cuban-American who headed the State Department's now-defunct Office of Public Diplomacy during the Iran-Contra scandal, and was subsequently investigated by a special joint congressional panel—and the U.S. Comptroller General, which found he engaged in \prohibited covert activities\ by using public funds to attack Reagan's critics. Reich, who was later appointed by President George W. Bush to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs and is now a private consultant, launched a media campaign against Zelaya before the coup alleging corruption. \Your Loony Left sources say I was an architect of Iran-Contra like they say Im an architect of the Zelaya coup,\ he told me by phone from Panama. He disputes claims of illegal Iran-Contra activites as \crap,\ asserting they were only based on a fired House staffers unpublished memo. But Greg Grandin, a Latin American history professor at NYU, has a darker view of Reichs role: \Its kind of the origins of Swift Boating,\ he says. \Its all related to what hes doing now.\ Conservative supporters of the current Honduran government argue on arcane legal grounds against the worldwide condemnation of the coup. \Its not the first time all, the countries in the world have been wrong,\ Reich told me. He has criticized what he sees as erroneous reporting on Latin American controversies, taking The New York Times to task for an article last Thursday that he says implied he was being paid to lobby on behalf of the Micheletti regime. \I guess my facts interfered with [the] story,\ he says. \Can you believe some of my sources say The New York Times is malicious and deserves the slow death it is experiencing?\ A DeMint spokesman says the senator hasnt even met with Reich to talk about Honduras, although a Reich aide says theyve spoken to DeMints staff. Adding to the mystery of the coup, left-wingers in Latin America and the U.S. have floated what conservatives say are unproven conspiracy theories that Reich somehow played a role in destabilizing Zelayas regime. He has firmly denied them to The Daily Beast: \I cannot possibly answer all the Loony Left conspiracy charges against me. But I will try: I had nothing to do with the removal of Zelaya.\ But the rumors may add to his aura of power as founder of Otto Reich Associates. Hes drawn more attention to the new Honduras allegations by penning a column for the Miami Herald boldly headlined, \I Did Not Orchestrate Coup in Honduras.\ Perhaps the primary influence on DeMints thinking has been the right-wing Honduran-American lawyer Miguel Estrada, whose 2001 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was rejected by the Senate. In addition to Reich, other former Bush administration officials who have played key roles in influencing DeMint and in spreading arguments for the Honduran regime include Roger Noriega, a former aide to the late Sen. Jesse Helms (the far-right chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee) who also served as an assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs from 2003 to 2005. On July 2, Noriega appeared on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer to argue the legitimacy of the new Honduran regime. He was identified as a former ambassador to the Organization of American States and a visiting fellow of the American Enterprise Institute— not as a paid agent for pro-regime forces. Noriega officially registered his firm, Visions America, as representing a Honduran business group only in mid- July. Yet, the Times reported, he worked with the Association of Honduran Manufacturers to set up meetings between supporters of the regime and eight U.S. senators—including DeMint—in early July. That visit to Washington by Honduran business and political figures from July 2 to July 10, Foreign Policy reported, occurred at the same time as a House committee hearing during which Reich—along with a former Honduran supreme court justice and Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration official and now a lobbyist—testified in favor of the current regime. Noriegas office declined to return phone calls about his work. The lobbyist-organized visit also coincided with Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on Obamas picks for top Latin American posts: Thomas Shannon, current assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, has been nominated to be Ambasssador to Brazil; and Arturo Valenzuela, director of Georgetown Universitys Center for Latin American Studies and senior director for Inter-American Affairs at the National Security Council during President Clintons second term, has been tapped to be assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs. Both Valenzuela and Shannon were approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in late July. Julia Sweig of the Council on Foreign Relations observes, \Theyre not polarizing figures.\ But for now they're hostages in DeMint's war. At the July 8 nomination hearings, Valenzuela angered DeMint by defending the administration's decision to condemn the overthrow as a coup: \In my studies of military coups in Latin America, this was a classic military coup,\ Valenzuela said. DeMint's critics contend that he has continually refused compromise offers from both State Department officials and fellow senators to lift his holds, including the promise of an extensive floor debate on Honduras before a floor vote on the nominees. DeMint's spokesperson, Wesley Denton, says he's acting in good faith out of genuine concern about an important crisis. \If these nominees are such a top priority for Democrats, then why hasnt Senator Reid brought them to the floor?\ he asks. \There is nothing Senator DeMint can do to stop a full debate and roll-call vote on them.\ Technically thats true, but it would be a rare violation of a Senate tradition to do so. DeMint has taken up the issue of Honduras, Denton claims, because, \the State Department's actions were directly relevant to two nominees seeking the committee's approval.\ Yet before DeMint took up the crusade on Honduras—in what critics say is yet another vehicle to \break\ Obama—one congressional observer jokes, \He couldn't find Honduras on a map.\ Art Levine, a contributing editor of The Washington Monthly, has written for Mother Jones, The American Prospect, The New Republic, The Atlantic, Slate.com, Salon. corn, and numerous other publications.

C05770957	H: This may be worthless meandering on my part, but if the US unveils its own position in the new negotiations, inevitable if they are not to collapse, perhaps that position should incorporate at its heart what the Israeli government has already agreed to in the final status negotiations at Camp David, along, of course, with certain adjustments and amendments to account for the past ten years in terms of boundaries, etc. This puts the burden on Bibi to repudiate Barak in principles and details if he pushes back, splitting his coalition, and appearing to be the rejectionist. Also it makes the US seems utterly reasonable, for the Israelis have already agreed to the core of these positions and arguments cannot be made that they would undermine security, etc. Furthermore, three-quarters at least of US Jews supported the Camp David peace effort.

C05768507	sbwhoeop Tuesday, March 9, 2010 10:45 PM H: FYI, a little collaboration in the spirit of postpartisanship. Sid http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joe-wilson/emcourage-and-consequence_b_492602.html?view=print March 9, 2010 Joseph C. Wilson Courage and Consequence: Less Memoir Than Hoax Karl Roves book Courage and Consequence is less memoir than hoax. The chapters that relate to the CIA leak scandal are yet another attempt to deflect attention from his central role in the betrayal of Valerie Plame Wilsons identity as a covert CIA officer. His distortions and fabrications are consistent with his approach throughout this sordid and criminal affair. Wasting his opportunity to tell the truth, he offers absolutely nothing new, and his selective use of facts and quotes are a transparent effort to continue his long campaign to confuse people, unfortunately consistent with his past behavior. His book is a pathetically weak defense of the disastrous policies pursued by the Bush administration, involving our country in a war of choice based on false intelligence and badly tarnishing the good name of the United States of America. Nothing in Karl Roves book refutes those facts. His book, however, is illuminating in further exposing his political methods, especially his reliance on personal insults, not simply towards Valerie and myself, but also towards all those who opposed his unprincipled behavior. If any additional proof to the irrefutable historical record were needed, Roves book demonstrates once again the actions of a vindictive, angry and petty man. Karl Rove betrayed his nation; now he has betrayed history.

C05739859	FYI
C05767728	• oplose Window I[TA ==.---------- • Print this page From The Sunday Times February 28, 2010 Gordon Brown on course to win election David Smith and Jonathan Oliver GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Sunday Times poll reveals that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories. The YouGov survey places David Camerons Conservatives on 37%, as against 35% for Labour — the closest gap between the parties in more than two years. It means Labour is heading for a total of 317 seats, nine short of an overall majority, with the Tories languishing on a total of just 263 MPs. Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10. The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes the keynote speech to his partys spring forum. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron defied his right-wing critics who believe the partys modernisation has gone too far. He said: \Some people say to me, 'Play things safe; try to win by default — the government is in a mess.' I say, 'No. This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change': With the expected May 6 election now just over two months away, Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a series of pledges, including a plan to restore discipline in schools. In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory leadership in 2005, he will address the Brighton conference without notes. \This is very, very clear,\ he said. \Ive made my choice. There is no going back. This election is about change and we will be offering change.\ Cameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support. \The polls move around a lot,\ he said. \The voters tell us that they want change. They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed.\ The narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid. Until January the Tories held close to a 10-point lead. But a week ago a Sunday Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points, suggesting a hung parliament, with the Tories still on course to become the largest party. In the last election, in 2005, support for the parties generally held steady in the run-up to polling day. YouGov polling for The Sunday Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from January through to the June election. Labours margin of victory was three points. In todays poll, Labour has risen two points on the previous week, from 33%, while the Conservatives have dropped two from 39%. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 17%. The collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a hung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britains budget deficit. The last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn 2007. That was before Browns honeymoon ended with his failure to call a snap general election. The Conservatives went on to peak in May 2008 with a 26-point lead. Todays poll suggests recent claims about Browns tantrums and his intimidation of staff may have actually helped him. Just 28% of people believe the prime minister is a bully and 50% agree he has a \strong sense of right and wrong\. The survey disclosed growing concerns about Camerons elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families. Just 25% think that Cameron understands problems faced by \people like me\, compared with 35% for Brown. Furthermore, only 28% think the Conservative leader wants to do the best for \all groups in Britain\, against 39% for the prime minister. Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, the Sunday Times pollster, said that while individual polls could throw up unexpected shifts, the recent trend had been for a significant narrowing of the Tory lead. \Our daily polls should be regarded a bit like the FTSE index: a 100-point rise or fall in a day might be a blip or a trend — often we can't tell for a few days,\ he said. \I am confident the Tory lead is down this weekend but I can't promise whether the latest movement will be sustained, increased or reversed in the days ahead. One of the reasons for doing daily polls is to monitor these fluctuations.\ The Tory lead of 6%, which was first reported in The Sunday Times, was maintained in YouGovs polls in The Sun last week. The increase in support for Labour on Thursday and Friday, as the latest Sunday Times poll was being conducted, came as figures showed a strengthening economic recovery. Under the British parliamentary system, the prime minister remains in office after a general election until he either tenders his resignation or is defeated in a Commons no confidence vote. If the election result leaves Labour just short of an overall majority, Brown is likely to battle on, with Labour running the country as a minority government. The party would seek to do deals with minor parties such as Ulsters Democratic Unionist party or, if necessary, Nick Cleggs Liberal Democrats, to get its legislation through parliament. If repeated in a general election on the basis of a uniform swing in all constituencies, todays poll would leave Labour just nine seats short of the 326 needed for an overall majority in the new 650-seat House of Commons. The Tories would be well behind on 263 seats, with the Liberal Democrats on 41. Kellner calculated that, even allowing for a larger swing to the Tories in marginal seats, where the party has spent millions of pounds on campaigning, the poll was consistent with Labour being by far the largest party. He suggested that in such a scenario Labour might win 300 seats, with the Tories on 270 and the Lib Dems on 50. Labour will believe it is benefiting from the upturn in the economy. For the first time in a YouGov poll since July 2007, before the financial crisis, people trust Labour more than the Tories to run the economy. YouGov, which began polling after the 2001 election, has developed a reputation for accuracy. Its final Sunday Times poll in 2005 was precisely right, and it accurately predicted Boris Johnsons victory in the 2008 London mayoral election and the results of last years Euro elections.

C05767171	sbwhoeop Saturday, February 13, 2010 10:36 AM Re: also... Clemons posted this piece on his dinner with Petraeus, (its replete with a lot of punditry), but he told me more detail about his attitude and interest. Among other things, Petraeus recounted a joke about Gates speech at the Alfalfa Club dinner that Petraeus couldnt be there because he was in Iowa. Petraeus didnt tell that story to disdain the possibility. He smiled and watched closely for reaction from others. S February 13, 2010 Steve Cemons Publisher of \The Washington Note\ ../T1 • \ Pt r:1:° t „, •. N (1 :(1 Jr) F* az.,-.1,--anrac,sounga.awarnrmacta=ava-,_rmuacartatmott--=-0.... -rmaamaxatiAmasm...u.cnromar........,...r.nocura- -uarni.m.rarcnt.r.trnmar.rarti:4.3resecono....riatvars: I recently had the opportunity to participate in a small dinner with CENTCOM Commander . General David Petraeus and his wife Holly. These sorts of discussions are nearly always off the record -- but the fact that they happened is not off limits. Petraeus was not in uniform but rather wore what looked to me to be a brand new, perfectly tailored dark suit. I joked to him that if I Twilt.- -s ,rgc, that out of two dozen or so times I had seen Petraeus that this was the first time Id seen him out of uniform, an ice cold shudder of fear would spread quickly through some political circles in DC. In August of 2007, I wroteoiece, stating that folks should keep an eye out for the possibility that General Petraeus might run for President in 2012. In April 2008, Steven Lee Myers wrote a solid New York Times follow up titled \The General\ referencing my earlier take. Recently, legendary newsman Ai:nai4d de 13orchgave resuscitated the topic of an Eisenhoweresque future for the counterinsurgency guru in his piece, \President ?etraeus7\ Petraeus was recently named as one of Foreign Policy magazines tip 100 ttzal thinkers, and as U.S. News & World Reports \Washington Whispers\ notes, he is going to be speaking in May 2010 at the annual American Enterprise Institute dinner receiving the Irving Kristol Award. In January 2010, Public Policy Pollin.q revealed that while Obama held a ten point lead over a potential wild card race against Petraeus, the General had some strengths. But the pollsters also noted that many in the American public just didnt know enough yet about Petraeus to form an opinion: Finally our blog readers voted for David Petraeus as our wild card Republican this month and his numbers come out as a mixed bag. He has the largest deficit against Obama, trailing 44-34. But at +13 his net favorability is better than the President or any of the other Republicans we tested. The problem for him is that the numbers break down 25/12- 63% of voters in the country dont know enough about him to have formed an opinion. Who knows if Petraeus would actually have any interest in going into politics, but if he did he would be introducing himself to many voters for the first time. President Obama himself, according to what some of his aides have reported to me, is quite taken with David Petraeus and respects his approach and thinking. Petraeus has also been respectful of the President -- although when pushed at a recent forum about how he might react to a Presidential decision on Afghanistan that the General might not have liked, Petraeus offered a cryptic rather than clear response. (see above video) At the \First Draft of History\ meeting sponsored by the Atlantic Monthly/Atlantic Media Group, the Newseum, and the Aspen Institute; Petraeus when asked if he would support the President no matter what the result of the strategic review on Afghanistan responded that he \would continue to give the President the best professional military advice he could.\ Contrast that with Defense Secretary Robert Gates resoonOinato_the..saest.ipr .j., \We will salute and execute [the President's] decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability.\ But after spending an evening with General Petraeus and watching him closely for a number of years, there is no way that this intelligent leader -- with whom I have some disagreements but respect -- could be comfortable with the Tea Party takeover of the Republican political machine. There is always the possibility that a core of reasonable Republicans like Michael Bloomberg, James Baker, Olympia Snowe, Chuck Hegel, Alan Simpson, John Whitehead, Peter Peterson, Rita Hauser and others will try to rekindle classic Republican sensibilities by fighting to re-hijack their party back in an Eisenhower-like campaign with Petraeus at the lead. Remember that Eisenhower clinched the Republican nomination by promising to be the President who though he knew war would end the Korean War. Petraeus knows Afghanistan and Iraq -- and though it seems hard to envision today could be the kind of leader promising to end those wars if Obama proves unable to do so. But there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic David Petraeus running for President -- and that is his running for Vice President. I think Vice President Joe Biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the Obama White House, Biden has done the best job of outperforming expectations. He had given President Obama much needed counsel, not always taken regrettably, but counsel that Obama needed to show the American public he was getting. Biden has been the key agent behind the scenes in moving Iraqs elections forward. He has scored a lot of wins -- not reported -- in the nuclear/WMD controls arena. Biden has worked with Gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship with Russia -- and his counterpoints on the Afghanistan surge, in my view, remain compelling. But Biden is going to have to find a way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it. As I look at it now, Hillary Clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as Secretary of State would be a natural candidate for the Obama VP slot. Her franchise is not completely in the control of the Obama team yet, but moving Hillary closer to the White House (although her private home on Whitehaven Street is actually a couple of hundred feet closer to the White House than the VP residence at the Naval Observatory) would finalize Obarnas takeover of all the key political franchises in the Democratic Party -- starting with Daleys machine, Deschles machine, Kennedys machine, Edwards machine, and then the Clintons. But General David Petraeus, in his business suit, lurks out there. Obama seems to be concerned about looking like he is weak on national security. The Republicans -- at Cheneys constant goading (and now Sarah Palins) -- seem to want to continue to play politics through fear-mongering. Obama could neutralize the possibility that he faces a Republican party challenge by David Petraeus by inviting the General on to the 2012 ticket as a Democrat. Crazy? Perhaps. But inviting potential rivals into his tent is becoming a standard Obama trademark -- much as he did by appointing Republican Governor of Utah and former G.W. Bush administration Deputy US Trade Representative Jon Huntsman, Jr. to serve as US Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China. And get this, we have just learned that David Petraeus has not voted since 2002 -- not because he doesnt care to vote -- but reportedly because he wants to keep his eventual political options and political loyalties open. This is a soldier for whom all options are on the table and who is keeping his powder dry. My hunch is that whether Obama sticks with Vice President Biden or pivots to someone else, Petraeus will be on the short list of those considered. -- Steve Clemons publishes the popular political blog, The Washington Note.
C05762747	Below is the statement of very impressive Palau reps at the end of a session of required meetings on the next phase of free association aid. FYI only, the Palauans were insulted by the nature and depth of the response to their proposal as well as the content and the overall approach. They are even privately questioning the relationship. (This hasnt affected their intent to take the Uighurs.) I will send a few further thoughts. At the conclusion of yesterdays meeting, the Palau delegation caucused to discuss its reaction to the response of the United States delegation to the proposals that it made in June in Washington D.C., and expanded upon in subsequent communications. While the Palau delegation has agreed to respond to certain additional questions raised by the United States delegation on specific elements of the Palau proposal, and further has agreed to participate in certain working groups on specific issues, the Palau delegation was deeply disappointed with the response of the United States delegation. The United States delegation did not seriously respond, as required by the Compact, to the operational requirements of the Government of Palau or to Palaus comprehensive and considered plans to achieve economic advancement and self-sufficiency. In light of the foregoing, the Palau delegation has determined that it must now return to Palau to discuss with President Toribiong the next steps that Palau needs to take regarding the Compact.

C05772553	I thought that you might enjoy this by our newest S/P member, who was a journalist for the Wall Street Journalist and other places before she joined us in September. She is on an International Affairs Fellowship from the Council on Foreign Relations. They asked her to write the following; it was cleared by L. It is quite profound. By EMILY PARKER In 2007 I flew down to Lima to interview Mario Vargas Llosa for this newspaper. We talked in his elegant home, surrounded by thousands of books. Mr. Vargas Llosa offered me a glass of red wine. Then he proceeded to discuss why he believes that literature can change the world. Mr. Vargas Llosa's Nobel Prize is a great victory—and not just for a talented and prolific author. His work is perhaps the greatest rebuttal to those who believe that literature exists on the periphery of history and politics, or who claim that they have \no time\ for fiction. In a New Republic essay in 2001, Mr. Vargas Llosa argued for granting literature \an important place in the life of nations.\ He wrote, 'Without it, the critical mind, which is the real engine of historical change and the best protector of liberty, would suffer an irreparable loss.\ Mr. Vargas Llosas novels reflect his deep, personal hatred of dictatorships and his staunch belief in the value of individual liberty. He is hardly the only novelist to have shed light on these themes, but I would argue that he is among the most successful. Columnist Mary Anastasia OGrady on the anti-Communist Peruvian writer. A case in point is \Conversation in the Cathedral,\ the work that Mr. Vargas Llosa has said he would rescue first from a fire. The novel is set in Peru, in the dark days of the Manuel Odria dictatorship of the 1950s, which is when Mr. Vargas Llosa grew up. He told me that this was the book in which he wanted to describe how dictatorships impregnate \every act of life.\ To demonstrate this, Mr. Vargas Llosa paints around Odria rather than confronting him outright. The book opens with a grim landscape of \uneven and faded buildings\ and describes \dull and defeated eyes at the tables of Zela bar, hands that reach for ashtrays and glasses of beer.\ The narrative, which rapidly jumps from past to present, describes a stalled, confused world. You dont know who to trust. Mr. Vargas Llosa attacks politics more openly in \The Feast of the Goat,\ which explicitly details the horrors of the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Trujillo was notorious for his victimization of women, and so we see life under his rule through the eyes of one young girl unlucky enough to have crossed his path. \The woman is almost always the first victim of a dictatorship,\ Mr. Vargas Llosa told me. For some, Mr. Vargas Llosas victory will be controversial because of his political background and his outspoken views. He unsuccessfully ran for president of Peru in 1990, losing to Alberto Fujimori. During the campaign Mr. Vargas Llosa gained notoriety for his emphasis on a market economy, free trade and private property. He was no less controversial for his support of the invasion of Iraq, which he saw as necessary to ending what he called the \monstrous dictatorship\ of Saddam Hussein. Mr. Vargas Llosa has now left politics, and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen. Or as he told me in Lima: Through writing, one can change history.\ Not all of his work is dark. \Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\ is punctuated with humor, and The Bad Girl,\ about one man's world-wide pursuit of an elusive lover, is a thoroughly entertaining read. The one constant is a perceptive and empathetic glimpse into a wide range of human experience. As Mr. Vargas Llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature, \Nothing better protects a human being against the stupidity of prejudice, racism, religious or political sectarianism, and exclusivist nationalism than this truth that invariably appears in great literature: that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal.\ Ms. Parker is an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

C05764250	From your clips: US Responds To Sri Lanka Protest Over Clinton Remark (AFP) Monday, October 5, 2009 AFP WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States, responding to protests from Sri Lanka over remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said it had no recent evidence of women being raped while in Sri Lankan government custody. In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka's Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollagama, the State Department noted that the US government and international human rights groups over the years had detailed \numerous cases of rape and sexual violence in Sri Lanka, particularly acts committed against women held in detention by the government.\ However, the letter signed by Melanne Verveer, ambassador at large for global women's issues at the State Department said that \in the most recent phase of the conflict, from 2006 to 2009 ... we have not received reports that rape and sexual abuse were used as tools of war, as they clearly have in other conflict area around the world.\ \We hope that this clarification puts the issue in its proper context,\ the letter said, adding that Washington remains concerned about extrajudicial killings, disappearances and detainee abuse in Sri Lanka. \Secretary Clinton believes that Sri Lanka must focus to the future and move forward on the promotion of peace and the protection of human rights,\ the letter said. Sri Lanka lodged its protest with the US embassy in Colombo over the remarks made by Clinton last month to the United Nations Security Council. \Weve seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma and Sri Lanka and elsewhere,\ the US secretary of state had said during a resolution calling for an end to sexual violence in armed conflict, according to published reports of Clintons remarks. Her comments sparked an outcry across Sri Lanka, where government forces in May crushed Tamil Tiger rebels after decades of fighting. Colombo faced condemnation for its handling of the final stages of the war against Tiger rebels and managed to stave off a Security Council resolution calling for war crimes investigations thanks to the vetoes of China and Russia. The United Nations has said that over 7,000 civilians perished in the first four months of intense fighting this year. Sri Lanka is now facing international pressure to free 250,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who managed to escape the fighting but are now held in internment camps while they are screened to see whether they were rebels.

C05764805	Magazine The Power Grid Back From the Death Panel How the public option, helped by a congressman looking for an issue and a shrewdly silent White House, returned from the brink. •Published Oct 11, 2009 On the night last week when much of Washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the Baucus health-care bill by the Congressional Budget Office, Anthony Weiner was in his quarters in the Rayburn Building, merrily pissing all over the legislation instead. \It's just too weak,\ he told me. \It doesn't do enough It doesn't achieve real cost savings. There's no real competition. It's pretty much a wish list for the insurance companies.\ And those were merely Weiners substantive criticisms of the bill. His political assessment was even harsher: \Its effectively dead,\ he said. Not a droplet of Weiner's dismissal of the Baucus plan came as any sort of shock; he's been trashing the Senate Finance Committee's efforts for weeks. What's surprising is that anyone gives a fig what Weiner has to say about the topic in the first place. Until six months ago, after all, the congressman was known more for his yearning to acquire the keys to Gracie Mansion than his mastery of the arcana of Medicare reimbursement rates. In fact, as Weiner would be the first to admit, his interest in, knowledge of, and record on health-care reform were perilously close to nonexistent. And yet, since May, when he concluded that taking on Mike Bloomberg was a challenge that went beyond the Sisyphean into the realm of the just plain silly, Weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon health-care debate: the clearest and savviest (and, as always, loudest and noodgiest) voice in favor of the public option. And though it's plain that whatever bill eventually lands on Barack Obama's desk—and, yes, I think the odds are now close to overwhelming that a big pile of health-care paper will wind up there—won't be anything close to Weiner's single-payer dream, his role in framing the terms of the discussion has been more than salutary. In some non-obvious ways, you could argue that it's been essential. I should confess at the outset that I have a long-standing soft spot for Weiner, whom I first met more than twenty years ago, when he was a budding Chuck Schumer protégé and we played on the same Capitol Hill softball team. Weiner then was strikingly similar to Weiner now: amped-up, ambitious, wicked smart, forever gauging all the angles, unafraid of being (actually, proud of being) a royal pain in the tuchis. All the qualities, in other words, that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care. Weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as a matter of opportunism, in the best sense of the word. \This was one of those unusual issues where we really didnt have a mother ship that was directing the message, and that created an entrepreneurial environment,\ he says. \You didnt have the president out there speaking clearly about what he wanted. And among my colleagues, there werent people that jumped out who either had a comfort with the material or werent intimidated by the blowback\ Weiner laughs. \Frankly, I like the blowback. After my thirteenth town- hall meeting, someone on my staff said, I cant tell if youre a sadist or a masochist.— Weiner is right about the nature of the vacuum that he smartly stepped in to fill, but there are at least two other proximate causes for it that should be added to his list: the illness and death of Ted Kennedy and the migration of Hillary Clinton out of the Senate and into Foggy Bottom, which deprived the debate of what would have been its two dominant liberal protagonists. For Weiner, Clintons absence and its implications carry a personal twist; he is engaged to Huma Abedin, Hillarys longtime personal aide. \Its a weird irony that Im kind of part of the family now and this has become my issue,\ Weiner says. \If Hillary had stayed in the Senate, I would never have had this opening.\ Weiner allows that hes discussed the health-care battle with Clinton; what shes told him he will not say. But one imagines she approves of the cleverness and chutzpa hes displayed—especially in drawing an explicit analogy between the public option and Medicare, an equation that not only increases support for the proposal among voters but flushes out the phoniness of the Republican howls against a \government takeover\ of health care. And one similarly imagines Madame Secretarys chagrin at watching the Obama White House pursue a dance-of-the-seven-veils strategy explicitly designed to be the antithesis of the one she employed back in 1993 and 1994. Weiners view of the administrations approach hasnt exactly been approving—a point hes made abundantly and consistently clear over the past months. On the eve of Obamas September speech before a joint session of Congress, Weiner cracked that \up to now, the messaging from the White House has been done by Sybil ... They seem to have a different perspective on this every couple of hours.\ And hes apparently had no change of heart. \The president has been a miserable messenger on this by and large,\ he tells me. Such criticisms havent gone unnoticed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in no small part because Weiner—in a testament to his consistency, lunacy, inability to shut up, or all three—hasnt shied away from making them directly. Indeed, on a recent flight back to Washington from New York on Air Force One, Im told by one congressman who witnessed the scene, Weiner got into a testy

C05764892	Barack Obama snubs Gordon Brown over private talks White House spurned five requests from PMs aides for bilateral meeting Gordon Brown and Barack Obama at a joint news conference at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London in April 2009. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reufers Gordon Brown lurched from being hailed as a global statesman to intense embarrassment tonight, after it emerged US President Barack Obama had turned down no fewer than five requests from Downing Street to hold a bilateral meeting at the United Na tions in New York or at the G20 summit starting in Pittsburgh today. The prime minister, eager to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage in America this week, was also forced to play down suggestions from inside his own party that he might step down early, either due to ill health or deteriorating eyesight. There have been tensions between the White House and No 10 for weeks over Browns handling of the Scottish governments decision to release the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Browns efforts to secure a prestigious primetime slot for his keynote speech at the general assembly in New York were also thwarted when the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi, delivered a 100-minute speech to the UN, massively running over Browns 15 minute slot. Brown had not only been seeking a bilateral meeting with Obama, but feelers were also sent out to hold a joint press conference, an event that would have boosted Browns efforts to offer himself as a linchpin of international diplomacy. Government sources said that Britain even changed its policy on swine flu immunisation in Africa to match that of the Obama administration last week, in an attempt to rebuild relations. No 10 denied there had been any hint of a snub, saying Obama and Brown had plenty of chances to talk as they sat next to one another at the summits. They insisted they were working closely on issues such as future economic regulation, bankers bonuses, nuclear non-proliferation and climate change. Brown himself insisted: \I do say that the special relationship is strong, it continues to strengthen.\ But Obama has held bilateral meetings in New York with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, and the new Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama. News of the five spurned approaches compounded a miserable day for Brown at home which saw a parliamentary aide resign over the prime ministers refusal to sack Lady Scotland, the attorney general, after she was fined £5,000 for employing an illegal immigrant, as well as a withering attack by the former home secretary Charles Clarke. Stephen Hesford, Labour MP for Wirral West, told Brown in a resignation letter: \In my view, the facts of the case do not matter. It is the principle which counts, particularly at a time when the public's trust of Whitehall is uncertain to say the least. We have to be seen to be accountable.\ Brown was also savaged by Charles Clarke, who told the Evening Standard that in his view Browns leadership risked letting \the whole Labour ship crash on to the rocks of May 2010 [the expected date of the general election] and sink for a very long time\. He said he hoped rumours that Brown would quit would come true. \I think his own dignity ought to look to that kind of solution.\ In two interviews , Brown was forced for the first time to field questions about his health. \My sight is not at all deteriorating,\ he told NBC. Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live whether he might quit for health reasons, the prime minister replied: \I am healthy and I am very fit. I run a lot to keep fit and I will continue to keep fit. \I keep going. I have got a job to do. I have got work to do. We have got to meet this challenge.\ In his own speech to the UN, Obama promised an end to the unilateralism marked by the previous Bush administration, an approach that saw US and Britain working in tandem. In remarks that suggest Obama will focus on broadening American alliances across the globe, he said: \The time has come for the world to move in a new direction ... a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\ Last week, the White House had unusually briefed that Obama had told B rown in a phone conversation that he disapproved of the release of the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds, something No 10 had not highlighted. Megrahi was released on the basis that he had three months to live, and then received a heros welcome as he returned to Tripoli. Brown had said he respected the release, but insisted undertakings by the Libyans that the return would be low- key had been broken. In an attempt to distance himself from the Libyans, Brown moved to toughen his position against Colonel Gaddafi after Libyas leader theatrically tore up the UN charter in his address. Gaddafi said the security council should be renamed \the terror council\. Brown countered in his speech in New York later: \I am here to reaffirm the UN charter, not to tear it up. I call on everyone to support its universal principles.\ He urged world leaders to recognise that the next six months presented tests on climate change and terrorism that were as huge as the banking crisis. On climate change he said: \If we miss this opportunity to protect our planet, we cannot hope for a second chance some time in the future. There will be no retrospective global agreement to undo the damage we have caused. This is the moment now to limit and reverse climate change we are inflicting on future generations.\ He added: \If the poorest and most vulnerable are going to be able to adapt, if the emerging economies are going to embark on low-carbon development paths, if the forest nations are going to slow and stop deforestation, then the richer countries must contribute financially.\ No 10 again denied that the prime minister had been snubbed last night. A spokesman said the stories were \without foundation. As we have said throughout the week, the prime minister and President Obama are having a number of meetings throughout the week. These included a wide-ranging discussion following last nights climate change dinner. They will also be co-chairing an important meeting on Thursday on Pakistan and the fight against terrorism. As the prime minister has already said, there will be further meetings at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh.

C05770518	The writer is someone who has worked with Afghan women in developing small businesses in Afghanistan and is doing a book about the experience. She went back to Afghanistan for the conference that women had over the weekend and wrote the article that follows for today's Daily Beast. Soraya mentioned here is one of our Women of Courage. Gayle (the writer) told me in a separate email that De Mistura was very sympathetic and said they should be consulted, that the current documents are working documents and he pledged that the women would be more inovled in the follow up. He also told them that he was very impressed that they had organized themselves in this 2-day conference to be able to play a more effective role. Zakhilwal was gracious, but said they were adequately consulted. So it goes. Secretary Clinton may be one of the highest-profile attendees at Tuesday's Kabul Conference, but Afghan women fear their opinions won't be heard—and they worry new deals with fighters will roll back their hard-fought rights. As Hillary Clinton prepares to attend Tuesday's Kabul Conference, Afghan women are delivering a plain message to government and international officials: Women's voices should be heard. \We have to be honest. With respect to the Kabul Conference, we have not been consulted,\ said Soraya Pakzad, founder of a women's shelter in the western Afghan city of Herat. Her comment came during an unusually heated question-and- answer session with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal and United Nations representative Staffan de Mistura marking the end of a two-day women's conference. \We want to be involved in policy-making. We dont want our presence to be purely symbolic.\ \Womens rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or accords.\ The Kabul Conference is, in part, built on symbolism. A follow-up to January's London Conference, the gathering marks the first time Afghanistan has played host to its international donors, a decision that is intended to showcase the transition from foreign to Afghan ownership of national priorities. More than 65 international delegations are expected to descend upon the Afghan capital, which is already enduring security crackdowns and traffic gridlock. Workers could be seen Sunday painting curbs and planting flowers in advance of the foreigners' arrival. Discussions will center around five topics, including economic development, agriculture, governance, and security. The goal of the half-day event is to establish a framework for Afghan leadership in the setting—and execution—of the country's political and economic direction. Although it remains to be seen how quickly the Afghan govemment, long under-resourced and beset by allegations of corruption, will be able to take the reins from its international donors, there is no question that Afghan ownership is the direction in which things are moving, on the political, economic, and security fronts. And that is precisely why women feel the stakes for this week's meeting are so high, particularly in light of new deals to empower local militias that might threaten women's rights. \After the Kabul Conference, no one knows what else could be on the agenda apart from war escalations and negotiations,\ said Orzala Ashraf, an Afghan human rights activist. \This is very important for us, to get a serious and honest commitment from our government in the presence of all witnesses from the world that our voices will not be silenced.\ Ashraf and a number of other women's advocates view Tuesday's talks are their last, best shot at speaking out about their concerns, with help from European and American officials who have been working hard to help them win a seat at the table. In another show of support, Secretary Clinton and Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen will meet Tuesday morning with a group of women leaders. Regardless of this high-profile backing, many women say they have little faith in the process to produce anything aside from more paper and more unkept promises. \Women are very tired of all these conferences; the government is going to have to show commitments,\ said Selay Ghaffar, an Afghan Women's Network board member. \We want things to change.\ And it remains unclear how many Afghans outside Kabul, men or women, are paying attention to yet another gathering to discuss their future. \Women in the provinces dont even know about this,\ said Zainab, a young math teacher from Helmand province. \I would say 60 percent of women have no idea this is going on.\ Others say the presence of one or two women at the Kabul Conference isnt enough to make a difference. And they say they fear the recent move from NATO to empower local militias to fight the Taliban, particularly in southern Afghanistan. \This is very dangerous,\ said Shahida Hussain, a human rights advocate from Kandahar who worked as a community organizer during the Taliban years. \We had militias during the communist years and Afghanistan was destroyed. We fear war again.\ Women leaders say that they want peace and are glad to welcome back former fighters, but only if they respect womens constitutional guarantee to equal protections under the law. \Women should be a constituent part of all bodies outlined in the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Plan,\ said the women in a statement at the end of their meeting. \Womens rights and achievements should not be compromised in any peace negotiations or accords.\ In the meantime, women continue to fight for a voice as Tuesday approaches. After a weeklong flurry of conference calls, embassy meetings, and lunchtime gatherings, two women aside from government ministers are now slated to speak. And in a small victory for women, international officials agreed with Pakzad's assessment before pledging that women would be more involved going forward. \I agree, you were not consulted,\ said da Mistura, appearing to contradict the Afghan finance minister, who only a few moments earlier had said that women's views had and would be included. \As usual, we have been paying lip service to you and we are all at fault for that.\ Gayle Tzemach Lemmon covered presidential politics as a producer at ABC News in Washington. Since 2005, she has been reporting on women entrepreneurs starting small and medium-sized businesses in post-conflict economies such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and Rwanda. She is currently working on a book scheduled for 2010 publication by HarperCollins about a young Afghan entrepreneur whose business supported her family and community during the Taliban years.

C05767423	• • EUROPE NEWS • FEBRUARY 25, 2010 Obama Advisers to Aid Tories' Election TV Battle By IAIN MARTIN Advisers close to U.S. President Barack Obama have been drafted by David Cameron to help the Conservatives in their election campaign against Gordon Brown and Labour. The Tories have signed a contract with Squier, Knapp, Dunn Communications—a Washington-based Democrat-leaning political consultancy— to help them prepare for the first-ever television debates between leaders during a British election camialin. David Cameron The firm also is expected to offer some advice more broadly to the Tory leader on the Conservative campaign in the lead- up to voting, likely to take place on May 6. Opinion polls have suggested a narrowing of the gap between the two main parties—with the Conservative lead cut to six to seven points in the two most recent polls earlier this week. A Conservative spokesman confirmed Wednesday night that Squier, Knapp, Dunn will act as consultants for the television debates. Anita Dunn, one of the firm's senior partners, was hired by Mr. Obama in 2006 ahead of his run for president and was the communications director at the White House until November. Bill Knapp, another senior partner and veteran of the successful Obama campaign, is a close adviser to the mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg. Tory campaign insiders say they have been talking to the firm for several months after a recommendation from Mayor Bloomberg, who retains close links with the British Tory leadership. He was a lifelong Democrat who switched to the Republicans when he first ran for mayor. The British general election is taking on a particularly American flavor, with the prime minister also understood to be seeking advice from a consultant based in the U.S. The Times of London reported that Joel Benenson, a polling and strategy adviser who worked on the team that readied Mr. Obama for the American TV debates, is helping Mr. Brown. None of the British parties has experience of leaders' debates and as a consequence are looking outside for help. However, it is the decision of the Tories to reach out across the traditional ideological divide to senior Democrats that is surprising. Their party usually has looked to Republican strategists for advice, with Labour and the Democrats retaining close links. Ms. Dunn is a veteran of Democrat politics, beginning her career in Jimmy Carter's administration and subsequently working as a consultant on many election campaigns. She returned to the White House with President Obama but left late last year when her husband, Robert Bauer, the president's personal attorney, was unveiled as the incoming White House counsel. Mr. Knapp made television ads for the Obama campaign, has worked on five presidential campaigns and played a leading role in Mayor Bloomberg's three election wins. The pre-election atmosphere in the U.K. has become increasingly fraught, with the parties trading blows on allegations of bullying inside No. 10 Downing Street made in a new book on the Labour government by journalist Andrew Rawnsley. In the latest developments, the prime minister Wednesday in a GMTV breakfast television interview denied that he had known about briefings by some of his aides against Alistair Darling, his chancellor of the exchequer. In a remarkably frank interview Tuesday with Jeff Randall of Sky News, Mr. Darling said that when he remarked in the summer of 2008 that the worst global recession in 60 years was underway, No. 10 had \unleashed the forces of hell.\ Mr Brown said on GMTV: \I was never part of anything to do with this. Look, this was the most amazing time.. .and lots of things were happening in this time. But I would never instruct anybody to do anything other than support my chancellor, and I think Alistair will confirm that.\ At a rowdy Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons Wednesday, Mr. Cameron questioned Mr. Brown on the row.

C05770376	Under-Skin Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality By BARRY MEIER The likelihood that patients in the United States may some day receive heart defibrillators that can operate without electrical wires connected to their hearts has moved a step closer, according to a study published Wednesday. The development of the new type of defibrillator has been long pursued by a researcher, Dr. Gust H. Bardy, at the Seattle Institute for Cardiac Research in Seattle. And in the study in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Bardy and other researchers reported that initial trials of such a device in patients were successful. Defibrillators fire an electrical jolt to interrupt a potentially fatal heart rhythm and restore normal beating. For a unit to function, a surgeon must thread an electrical sensing wire through a blood vessel into a patient's heart. The wires pose risks because they can, on rare occasion, puncture the heart during implantation or fracture while in place. The new version delivers the electrical jolt by means of a sensor implanted under the skin near the chest bone. A power unit is placed under the skin on the side of the chest. The new device is already for sale in some European countries, but Dr. Bardy and others cautioned that full-scale, long- term trials were still needed to prove the implant's worth to the Food and Drug Administration. Even if successful, the unit could not be used by all patients who needed a defibrillator, but several researchers said they were excited by the new study nonetheless. Dr. Douglas P. Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out. In recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has been prone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or dangerous. Dr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device. \You are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,\ he said. In the study published Wednesday, Dr. Bardy and others reported that the new device had undergone several successful initial trials, including one in which it was used for a year in about 60 patients. The device is being developed by Cameron Health, a small company in San Clemente, Calif., that was co-founded by Dr. Bardy. Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone through several iterations. The device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly. But Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm that can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler. Before the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to theF.D.A.. Dr. Bardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year or more to assemble data from it for the agency's review.

C05773954	Keith Richards Has Memories to Burn By JANET MASLIN It is 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards's manager, a place that might look ordinary if every wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world's most glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards has a 3 o'clock appointment. \Come on in, hell be here in a minute,\ an assistant says — and here he comes in a minute, at 3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherds pie that Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones dont play until another shepherds pie shows up. Chalk up the promptness to the mans new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is far from the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself — very much about himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote \Ronnie,\ in which he described Brian Jones as \me in a blond wig.\ Bill Wyman, the bands retired bass player and bean counter, wrote \Stone Alone,\ in which not a 15-shilling demo disc went unmentioned. Now Mr. Richards has written the keeper: \Life,\ a big, fierce, game-changing account of the Stones nearly half-century-long adventure. \Its the most difficult thing Ive ever done,\ he says about the book. \Id rather make ro records.\ But he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl- eyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. Today, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he is positively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk of steaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head: both a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it. \Ive been through that phase,\ he says. \Dont know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.\ He's been through quite a lot of phases. And they're all on the page in \Life\: the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; the lovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted older one; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock over the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os.) All of this is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book's single biggest stunner is a hand-written note on its jacket flap: \Believe it or not, I havent forgotten any of it.\ How, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as \Satisfaction?\ \I think my main concern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,\ he says. \Fox had to do a little sleuthing.\ Fox is James Fox, the journalist and author of \White Mischief,\ who has been Mr. Richardss friend over many years and was his collaborator in putting \Life\ together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7 million.) Mr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richardss past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing upon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. \Spent day practising,\ the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in January 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. \Worthwhile, I hope!\ Also exhumed: a 1962 letter from Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs off \Luff/Keith XXXXX\ These artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Prousts madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste runs to naval history and the novels of Patrick OBrian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In any case they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and \Life\ began to click. Once his stories were told and a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox read B6 the whole book aloud. \What I couldnt guess was that hed be such a very good natural editor,\ Mr. Fox, reached by e- mail, says of Mr. Richards. \He cut, accordingly, for pace and rhythm — a real musical cut.\ As for calling the book \Life,\ Mr. Richards did some editing there too. \My Life\ was what the book was to be called. \I said I tell you what, just cut off the My, and youve got a title,\ he says. He might just as appropriately have used another title he likes, \Keep It Dark.\ But, he says, \Im saving it for a song.\ The contents of \Life\ are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was persuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a picture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? \I really cant explain it,\ he says, deadpan, about that now. \Maybe Ive got an honest face.\ It covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to have done successfully 30 years ago. \Stories like this arent told very much,\ he insists. \There arent many people willing to tell them.\ Then there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. \My most spectacular one was in Sacramento. ...\ he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding himself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, \Well, they either wake up or they dont.\ \Life\ has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book that pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. \Cold-blooded\ and \vicious\ are only two of the more printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an \old gasbag.\ Mick Taylor, the former Rolling Stone, \didnt do anything\ after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (\Performance,\ starring Mr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly enough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr. Richards remembers replying with this: \Later, pal.\ As for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity, unethical business behavior and — here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young Jagger and Richards vamp it up together — uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger's contributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like \Disco Boy.\ In conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blase: \Its bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is Im trying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,\ he says. And sure: \Theres the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it all out, those things count for nothing.\ Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of time. \The important thing to me,\ he says, \was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.\And is there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? \No.\ But is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As \Life\ emphatically demonstrates, the answer is yes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls \Keefs Guitar Workshop.\ Here are the secrets of some of the worlds most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on which they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for \Street Fighting Man,\ \Jumpin' Jack Flash\ and part of \Gimme Shelter.\ Heres how the silent beats in Elvis Presleys \Heartbreak Hotel\ worked their way into some of Mr. Richardss most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that \Heartbreak Hotel\ itself was the key to some of Mr. Richardss best musical memories. Some of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the laymans level. And he is surprised to find that early readers havent been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to do so. What he finds most gratifying about having written \Life\ is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the breadth and range of this books material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, \that what I hoped was worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.\ Its getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richardss name is emblazoned on a directors chair; where assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where theres a discreet little skull in the middle of the wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case — he did an ad for Vuitton — is parked in a corner. But the items likeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more cigarettes in a pack. \Do you mind if I smoke?\ he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certain legal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasnt touched the cigarettes. He hasnt even looked at them. He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted, diabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry white thing hes smoking. \That?\ he says innocently when asked about the picture. \Oh, that's just me lighting a cigarette. That's all I was doing.\

C05765160	sbwhoeop Thursday, November 5, 2009 10:18 AM H FYI: has some valuable info on af/pak. Sid tittp://www.qpi.corn/Ton NewsiAnalvsis/2009111104/Corranentary-Wariords-R-UsitiP1-16551?57351379/ ornment- Nanot T i s u ARNAUD DE BORCHGRAVE UPI Editor at Large WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UPI) -- If we are successful beyond President Obamas wildest dreams -- e.g., the Taliban is wiped out and a tough new Afghan government does not allow al-Qaida or other terrorists to conspire against us on their territory -- would that make us safer from radical Islam? The answer, of course, is no, because this is riot about geography. Two veteran intelligence operatives with much Middle Eastern and Afghan experience, speaking not for attribution, agreed a stable, secure Afghanistan doesnt change the equation, at least not significantly. The popular perception of al-Qaida in Afghanistan is the same propaganda news clip, shown a gazillion times over the last eight years, replete with terrorist \trainees\ in shalwar-kameez (knee-length shirts over baggy pantaloons) running through obstacle courses and emerging from tunnels, presumably to kill us all in our beds. Al-Qaida doesnt need commando-steeled volunteers to attack the United States and its allies. For the next Sept. 11, the chances are they have already selected highly motivated, brainwashed wackjobs among the graduates of Pakistans madrassas, who look forward to a one button push to the land of plenty in the sky where 72 impatient maidens await their arrival. Al-Qaidas \martyrs\ dont need Afghan training camps for WMD terrorism. In fact, to be inconspicuous, they should not have the physique of an avoid-at-all-cost likely to arouse suspicion. Al-Qaida does not need Afghanistan for its next terrorist objective. In fact, those who follow events in Afghanistan closely were taken aback when Obama said Afghanistan was a war of necessity because thats where al-Qaida. is. They havent been there since Afghanistan was liberated in October 2001. They moved to Pakistans tribal areas where they attracted volunteers from the Middle East and Europe. When a reconstituted Taliban insurgent force re-entered Afghanistan in large numbers in 2004, al-Qaida was not interested in its now insecure old training camps. Even if Pakistans current offensive.against the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal areas is successful, al-Qaida is not an entity that can be captured or destroyed. Its clandestine operatives are widely scattered in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North and South America. As alternatives to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Yemen, in the vernacular of the intelligence community, will do/is doing it. Somalia will do/is doing it. West African states whose writ doesnt extend much beyond their capitals will do/are doing it. Grimy North African suburbs of major French cities will do/are doing it. British provincial towns with Pakistani enclaves will do/are doing it. And the Internets thousands of pro-al-Qaida Web sites will do/are doing it. Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be comfortably installed in a tribal chiefs compound somewhere near Quetta, the capital of Pakistans constantly rebellious Baluchistan province, which has 48 percent of the countrys land with. only 10 million of its 175 million people. There is no al-Qaida central issuing orders to thousands of adherents the world over. If the:re is no connection between Afghanistan and the core problem of \no more Sept. lls,\ what are the United States and 41 friendly nations doing there? Even in the event of a Taliban victory in the years to come, the Taliban would not be stupid enough to invite al-Qaida back. Three months prior to Sept. 11, 2001, there was palpable tension between Taliban leader Mullah Omar and bin Laden. Omar complained that bin Laden was issuing \too many fatwas (religious edicts) which he has no business doing as he didnt complete his religious education.\ Omar also prevented journalists from seeing bin Laden. The Taliban leader knows he lost power and his country because of what bin Laden and his terrorists did to the United States. In today's Afghanistan almost everything turns out to be corruption and mismanagement. The average citizen has seen little benefit from expenditures in the $250 billion range -- on top of $1 trillion in Iraq. The .U.S. effort has been plagued by fraud, laced with mismanagement and bereft of strategic focus. One example among many others came in 2007 when the United States awarded a massive contract worth some $300 million to A:EY, a Florida-based company, to supply the Afghan army with 52 types of ammo, chiefly bullets for AK-47s. All requirements for safety inspections, mandatory for all ammo delivered to U.S. forces, were removed. Thus AEY was able to shop around in Eastern Europe for the cheapest ammo available. Millions of rounds of old Chinese ammo made in the 1960s turned out to be substandard. and dangerous. The State Department was aware of what was going on but did not object as speed was the only criterion. AEY and its officers were eventually indicted in Florida. But U.S. officials involved got off with a slap on the wrist. Wherever U.S. inspectors look, they find fraud and abuse. There are even cases -- reported by GlobalPost reporter Jean Mackenzie -- of American contractors paying bribes to the Taliban to ensure aid projects are not disrupted. This is a recipe for a war without end. She also reports a disguised Taliban office in Kabul that reviews all aid projects and determines the amount to be paid to the Taliban. If true, the United States is paying the Afghan government to fight the Taliban while also paying the Taliban to fight the Afghan government. The key lies in Pakistan. Almost all terrorist trails in Europe lead back to Pakistan -- and its madrassas. These are the free Koranic schools that have stepped into the vacuum of no education system for the poor as the military takes up 50 percent of government revenue. A fraction of what the United States has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan would go a long way to turning Pakistan around. Instead, Congress, in its infinite wisdom, after authorizing $1.2 trillion in both wars allocated $7.5 billion to Pakistan over five years -- with umpteen caveats. In a country of 175 million, a drop in the proverbial bucket.

C05768938	Jerry, as you may recall, was Guiliani's homeland security guy in NYC and became B6 one of the world's experts. He also worked for Clinton Admn and helped with disaster relief (including earthquakes) around the world. He called me today with some suggestions (some of which may be moot), so I asked him to put them into a memo. Here it is, for what it's worth: I think the fundamental issue is that no one seems to be in charge and no one person has been tasked with trying to pull all of the pieces together into a short term and long term plan. Obviously in the short term, search and rescue and food and water are the main priorities. There seems to be little communication between the various areas where people have congregated and a central command post where agencies can call or radio for additional supplies including food, water and medical. I don't recommend DoD be put in charge of this. They rarely have the kind of touch that brings together all the necessary agencies under one roof. I would set up a central command that has representatives from all federal agencies in one place. There is no reason things should be this disorganized. I would break the island into grids and assign one person to be the coordinator for each of the grids. That person will be responsible for all activities within their grid and will report activities to the island on-scene coordinator. We should get a radio company like Motorola to set up temporary towers and give the State Department several hundred radios so everyone involved in the response is able to communicate with the command post and with each other. I think one of the most important roles for DoD is to provide security for the rescue teams and medical teams. They also should be responsible for the operation of the airport, for off loading planes and for scheduling all incoming flights so there is no lost time waiting for planes to land. I also think DoD should be responsible for airlifting supplies that are requested by each one of the grid coordinators. Additionally, the helicopters should be used to move critical patients to the hospital ship on the way and to the aircraft carrier currently on station. At least once a day, the coordinator assigned by the President and the Secretary of State should be responsible for getting situation reports from all agencies on site, particularly regarding food and water, security, medical and search and rescue. The lack of command and control is allowing the situation to become more chaotic rather than more coordinated. I believe that if the Secretary were to talk to the other nations involved through the UN, they would be supportive of better coordination. Bottom line is that there is no order to the operation and you need strong people in there who can speak on behalf of the President and the Secretary and get things under control quickly. I hope this is helpful. If you or the Secretary have any questions please feel free to call me on my cell We leave for Tokyo at 7:15 am tomorrow and transfer to a United flight due back in DC at 2:30 pm tomorrow. Please give the Secretary my best regards. I hope to see you soon. B6

C05771631	For your Sunday reading, a summary of an interesting proposal by former Jordanian foreign minister Marwan Muasher. \Palestinian-Israeli Direct Talks: The Case for a Regional Approach\By Marwan Muasher (Carnegie Endowment Bulletin, August 2010) Marwan Muasher – former Jordanian foreign minister, ambassador, and deputy prime minister – advocates a regional settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, capitalizing on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative. His approach depends first on securing end-game \deposits\ from all parties: The parties would offer hypothetical commitments that they might not be willing to give at the onset, but that can be \deposited\ with the U.S. and committed to only if the other side is willing to do the same. Saudi Arabia's deposit, for instance, would outline and agree to a package that included details about Jerusalem. The Saudi package would also promise to secure Arab and Muslim backing for the painful compromises the Palestinians would need to accept. Muasher advocates a similar approach to the Syrian track—asking Syria to deposit end-game commitments in return for full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In their deposits, the Saudis and the Syrians must clearly commit to address the inclusion of Hamas and Hezbollah in any regional agreement. The Arab states would not only have to end all logistical, financial, and military support for these two groups, but they would have to assume responsibility for delivering these two actors, helping to transform them into political players. Israel's deposit would spell out its commitment to a solution based on 1967 borders and a return of the Golan. According to Muasher, these deposits would make it much easier for President Abbas to engage in talks aimed at ending the conflict. After he has been given Arab cover, Abbas could provide his own end-game deposits. According to Muasher, absent these commitments from the Arab states, the Palestinian positions will remain maximalist. Once the U.S. has deposits from all sides that make for a reasonable, comprehensive package, it should put this package on the table in cooperation with the Quartet. Once the comprehensive package is presented, the U.S. can focus on confidence- building measures to move all sides toward the end game. AM

Sid The writer was not only a correspondent for The Guardian there but also apparently was on the Maldives delegation putting him in various rooms. The accounts from the conference have been very fragmentary, the administration has explained very little (for whatever reasons and to its detriment), and it is being widely blamed internationally. The broader lesson I draw from Chinese disrespect for the president (and US) on his trip (I've heard accounts from journalists), its behavior at Copenhagen, mercantalist economic policy (eg, currency), and its rough use of and contempt for international organizations, not to mention the strange form of Chinese neo-colonialism in Africa, is the need for policy review. Fear of Chinese retribution (economy. Iran, etc) can't be allowed to paralyze reassessment, though it should be factored into scenarios. The Europeans are being damaged worse by Chinese economic policy than us and China policy is a new area for the Western alliance to consult on. Leaving it to Treasury apparently parks policy in a laissez faire twilight zone. Treasury has been as effective on China as it has been on AIG. Just thoughts of an observer.

C05769626	FYI: USIBC Launches New Education Initiative to Strengthen K-12, Vocational, and Higher Education Linkages in the U.S. and India June 2, 2010 - Washington, DC - On the occasion of its 35th anniversary, and looking ahead to the global economy of the future, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) today announced the launch of a new initiative aimed at strengthening institutional linkages between academia, industry and NGOs focusing on the elementary, vocational and higher education sectors in both countries. \The United States and India must be committed partners in building the workforce of tomorrow, a partnership that will unleash opportunity, spur growth and sustain prosperity not just in our countries but across the global community,\ said Harold McGraw III, incoming USIBC Chairman and Chairman, President and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Companies. \To do this, we must focus on strengthening our educational ties at every level. By working together our two countries can equip the next generation with the education and skills necessary to compete and win in the global economy.\ Mr. McGraw gave the keynote address before a packed audience of over 400 U.S. and Indian business, government, and education leaders at USIBC's 35th Anniversary Summit, entitled \A Pivotal Period in U.S.-India Relations: Tackling Education, Infrastructure and Inclusive Growth.\ On the eve of the first-ever U.S.-India Strategic Dialogue, India's Union Minister of External Affairs, SM Krishna, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, India's Minister of Human Resource Development, Kapil Sibal, and India's Ambassador to the United States, Meera Shankar, joined hundreds of top business leaders in Washington to participate in the U.S.- India Business Council 35th anniversary deliberations. USIBC's Education Initiative will serve as a dynamic platform for business, NGOs, and academia to provide vital input into both the U.S. and Indian governments - such that the synergies between American and Indian business and educational communities are unleashed. \We can talk about strategic, defense, civil nuclear, renewable energy and every other type of commercial cooperation, but if we do not develop the skill sets in our respective societies to sustain such collaboration, all this talk will never be successfully converted to action,\ Ron Somers, President of the U.S.-India Business Council, noted. \How fortunate it is that families across all walks of life in both our societies so highly value education. We have much to learn from one another, and much to accomplish - to prepare for the challenges of the 21st Century,\ Somers said. The USIBC Education initiative will focus on three thrust areas: 1. Higher Education: USIBC will host the U.S.-India Higher Education Forum (HEF) at the invitation of the U.S. and Indian governments. The HEF will serve as the premier platform to enlist academia, industry and NGOs to strengthen linkages between U.S. and Indian educational institutions from both countries. The HEF will provide a formalized network for industry, academia and the NGO community to provide direct policy input to the U.S. and Indian governments in all areas of education, with an aim to facilitate greater collaboration, including the opening of India's higher education sector. 2. Elementary K-12 Education : USIBC has embarked on a survey of rural and urban, private and public K-12 schools throughout India to identify best practices that are working well in educating students, while assessing needs where industry, NGOs and government may join together to fill gaps. With the support of Ryan International Group, one of India's leading educators, both financial and intellectual resources will be mobilized to transform these and other schools in a manner that promotes replication of successful models across India. 3. Vocational Training and Skills Development : USIBC will partner with its member-companies to feature Case Studies of Vocational Training and Skills Development that are being implemented across India. The exercise will attempt to enlist more corporations to participate in this important area of human capacity building. Programs helping to train thousands of workers will generate employment opportunities and sustain economic growth now and for the long future - in both countries. India is embarked on expanding its community college system, including technical training institutions, as well as inviting interest in implementing 30,000 new colleges and 1,500 universities over the next decade. The United States continues to be the most sought after destination for Indian students studying overseas, attracting as many as 113,000 each year to American universities and colleges. The U.S. wishes to remain a magnet for attracting the best and the brightest from around the world by promoting institutional partnerships between U.S. based educational institutions and new counterparts. Integral to this core knowledge infrastructure, industry must be involved in this enterprise. The McGraw-Hill Companies (NYSE: MHP) is a global information and education company providing knowledge, insights and analysis in the financial, education and business information sectors through leading brands including Standard & Poor's, McGraw-Hill Education, J.D. Power and Associates and Platts. McGraw-Hill established business operations in India 40 years ago.

C05771714	Basic principles for NYT ed board: US principles: gov't should reflect election results; gov't must have significant role for Iraqiyya (good for internal stability and regional integration); gov't formation should include a strong reform and power-sharing understanding; we want a gov't as committed to the long-term partnership with us as we are. These are principles backed by all Iraqi leaders, who need to make decisions now to break the deadlock. We have no candidate for PM. We have encouraged Allawi's Iraqiyya and Maliki's State of Law to see if they can work together, because that reflects the votes and would give the new gov't a healthy majority. But who fills what position -- that's for the Iraqis to decide. There may be other ways to have a gov't. But this should happen soon. Where we would have concerns: if the Sadrists end up with the power to veto gov't decisions or to topple the gov't.

They are surprised to see strangers -- five women and two men -- sitting in the chairs that the boys typically occupy. The students find some empty seats and shrug out of their matching brown coats and mismatched scarves. They are curious about the visitors in a lean-back, fold-your-arms, prove-it kind of way. \Im James Forman,\ begins a 40-something man. \Im a professor at Georgetown Law School and -- \ \You related to the James Forman?\ interrupts 17-year-old Carleto Bailey. \Im James Forman Jr.\ \That your father? James Forman your dad?\ Carleto demands. \Yes, I \ \Wasnt he some big civil rights guy? NAACP? Or SNCC?\ \SNCC,\ Forman says, seemingly surprised that Carleto has heard of his father, who was executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for years in the 1960s before becoming active with the Black Panthers. B6 \Hes a good guy,\ Carleto continues. \You tell him that.\ Forman smiles. \He passed a few years ago, but he would be happy to hear this,\ the professor says. He scans the room. The Oak Hill students, all African American, are dressed identically in khaki pants and royal-blue polo shirts. They have chosen seats on the edges of the room and, after sitting down, have pushed their chairs back as far as possible against the wall. Formans Georgetown law students -- African American, Arab, Latino, Caucasian -- are in jeans and sweaters. They lean forward, intent and maybe a little bit nervous. \I teach a class on juvenile justice at the law school,\ Forman continues. \And I thought this would be a really good way for law students to learn about juvenile justice. There is a certain amount you can learn from reading, but you also need to see and experience things. So I thought they would learn a lot from coming out here and hearing about your experiences.\ Carleto raises an eyebrow. This is a new one. \And the benefit for you is that they know things about the law that you don't. Ya'll have certain things you know. They have certain things they know. It can be a learning opportunity for everybody.\ Forman suggests they go around the room and share their names and an interesting fact about themselves. Dead silence. He smiles encouragingly. \My name is James Forman, and I helped to start this organization, See Forever, that now runs your school,\ he says. Carleto, who has been leaning back on the two rear legs of his chair, brings it down with a bang that sends his short dreads swinging forward and his black plastic rectangular glasses sliding down his nose. A few Georgetown students jump. He looks out over the top of his glasses. \My name's Carleto Bailey,\ he says. \My interesting fact is that I'm funny./I He gives a wide smile of bright white teeth. The Georgetown students laugh. Oak Hill student Ashawntea Henderson, 17, who sits next to him, rolls his eyes. But Carleto's not done: \And Im smart.\ But as it turns out, these Georgetown folks -- like his other teachers at Oak Hill Academy -- arent going to accept Carletos assertion at face value. They want more than good grades, more than the right answers on a multiple-choice test. They want him to prove that he can think. Forman shows the group an excerpt of a film about juveniles incarcerated at New Yorks Rikers Island. Afterward, the law students want to know whether a label makes a difference. Its a hard question. \Inmates? Residents? Scholars?\ one of them asks. \Does it matter what youre called?\ Carleto studies the woman's face to discern what she wants to hear back. It is blank. He struggles. \Not so much,\ he says, finally. He looks at her. She seems unconvinced. He worries that he has given the wrong answer and tries again. \Back in the community, there are certain [police] patrols in the neighborhood who say, I know what youre up to. When we come home, some of us are trying to do right, but they basically criticize us because youre already labeled.\ \What are the labels?\ Forman asks. This one is easy for Carleto. He sinks down in his chair and throws it out. \Trouble,\ he says. *** Carleto Bailey is trouble. He is also, as he rightly noted, smart. But he has arrived at Oak Hill Academy with a few disadvantages: He has been poorly educated in the D.C. public schools, was frequently truant and has had multiple run-ins with the law. The D.C. Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, which runs Oak Hill, won't release information on the specific crime that landed Carleto here because he is still a juvenile, but we do know this is Carleto's second time at the detention center. His academic knowledge is spotty at best. He can tell you who James Forman is, but not where the comma falls in a letter's greeting. (\Dear, Fidel\ he writes in a mock letter to Castro during English class.) He is a fairly typical Oak Hill \scholar.\ And, once upon a time, he would have been written off But today, staff at the fledgling Oak Hill Academy are determined to view the kids' captive time here as a window of opportunity to fill in some of the gaping holes in their education. Part of the reform initiative of Vincent Schiraldi, director of Youth Rehabilitation Services, the school opened its doors only last year and takes a unique approach to teaching delinquent youth. What would happen, Oak Hill Academy co-founders Forman and David Domenici wondered, if you seduced these kids with content that was meaningful to them? What would happen if they had lots of good, caring teachers in small classrooms? What if one assumed the kids could learn -- and behaved as such? In other words, what would happen if the District's most challenged students got a private school education, albeit on a campus of a decidedly different nature? \The bottom line,\ says Domenici, \is that the kids most at risk need the highest quality programming, but theyve gotten the worst.\ It is this conviction that drove Domenici, who is also the schools principal, and Forman to create three public charter schools for underprivileged and troubled students in the District over the past 11 years. Called the Maya Angelou schools, the two high schools and middle school attack educational deficiencies from all angles. Students attend small classes taught by specially trained staff. The high school day stretches from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with three meals provided. Some kids, whose home lives prove too chaotic for study, are offered supervised housing in the neighborhood. And it works. Last year, 93 percent of Maya Angelou graduates were accepted into two- or four-year colleges, Domenici says. (According to the Districts Office of the State Superintendent of Education, 29 percent of students who enter ninth grade in D.C. public schools and city charter schools enroll in postsecondary educational programs within 18 months of graduating high school.) It is a good model. But even though Domenici and Forman were used to teaching court-involved youth -- about 40 percent of Maya Angelou students had spent some time at Oak Hill -- working inside the gates posed a new set of challenges. Youth Rehabilitation Services has been under a court monitor for 23 years due in part to a history of abuse and poor conditions. When Schiraldi took over the department in 2005 and began his reform efforts by implementing a less punitive and more therapeutic detention model at Oak Hill, he saw immediately that changing the school was essential. \How could I look at my staff at Oak Hill and say we are about excellence when the kids were sitting in a school that was a total waste of time from 9 to 3 every day?\ Schiraldi says. Kids sat and watched movies all day. Little, if any teaching was going on, Schiraldi says. \It was a miserable, miserable school.\ Schiraldi immediately began lobbying the D.C. Board of Education hard to hire someone new to operate the school, and as soon as he got the okay, he put out a request for proposals. Domenici and Forman submitted a plan that Schiraldi says \blew the other ones out of the water,\ and in 2007 were awarded a $12 million contract to run the school for the next three years. Domenicis and Formans partnership is a somewhat unlikely one. Domenici is the son of former New Mexico Republican senator Pete Domenici. He went to Stanford Law School, worked in corporate law for a few years and then gave it up to teach and work with teen delinquents. Forman is the grandson of Jessica Mitford, who was the daughter of a British baron and a celebrated civil rights activist and journalist. Forman, who graduated from Yale Law School, worked as a law clerk for Justice Sandra Day OConnor and as a D.C. public defender. After seeing how few good schooling options his teenage clients had, he joined forces with Domenici, whom he met through a mutual friend, to start an independent school for 20 students in 1997. A year later, it became part of the first Maya Angelou public charter school. At Oak Hill Academy, principal Domenici fights with an occasionally maddening bureaucracy for basics: functioning boilers, permission for a college tour for a group of six students, classes uninterrupted by corrections staff who sometimes will call three-quarters of the students out in the middle of class to take their meds. Forman is chairman of the Maya Angelou Public Charter School Board of Directors and board member of its parent group, the See Forever Foundation. He attacks hurdles from the other side, fundraising and advocating for juvenile justice reform. \When David came out to run the school here, it was like \Oceans 12\: Go find all the people you can trust from your previous mission,\ Forman jokes. That included past colleagues and even a few Maya Angelou graduates. Samantha Crandal Simpore, who had been at a then-coed Oak Hill herself when she was 15 on an accessory assault charge, went to a Maya Angelou school and now runs the Oak Hill Academy welcome center. \I tell them, I was here, too,\ Simpore says. She tells each new student about how she was 17 years old and didnt know her multiplication tables, how she rode the bus to school each day hooked up to her Walkman, hoping no one knew she was listening to a recitation of times tables. \I say: 'You're at an intersection in your life. You know what's down the street behind you. Nothing you can do about that. But you have a choice about what's up the road ahead.'\ Many of the 90 Oak Hill students, ranging in age from 14 to 19, come in performing way below grade level, and nearly half have been diagnosed with learning disabilities. They are at Oak Hill for an average of 10 months, cycling in and out on a schedule that has nothing to do with a nine-month academic year. Out of necessity, they are grouped according to the cell blocks they live on to keep opposing gangs separate. Thirteen-year-olds can be in classes with 18-year-olds. More than half have been committed to Oak Hill for violent felonies. Fights are common. (Before the month is out, Carleto will get into a fistfight in the hallway that will delay his release date.) Through the use of small classes -- typically five to 14 teens work with one teacher, a teaching assistant and a guard -- the school organizes the curriculum around four-week themes designed to pique students curiosity and get them to think critically about the nature of democracy, social justiCe and their role in the world. For example, during the Relationship theme, students parse the types of relationships ranging from those between humans and the natural world (ancient river civilizations) to those between individuals and groups (Pharaohs and their subjects) to those between humans and ideas (liberation theology). At the same time, in English class, students will be working on the standard five-paragraph essay via the guiding question: \Why do relationships matter, and how can relationships be both good and bad for people?\ With the current unit, Change, the D.C. public school systems learning standards are woven into the social studies curriculum under loose headings such as \Changes in the Way Humans Think About the World and Their Place in It,\ which becomes a way of introducing the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment and the Magna Carta. Its a philosophy that emphasizes learning through making cross-discipline connections long popular in affluent, progressive schools but typically eschewed in schools for underprivileged kids, where rote learning and a return to such basics often rule. Oak Hill Academy has also created a course called Advocacy, which the Georgetown law students are co- teaching, emphasizing this months theme. Domenici believes learning how the law works in a democracy \is essential to teaching them to be good citizens.\ \We always believed that one of our roles should be to help kids self-advocate or advocate on behalf of a community,\ Domenici says. \We think this is a good skill for students individually and also one that our democracy demands.\ But this is an ambitious agenda, and Oak Hill Academy faces significant obstacles. Can you teach teens to think critically when theyre missing the basic underpinnings of education? How do you teach empowerment in a setting that demands rigid compliance to keep kids from misbehaving? Although he sometimes grows discouraged, Domenici does his best to buoy his staff members when they learn that one of their most promising students got into a fight on the unit or \graduated\ from the program only to commit another crime and be sent back. \I talk to staff about the fact that, day to day, our job is to do the absolute best work you can in the domain that is within your control,\ he says, reminding them that they dont control all the pieces of the puzzle. \And if you do that well, you have done the moral and just thing.\ His staff members must keep the faith while straddling what are to them two equally potent realities: First, knowledge is power, and through possessing it, every student is capable of success. And, absent the right support, failure lurks right around the corner. It sounds like this: \I think Carleto has a good chance of finishing high school and going on to college,\ Domenici says. Pause. \Also, he is highly at risk of not doing that.\ *** It is a cold day in late January, and Oak Hill is in the midst of the four-week session on change. Dressed in jeans, a blue shirt and a gray corduroy jacket (the heats not working), Oak Hill social studies teacher John Adams paces around the room and then stops to bend over Carleto, who is doodling on a piece of paper at his desk. \Pay attention,\ he says, taking Carletos pencil. \Carleto, what is today's essential question?\ \What is historical change, and how is it different from other kinds of change?\ Carleto says, reading from the board where Adams has scrawled his topic. \Yes,\ Adams says. He ignores a student who is wandering around the room aimlessly, until the student snatches a hat off a classmate and tosses it toward the hallway. A youth development specialist, which is how corrections guards are referred to under Schiraldi, appears to be deeply engrossed in a magazine in the back of the room. But she snatches the hat from mid-air, scowls at the disruptive student and tucks the hat in her pocket. \Please sit,\ Adams tells the student. Not quite sitting, not quite standing, the student perches on the edge of Adamss desk. Good enough. Adams continues: \Whats the difference between personal change and historical change?\ Silence. \Anybody? More silence. \Ashawntea?\ \Historical change is like a revolution,\ Ashawntea says. Adams throws out a list of changes -- getting a raise in salary, moving to a new house, the election of President Obama -- and Carleto accurately sorts the changes into micro and macro, personal and historical. \Obama's campaign was all about change,\ Adams says. \Do you think he is talking historical change?\ He wants the students to think about the president, who has been in office now for two days. What might his first 100 days look like? he asks the students. \What advice would you offer him?\ Carleto looks stumped. \Just throw out some ideas,\ Adams prompts. He tells the students that they are going to craft their own letters to the president, advising him on how to set his agenda for change. Carleto slaps his pencil down on the desk. \Obama's not reading our letters,\ he says. He folds his arms across his chest, skeptical that the president will lay eyes on this letter -- and skeptical, perhaps, that the teachers really want to hear his ideas. *** Later, Carleto will acknowledge that he knows quite a bit about the president, as he is reading Barack Obamas \Dreams From My Father.\ \It started off as a good book, but it got excellent,\ he says. He struggles hard to articulate the books themes and appeal. \I don't know how to put it,\ he says finally, \but growing up with -- no disrespect, but -- a Caucasian mom and an African father, he still made it through.\ Sitting in a guards room off the gym on a February evening, the echoing sound of classmates bouncing basketballs around the cavernous gym, Carleto goes on to tell his own possibly apocryphal story. \As a child, he was very fun, happy -- as far as kindergarten through sixth grade. Starting in first grade, he was on the honor roll and was also making it to school every day,\ he says, beginning in third person, but quickly lapsing into first. \In the late stages of middle school; at the end of eighth grade, I started smoking weed, doing stuff I wasnt supposed to be doing.\ He takes full responsibility. \No one peer-pressured me or anything. I was liking what was going on when I was high,\ he explains. He, like almost all the teens at Oak Hill, denies being involved in a gang. Still, Carleto says that his best friend since elementary school was killed in 10th grade in \a neighborhood thing.\ \Nowadays, anyone can just ride up on you, and you can be mistaken for someone else and be shot,\ he says, explaining that his buddy was shot because of a \miscommunication.\ \It wasnt intended for us,\ he says, insisting that he and his friend, nicknamed \Smoke,\ were just waiting for the bus. Then he announces, \I dont want to talk about it.\ So he doesn't, though it clearly haunts him: He will doodle \R.I.P. Smoke\ on the cover of his blue folder or on a piece of loose-leaf paper or the comer of the chalkboard. He's happy to talk about Oak Hill Academy though, where he has a 3.5 grade-point average after six months. (Domenici says Carleto is in the top 25 percent of students at Oak Hill and tests fairly high on assessments.) Carleto likes the school even though it is a bit easy for him, being a senior in with freshman. He complains that the classes are too short and that the guards are always interrupting them to move on just when the class is getting warmed up. That really bugs him, but he doesn't say much. He says that he will be leaving Oak Hill in two months and intends to finish his schooling at Oak Hill's transition center in the District, from which he says he will graduate this June. When he gets out, there are a couple of things he wants to do right off, he says. First, he intends to see his girlfriend, then go out to a restaurant and then go to \the Adidas shop in Georgetown, where my mom will get me some stuff-- and my dad, too.\ He says his mom was pretty upset when he got arrested and sent to Oak Hill. \She was. . . Im going to say she was kind of like surprised at my actions, what I done,\ Carleto says. \You know how they say Whatever hides in the dark, comes out?. . . She was not ashamed of me, but disappointed in me.\ Meanwhile, she makes the long, 45-minute trek from the District to Laurel to visit. \Every weekend, both days!\ he says. He is alternately vague and specific when he describes his family life. He has four brothers -- ages 27, 23, 16 and 11 -- and reports that he and his two younger brothers live with his mom. He says his mom works as a secretary, but he struggles to remember where. \She was working with, whats that program downtown by the Washington Monument, dealing with Smokey the Bear?. . . Im trying to think. Its right by the Holocaust Museum. Its a brick building. She works there.\ Later, Carletos school case worker, Essence Jones, will offer a somewhat different account of Carletos life. Although Carleto is in 12th grade, he will not graduate in June as he says. He is still six credits shy, Jones says. And it will be at least three months -- not two -- before his release. Carletos father is not part of his life, Jones says. The teenager had been living with his aunt before coming to Oak Hill. His mother, who has a rap sheet dating to 1982, has been in and out of jail for years, arrested repeatedly for a string of felonies and misdemeanors, including possession and distribution of drugs, as well as prostitution. She has been in prison since 2005, serving three consecutive sentences totaling seven years for assault with a dangerous weapon, attempted distribution of cocaine and violation of bail. She is not visiting Carleto on weekends. *** By the end of February, still in the midst of the unit on change, the Oak Hill teens file into their advocacy class, jostling each other, edgy. It is unseasonably warm outside, and they do not want to be here. Reluctantly they take their seats, and Carleto positions himself so that he can see the patch of brown grass and mud in the prison yard, visible through the door someone has wedged open. Occasionally, a breeze wafts into the room. Today, the law students decide to tackle the topic of disproportionate minority confinement. If youths of color are 35 percent of the general population in the United States, but 62 percent of the prison population, this is disproportionate minority confinement, the law students explain. They refer the teens to a handout each has on the desk in front of him, an article excerpt from New American Media, \Racism of the Juvenile Justice System Revealed,\ to explain that this isnt simply because people of color commit more crimes: \African-American youths are 4.5 times more likely, and Latinos 2.3 times more likely, than white youths to be detained for identical offenses. About half of white teenagers arrested on a drug charge go home without being formally charged and drawn into the system. Only one-quarter of black teens arrested on drug charges catch a similar break.\ Although youth of color are 100 percent of Oak Hills population of inmates and, indeed, 100 percent of all 721 juvenile delinquents currently committed to Youth Rehabilitation Services care in settings across the city, disproportionate minority confinement is a hard concept for the teens to grasp. Georgetown student Abby Fee tries a pie graph, a bar graph, a sketch of disproportionate Xs and Os. Blank stares. Then it slowly dawns on Ashawntea what theyre talking about. \Hey,\ he says, suddenly sitting forward. \Theyre switched around! Basically, theres more of us juveniles in prison than white juveniles -- even though theres more of them.\ \Yes,\ Fee says. \So the population outside the system looks a lot different from that inside the system.\ Ashavvntea sits back in his chair to mull this over. Fee and the other law students move the teens from the statistics to a speculative discussion about the reasons behind these figures. They have prepared a role-playing game to coax the teens into thinking about this from different perspectives. Then, they want the students to practice advocating for change. \So, were going to have three roles,\ Fee says, dividing the teens into pairs. \One group is a 15-year-old; one group is playing a math teacher; and one group is playing a city council member.\ Carleto and his partner learn that they are to play a city council member who is preparing a presentation on reforming the police department. Carleto doesnt want to be a city council member. He doesnt even want to be here today. He wraps and unwraps his pencil in the bottom of his T-shirt. He puts his glasses on, then takes them off. \How could you maintain better relationships\ with police? Fee asks, settling herself into a chair to help Carleto and his partner work through this. Carleto throws his pencil down on the table. Wont answer. She asks again. Silence. Finally, he offers a sullen challenge. \Stop harassing people for no reason?\ \How do you want them to treat people?\ \Equally,\ he says. He picks up the pencil and tap, tat, taps it on the desk. Fee tries to get him to be more specific. \Don't arrest for small problems. Instead, take them home, and tell your family what you're doing,\ Carletos partner says, unconsciously slipping into second person. \And how do you think they can help crime be stopped or decreased in general?\ Fee prods. A long pause. Could be their minds are whirring busily; could be theyre spacing out. Fee, a teacher before enrolling at Georgetown, takes it in stride. She taps the paper a couple of times and repeats the question. \Don't have 10 or 15 cars patrolling and then have an area where you barely see a police car,\ Carleto says. \Patrol each ward equally?\ asks Fee. Carleto writes that down, then adds: \I see a lot of cruel things they done that ain't right.\ Fee nods, encourages him to write it down. Carletos partner grabs the pencil and speaks as he writes. \The majority of police shouldnt carry guns. I could say, The majority of police are racist.\ \But how would you fix that?\ Fee. prods. \A camera on their car to catch them if theyre doing it -- but a secret one,\ Carleto suggests. He sits up straighter in his chair. \And dont just pull over people because theyre black. They can say anything, thats the reason why I pulled you over, because your headlights are off or whatever.\ Suddenly, Carleto is on a roll, and he rattles off a list of improvements. \Call to order of the city council,\ says Georgetown student Dania Ayoubi. Carleto and his partner stand in the front of the class. \Hello, Im Mr. Jones, and I am a city councilman,\ Carleto says, glancing down at his paper and twisting the tail of his shirt with his free hand. \We have some complaints from the different communities and wards about police, and these are some of our suggestions about cracking down on officers.\ He sounds nervous as he begins the list. \Stop harassing minorities and other ethnic youths, and treat them equal to the same race that you are. Also, police dont arrest if there is a situation at the school like a fight or anything. I feel they should not be arrested but taken home. Then tell their parents why this happened and what the reason was for being stopped by the police.\ He moves briskly through the suggestions and twice, tentatively, tries actually making eye contact with the audience. In conclusion, he says, \verbally abusing\ youth won't be tolerated any more. \Basically, we want to crack down on the officers and have them removed, if so.\ Another pair of students rises to begin a presentation, but the teens are interrupted by the crackle of a guard's walkie-talkie. \Time to go!\ the guard announces. The law students are surprised -- they are not quite done -- but politely acquiesce. \Wait!\ Ashawntea says, standing up. \We got 10 more minutes.\ \It will take you five minutes to get your stuff together and get your coats on,\ the guard says. \But we have 10 minutes!\ Carleto insists. He and Ashawntea sit back down and fold their arms. \Its only 2:20. We got 10 more minutes still.\ The guard takes a beat, then shrugs and concedes Carletos point. He goes back out into the hall to wait. Carleto shoots Ashawntea a look of surprise. His advocacy worked. \Yesss!\ Ashawntea hisses under his breath.

C05772378	http://www.politico.com/static/PPM170_101005_boehner.html Our top message--exposing Boehner as beholden to special interests--beat the Republicans\ attack by 20 points with swing voters. Our second highest rated message--connecting Karl Rove\s secret efforts to hijack our elections to Boehner--beat the Republican attack by 15 points with swing voters and was the top rated message among Democratic likely voters. Branding Boehner RAPIDRESPONSEMEMO•OCTOBER 6 , 2 1 0 ANALYST:DREWWESTEN,PH.D.,WESTENSTRATEGIES Karl Rove is back in business -- directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to GOP campaigns to hijack our elections and our public discourse. If hes successful, John Boehner will become Speaker of the House. But the last thing Rove wants is for Boehner to be seen as the face of the GOP. Thats why hes claiming its an —inexplicable— mistake for President Obama to put Boehner front and center. Progressives know better than to take advice from Rove. Our new message testing shows that progressives should not only talk about Boehner but define him and his agenda. Every narrative we tested about Boehner -- from his loyalty to special interests and corporate donors over the interests of the middle class to Karl Roves efforts to elevate him as Speaker -- beat the Republicans\ toughest attack language on Obama, Pelosi and Reid. Currently, Boehner is largely unknown, but when voters are told about him, they don't like what they hear. The following \\one-liners\ beat GOP attack rhetoric by double digits with both likely and swing votersii: The brief statements above beat this Republican attack: \Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive government and destroyed our economy in the process. John Boehner and the Republicans won't let them continue.— Does Not Speak for Us or Our Values We need a Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans. I.] The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Unfortunately, we know where John Boehner\s heart is, and it ish\t with the middle class. C.,' We need moderation, not extremism. If John Boehner wants to speak for a party that has vowed to end Social Security, Medicare and public education--and force women who\ve been raped to bear their rapists child--thats his business. But he doesn\t speak for America or American values. Cares More about Special Interests LI Ordinary Americans need a Speaker for their interests, not for the interests of billionaires and corporations that are outsourcing our jobs. OIt's not hard to keep a tan like John Boehner\s when you\re always out on the golf course with some CEO or lobbyist. • It's time we return to government of, by, and for the people, not government of, bought, and paid for by special interests. But in John Boehner, big business has finally found their man. Helped Invent the Problems We Face OJohn Boehner understands deficits. He\s spent nearly 20 years in Washington creating them. OJohn Boehner knows the ways of Washington. He helped invent them: Earmarks, deficits, and tax breaks for corporations that outsource our jobs to China. Branding Boehner Page 2 KEYS TO CONNECTING 1. Emphasize whose voices matter to Boehner: Voters want a Speaker who listens to the voice of the people, not the big corporations and lobbyists who Boehner represents. 2.Draw a strong contrast between the interests of working Americans and the special interests of powerful corporations: Speak strongly to populist themes that focus on the loyalty of Boehner and the Republicans in Congress to their corporate donors, like the tobacco CEOs whose campaign donations Boehner handed out on the House floor, over the interests and values of ordinary Americans. 3.Focus on realities that are hard for Boehner to defend: the social and economic extremism of his party and his long history in Washington helping to create the problems we face today. NARRATIVES THAT BEAT THE GOP ATTACK Longer narratives against Boehner beat a similar, but more in-depth Republican message, based on language drawn directly from Boehner and other conservative leaders: Our top message--exposing Boehner as beholden to special interests--beat the Republicans\ attack by 20 points with swing voters. Our second highest rated message--connecting Karl Rove\s secret efforts to hijack our elections to Boehner--beat the Republican attack by 15 points with swing voters and was the top rated message among Democratic likely voters. i We surveyed a national sample of 1,013 adults matching the demographics of registered voters from October 2-3, 2010 using online dial testing. We analyzed their responses as they listened to narratives to understand what they found compelling, as well as their overall ratings of each narrative and additional \one-liners.\ The numbers reported here are likely underestimates of the strength of the narratives, as the statistics refer to the original narratives tested prior to revising them based on analysis of online dial tests. ii Swing voters are defined as those who described themselves as anywhere from weak/moderate Republicans through Independents to weak/moderate Democrats. THE REPUBLICAN ATTACK ON OBAMA, PELOS1 AND REID Obama, Pelosi and Reid have abused their power to impose an expansive and intrusive government and destroyed our economy in the process. Democrats think they can get away with their job-killing agenda by ramming it down peoples throats, excluding opposing viewpoints and eliminating fair debate. They are turning their backs on American families and businesses as they continue to tax, borrow and spend into oblivion. John Boehner and the Republicans believe government should reflect the priorities of the American people--priorities that have been ignored, even mocked by the powers-that-be in Washington. Obama, Pelosi and Reid must be stopped from raising taxes on any American during a recession and spending money we don\t have on big government programs no one wants. John Boehner and the Republicans are listening to the American people and understand that government is not the answer, its the problem. \Boehner and Rove\- After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under, most of us thought we\d never hear again from Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush revolution. But Rove is back in business, directing tens of millions in secret corporate cash to hijack our elections, running ads against Members of Congress who want to put the public interest over the special interests. He and John Boehner aren't working for ordinary Americans. They\re working for the big corporations that outsource our jobs and get tax breaks for doing it. Boehner\s voted down the line for big bonuses for bankers, big tax breaks for big oil, and big loopholes for insurance companies that discriminate against people with \pre-existing conditions\ which is all of us if we just live long enough. We should be restoring the American Dream for all Americans, not just for the few, and we need a Speaker who stands with the middle class. \They found their man\- We need to return to government of, by, and for the people, not government of, bought, and paid for by special interests. It\s time billionaires and big businesses paid their fair share of taxes rather than paying politicians to give them special tax breaks and loopholes. They\re putting a lot of money into John Boehner, and for good reason: they know as Speaker, he\d speak for them, not for ordinary Americans. Just ask the tobacco company CEOs whose campaign donations he handed out on the floor of the House of Representatives—which is supposed to be the Peoples House, not the smokers\ lounge. Or ask the bankers who played Russian roulette with our homes and jobs, who got out their checkbooks as he and his fellow Republicans held a special meeting with them this summer promising to block any efforts to hold Wall Street accountable. We need a Speaker whose voice is our voice, wholl spend less time working on his tan and more time working on the problems of middle class Americans. \\Boehner and Rove\- After the Iraq War went south and the economy went under, most of us thought we''d never hear again from Karl Rove, the architect of the Bush revolution.

C05760526	sullivanij@state.gov B6 Thanks for all your hard work on this difficult speech to get it as right as possible. Here are a few comments and questions: We need to work in reference and quotes from POTUS Nobel speech near the top. I haven't read it yet so not sure what's most appriopriate. Since the speech alluded to some of the same ground, should we be explicit in asserting that this speech further clarifies/expands/explains what this Admin means by human rights? The points about us not being perfect and the existence of evil in the POTUS speech should be woven in more here too. For example, in discussion on p.7 about Japanese internment, etc. In the section about supporting individual defenders, should mention that we did that thru State Dept ceremony honoring brave women and applaud others like Vital Voices and RFK memorial who do same. Tell story about how I was asked to mention the name of a Guatemala activist in my sppech to the parliament there because the attention might literally save her life. Look forward to further discussion later today.

C05771197	H: Pat Lang's view of the resumed talks. Sid .\IsraePaestinialpeace talks expected to resume in Se4zitember\ Washst \The Middle East peace process resumed in May, after a hiatus of 19 months, but it stalled again over the terms of moving from indirect talks, mediated by U.S. envoy George Mitchell, to direct negotiations. .israel insists it is ready for direct talks, provided there are no preconditions. The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions. Resolving the snag over terms is crucial, diplomats say.\ Washpost The former NY Times reporter Judy Miller likes to address me as \gloomy gus\ or some such thing when I encounter her. Well, stand by for some more gloom. The second Camp David talks failed because Dennis Ross and company placed the Palestinian delegation in a position in which a \solution\ was demanded and expected by the Americans and Israelis on the basis of bargaining during the negotiations themselves. This seemed reasonable at the time to the US and Israeli negotiators. After all, is this not what one does? Should not the outcome be the product of the dialectic of argument and persuasion? Arabs generally think not. They tend to believe that negotiations are for the purpose of of arranging the details of outcomes that are understood in advance of the conference itself. For them, anything else is an attempt to win concessions through trickery. \The Palestinians are ready provided there is a clear agenda. Israel says an agenda means preconditions.\ Hello! What kind of nonsense is this? Have we learned nothing? And then, there is the \little\ matter of the non-participation of Hamas. Does the Obama Administration really think that this 600 pound gorilla can be ignored? Is this some sort of scheme on the part of Natanyahu, and \the boys\ to discredit Abbas so that an isolated Hamas can be attacked and destroyed later? Realism in diplomacy is a desirable thing. George Mitchell used to be smarter than this. His staff should be advising him not to do this. Failure will be catastrophic. All the players should be engaged, and they are not. The outcome should be known in advance and it is not. This is both childish and destructive. pl http://www.washiLigtorsost. cortilwp-dyn/contentiarticie;2010/0811 9/AR201 0081 907203 htrni

C05769639	John Ryan; Susan Mcnamara; Corrine Ebeling; Delano, Omorinsola; Claps, Boys home closing, but numbers don't tell full story By Burt Constable I Daily Herald Columnist Published: 6/3/2010 12:01 AM When the goal is turning around lives of young abused and neglected boys, filling out the scoresheet is more complicated than simply marking wins or losses. For the past 15 years, Ann G. Deuel has lived in Arlington Heights, but her heart has resided in Jamal Place, a three-story graystone at 1335 S. California Ave. in the North Lawndale neighborhood of Chicago. As a founder and executive director of Jamal Place, Deuel can tell countless stories about the boys, ages 11 to 17, who have spent time in the group home and about the army of suburbanites from St. Charles, Naperville, Lake Zurich and Lisle who have volunteered, donated and served on the board to help those kids. Lots of people in that field have good things to say about Deuel and Jamal Place. But when the new fiscal year begins on July 1, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services will not renew its contract with Jamal Place, forcing those kids to go to other facilities. \To shut us down and deny kids this opportunity is unconscionable,\ says Deuel, as she takes a deep breath and dabs at her eyes in an attempt to keep her emotions in check. She and her staff operated last year through a $1,041,000 contract with DCFS to provide a group home for 10 wards of the state. They've carved out a wonderful reputation in 15 years, so what happened? The easy answer is that DCFS put the group home under a new performance-based contracting system that determined Jamal Place fell short of benchmarks for keeping kids from running away, requiring hospitalization or ending up in juvenile detention. \Taxpayers expect and deserve positive results in the children we serve,\ says DCFS spokesman Kendall Marlowe. Jamal Place simply didn't measure up in the areas the state measures. Because Illinois has trimmed the number of wards of the state from a high of 52,000 in 1997 to only 15,500, a much higher percentage of those kids have mental illnesses, substance abuse or other problems. Since the state measures an agency's performance by days that the kids are physically present in the home, Jamal Place, with its small population, got bad marks when a child was hospitalized for a mental-health issue or detained by a judge. \We did what was clinically advisable for these children and we got dinged for it,\ says Brian Barclay, assistant executive director of Jamal Place. \We did what was in kids best interest.\ There is no consideration given for \incremental improvements in youth behavior, which occur as trusting relationships develop,\ Deuel notes. \I wish they could find a way to measure the individual aspects.\ When compared with similar facilities, Jamal Place graded lower, Marlowe says, adding that it \isnt a happy day\ when the state ends an agreement with a facility that has \good people\ and has done \good work\ in the past. He says DCFS did renew a contract with Deuel for a different transitional living facility that serves an older population. One of Jamal Place's \unfavorable\ outcomes involves a kid who already had a criminal record when he came to the group home at age 14. Now 17, he says he ended up in juvenile court after he made a mistake by hanging with the wrong people on the day when he stole a woman's purse. \Ive got a good relationship with the staff and residents. We did things as a family,\ says the teen, who now is living with a grandmother. \I love my grandmother, but Id rather be at Jamal Place. Im trying to do everything in my power to get back to Jamal Place.\ Intangibles arent part of the bureaucratic process. There isnt a place on an evaluation form to give credit to Deuel and her staff for leading the effort that closed a local \crack house.\ Theres no way to measure the improvements in a former resident that led him for the first time to sign \love\ before his name on the Mothers Day card he sent Deuel this year. Theres no scoresheet for the local gang leader who stopped preying on Jamal kids when he was confronted by Deuel and recognized her as the woman who gave him a Christmas present a few years earlier. The interview for this story is interrupted when that man calls Deuel, who is helping him find a legitimate job. \It is enormously frustrating to me that the attachment the boys develop with our staff members is not a 'measurable' outcome,\ Deuel says. \These are our children. Long after DCFS is done with these kids, our door is still open.\ Last weekend, many former residents came back to explain how Jamal Place helped them. On June 26, Jamal Place will celebrate its 15th anniversary with a picnic and walkathon in Douglas Park, across the street from the home. Deuel and her staff are hoping DCFS finds a way to give them more time, another year to continue its mission. \I've always maintained that God won't let us fail,\ says Deuel. \For 15 years, that's been the case, and now we've got this challenge.\

C05771224	Americas Faltering Search for Peace in the Middle East: Openings for Others? Remarks to staff of the Royal Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, separately, to members of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs Ambassador Chas W. Freeman, Jr. (USFS, Ret.) 1 September 2010, Oslo, Norway You have asked me to speak to current American policies in the Middle East, with an emphasis on the prospects for peace in the Holy Land. You have further suggested that I touch on the relationship of the Gulf Arabs, especially Saudi Arabia, to this. It is both an honor and a challenge to address this subject in this capital / at this ministry. The declaration of principles worked out in Oslo seventeen years ago was the last direct negotiation between Israelis and Palestinian Arabs to reach consequential, positive results. The Oslo accords were a real step toward peace, not another deceptive pseudo-event in an endlessly unproductive, so-called \peace process.\ And if that one step forward in Oslo in 1993 was followed by several steps backwards, there is a great deal to be learned from how and why that happened. There can be no doubt about the importance of todays topic. The ongoing conflict in the Holy Land increasingly disturbs the worlds conscience as well as its tranquility. The Israel-Palestine issue began as a struggle in the context of European colonialism. In the post-colonial era, tension between Israelis and the Palestinians they dispossessed became, by degrees, the principal source of radicalization and instability in the Arab East and then the Arab world as a whole. It stimulated escalating terrorism against Israelis at home and their allies abroad. Since the end of the Cold War, the interaction between Israel and its captive Palestinian population has emerged as the fountainhead of global strife. It is increasingly difficult to distinguish this strife from a war of religions or a conflict of civilizations. For better or ill, my own country, the United States has played and continues to play the key international part in this contest. American policies, more than those of any other external actor, have the capacity to stoke or stifle the hatreds in the Middle East and to spread or reverse their infection of the wider world. American policies and actions in the Middle East thus affect much more than that region. Yet, as I will argue, the United States has been obsessed with process rather than substance. It has failed to involve parties who are essential to peace. It has acted on Israels behalf to preempt rather than enlist international and regional support for peace. It has defined the issues in ways that preclude rather than promote progress. Its concept of a \peace process\ has therefore become the handmaiden of Israeli expansionism rather than a driver for peace. There are alternatives to tomorrows diplomatic peace pageant on the Potomac. And, as Norway has shown, there is a role for powers other than America in crafting peace in the Holy Land. Over thirty years ago, at Camp David, Jimmy Carter pushed Israel through the door to peace that Egypts Anwar Sadat had opened. Twenty years ago, the first Bush administration pressed Israel to the negotiating table with Palestinian leaders, setting the stage for their clandestine meetings in Oslo. The capacity of the United States to rally other governments behind a cause that it espouses may have atrophied, but American power remains far greater than that of any other nation. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East. For more than four decades, Israel has been able to rely on aid from the United States to dominate its region militarily and to sustain its economic prosperity. It has counted on its leverage in American politics to block the application of international law and to protect itself from the political repercussions of its policies and actions. Unquestioning American support has enabled Israel to put the seizure of ever more land ahead of the achievement of a modus vivendi with the Palestinians or other Arabs. Neither violent resistance from the dispossessed nor objections from abroad have brought successive Israeli governments to question, let alone alter the priority they assign to land over peace. Ironically, Palestinians too have developed a dependency relationship with America. This has locked them into a political framework over which Israel exercises decisive influence. They have been powerless to end occupation, pogroms, ethnic cleansing, and other humiliations by Jewish soldiers and settlers. Nor have they been able to prevent their progressive confinement in checkpoint-encircled ghettos on the West Bank and the great open-air prison of Gaza. Despite this appalling record of failure, the American monopoly on the management of the search for peace in Palestine remains unchallenged. Since the end of the Cold War, Russia — once a contender for countervailing influence in the region — has lapsed into impotence. The former colonial powers of the European Union, having earlier laid the basis for conflict in the region, have largely sat on their hands while ringing them, content to let America take the lead. China, India, and other Asian powers have prudently kept their political and military distance. In the region itself, Iran has postured and exploited the Palestinian cause without doing anything to advance it. Until recently, Turkey remained aloof. On rare occasions, as in the case of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Arabs have backed their verbal opposition to Israel with action. Egypt and Jordan have settled into an unpopular coexistence with Israel that is now sustained only by U.S. subventions. Saudi Arabia has twice taken the initiative to offer Israel diplomatic concessions if it were to conclude arrangements for peaceful coexistence with the Palestinians. But, overall, Arab governments have earned the contempt of the Palestinians and their own people for their lack of serious engagement. For the most part, Arab leaders have timorously demanded that America solve the Israel-Palestine problem for them, while obsequiously courting American protection against Israel, each other, Iran, and — in some cases — their own increasingly frustrated and angry subjects and citizens. Islam charges rulers with the duty to defend the faithful and to uphold justice. It demands that they embody righteousness. The resentment of mostly Muslim Arabs at their governing elites failure to meet these standards generates sympathy for terrorism directed not just at Israel but at both the United States and Arab governments associated with it. The perpetrators of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States saw it in part as reprisal for American complicity in Israeli cruelties to Palestinians and other Arabs. They justified it as a strike against Washingtons protection of Arab governments willing to overlook American contributions to Muslim suffering. Washingtons response to the attack included suspending its efforts to make peace in the Holy Land as well as invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq. All three actions inadvertently strengthened the terrorist case for further attacks on America and its allies. The armed struggle between Americans and Muslim radicals has already spilled over to Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and other countries. Authoritative voices in Israel now call for adding Iran to the list of countries at war with America. They are echoed by Zionist and neo-conservative spokesmen in the United States, The widening involvement of Americans in combat in Muslim lands has inflamed anti-American passions and catalyzed a metastasis of terrorism. It has caused a growing majority of the worlds 1.6 billion Muslims to see the United States as a menace to their faith, their way of life, their homelands, and their personal security. American populists and European xenophobes have meanwhile undercut liberal and centrist Muslim arguments against the intolerance that empowers terrorism by equating terrorism and its extremist advocates with Islam and its followers. The current outburst of bigoted demagoguery over the construction of an Islamic cultural center and mosque in New York is merely the most recent illustration of this. It suggests that the blatant racism and Islamophobia of contemporary Israeli politics is contagious. It rules out the global alliances against religious extremists that are essential to encompass their political defeat. President Obamas inability to break this pattern must be an enormous personal disappointment to him. He came into office committed to crafting a new relationship with the Arab and Muslim worlds. His first interview with the international media was with Arab satellite television. He reached out publicly and privately to Iran. He addressed the Turkish parliament with persuasive empathy. He traveled to a great center of Islamic learning in Cairo to deliver a remarkably eloquent message of conciliation to Muslims everywhere. He made it clear that he understood the centrality of injustices in the Holy Land to Muslim estrangement from the West. He promised a responsible withdrawal from Iraq and a judicious recrafting of strategy in Afghanistan. Few doubt Mr. Obamas sincerity. Yet none of his initiatives has led to policy change anyone can detect, let alone believe in It is not for me to analyze or explain the wide gaps between rhetoric and achievement in the Obama Administrations stewardship of so many aspects of my countrys affairs. American voters will render their first formal verdict on this two months from tomorrow, on the 2nd of November. The situation in the Holy Land, Iraq, Afghanistan, and adjacent areas is only part of what they will consider as they do so. But I do think it worthwhile briefly to examine some of the changes in the situation that ensure that many policies that once helped us to get by in the Middle East will no longer do this. Let me begin with the \peace process,\ a hardy perennial of Americas diplomatic repertoire that the Obama Administration will put back on public display tomorrow. In the Cold War, the appearance of an earnest and \even- handed\ American search for peace in the Holy Land was the price of U.S. access and influence in the Middle East. It provided political cover for conservative Arab governments to set aside their anger at American backing of Israel so as to stand with America and the Western bloc against Soviet Communism. It kept American relations with Israel and the Arabs from becoming a zero-sum game. It mobilized domestic Jewish support for incumbent presidents. Of course, there hasnt been an American-led \peace process\ in the Middle East for at least a decade. Still the conceit of a \peace process\ became an essential political convenience for all concerned. No one could bear to admit that the \peace process\ had expired. It therefore lived on in phantom form. Even when there was no \peace process,\ the possibility of resurrecting one provided hope to the gullible, cover to the guileful, beguilement for the press, an excuse for doing nothing to those gaining from the status quo, and — last but far from least — lifetime employment for career \peace processors.\ The perpetual processing of peace without the requirement to produce it has been especially appreciated by Israeli leaders. It has enabled them to behave like magicians, riveting foreign attention on meaningless distractions as they systematically removed Palestinians from their homes, settled half a million or more Jews in newly vacated areas of the occupied territories, and annexed a widening swath of land to a Jerusalem they insist belongs only to Israel. Palestinian leaders with legitimacy problems have also had reason to collaborate in the search for a \peace process.\ Its not just that there has been no obviously better way to end their peoples suffering. Playing \peace process\ charades justifies the international patronage and Israeli backing these leaders need to retain their status in the occupied territories. It ensures that they have media access and high-level visiting rights in Washington. Meanwhile, for American leaders, engagement in some sort of Middle East \peace process\ has been essential to credibility in the Arab and Islamic worlds, as well as with the ever-generous American Jewish community. Polls show that most American Jews are impatient for peace. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they are eager to believe in the willingness of the government of Israel to trade land for it. Previous \peace processes\ have exploited all these impulses. In practice, however, these diplomatic distractions have served to obscure Israeli actions and evasions that were more often prejudicial to peace than helpful in achieving it. Behind all the blather, the rumble of bulldozers has never stopped. Given this history, it has taken a year and a half of relentless effort by U.S. Special Envoy George Mitchell to persuade the parties even to meet directly to talk about talks as they first did here in Oslo, seventeen years ago. When the curtain goes up on the diplomatic show in Washington tomorrow, will the players put on a different skit? There are many reasons to doubt that they will. One is that the Obama administration has engaged the same aging impresarios who staged all the previously failed \peace processes\ to produce and direct this one with no agreed script. The last time these guys staged such an ill- prepared meeting, at Camp David in 2000, it cost both heads of delegation, Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat, their political authority. It led not to peace but to escalating violence. The parties are showing up this time to minimize President Obamas political embarrassment in advance of midterm elections in the United States, not to address his agenda — still less to address each others agendas. These are indeed difficulties. But the problems with this latest — and possibly final — iteration of the perpetually ineffectual \peace process\ are more fundamental. The Likud Party charter flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan River and stipulates that: \The Palestinians can run their lives freely in the framework of self-rule, but not as an independent and sovereign state.\ This Israeli government is committed to that charter as well as to the Jewish holy war for land in Palestine. It has no interest in trading land it covets for a peace that might thwart further territorial expansion. It considers itself unbound by the applicable UN resolutions, agreements from past peace talks, the \Roadmap,\ or the premise of the \two-state solution.\ The Palestinians are desperate for the dignity and security that only the end of the Israeli occupation can provide. But the authority of Palestinian negotiators to negotiate rests on their recognition by Israel and the United States, not on their standing in the occupied territories, Gaza, or the Palestinian diaspora. Fatah is the ruling faction in part of Palestine. Its authority to govern was repudiated by voters in the last Palestinian elections. The Mahmoud Abbas administration retains power by grace of the Israeli occupation authorities and the United States, which prefer it to the government empowered by the Palestinian people at the polls. Mr. Abbass constitutional term of office has long since expired. He presides over a parliament whose most influential members are locked up in Israeli jails. It is not clear for whom he, his faction, or his administration can now speak. So the talks that begin tomorrow promise to be a case of the disinterested going through the motions of negotiating with the mandate-less. The parties to these talks seek to mollify an America that has severely lessened international credibility. The United States government had to borrow the modest reputations for objectivity of others — the EU, Russia, and the UN — to be able to convene this discussion. It will be held under the auspices of an American president who was publicly humiliated by Israels prime minister on the issue that is at the center of the Israel-Palestine dispute — Israels continuing seizure and colonization of Arab land. Vague promises of a Palestinian state within a year now waft through the air. But the \peace process\ has always sneered at deadlines, even much, much firmer ones. A more definitive promise of an independent Palestine within a year was made at Annapolis three years ago. Analogous promises of Palestinian self-determination have preceded or resulted from previous meetings over the decades, beginning with the Camp David accords of 1979. Many in this audience will recall the five-year deadline fixed at Oslo. The talks about talks that begin tomorrow can yield concrete results only if the international community is prepared this time to insist on the one-year deadline put forward for recognizing a Palestinian state. Even then there will be no peace unless long-neglected issues are addressed. Peace is a pattern of stability acceptable to those with the capacity to disturb it by violence. It is almost impossible to impose. It cannot become a reality, still less be sustained, if those who must accept it are excluded from it. This reality directs our attention to who is not at this gathering in Washington and what must be done to remedy the problems these absences create. Obviously, the party that won the democratically expressed mandate of the Palestinian people to represent them — Hamas — is not there. Yet there can be no peace without its buy-in. Egypt and Jordan have been invited as observers. Yet they have nothing to add to the separate peace agreements each long ago made with Israel. (Both these agreements were explicitly premised on grudging Israeli undertakings to accept Palestinian self-determination. The Jewish state quickly finessed both.) Activists from the Jewish diaspora disproportionately staff the American delegation. A failure to reconcile either American Jews or the Palestine diaspora to peace would doom any accord. But the Palestinian diaspora will be represented in Washington only in tenuous theory, not in fact. Other Arabs, including the Arab League and the author of its peace initiative, Saudi Arabia, will not be at the talks tomorrow. The reasons for this are both simple and complex. At one level they reflect both a conviction that this latest installment of the \peace process\ is just another in a long series of public entertainments for the American electorate and also a lack of confidence in the authenticity of the Palestinian delegation. At another level, they result from the way the United States has defined the problems to be solved and the indifference to Arab interests and views this definition evidences. Then too, they reflect disconnects in political culture and negotiating style between Israelis, Arabs, and Americans. To begin with, neither Israel nor the conveners of this proposed new \peace process\ have officially acknowledged or responded to the Arab peace initiative of 2002. This offered normalization of relations with the Jewish state, should Israel make peace with the Palestinians. Instead, the United States and the Quartet have seemed to pocket the Arab offer, ignore its precondition that Israelis come to terms with Palestinians, and gone on to levy new demands. In this connection, making Arab recognition of Israels \right to exist\ the central purpose of the \peace process\ offends Arabs on many levels. In framing the issue this way, Israel and the United States appear to be asking for something well beyond pragmatic accommodation of the reality of a Jewish state in the Middle East. To the Arabs, Americans now seem to be insisting on Arab endorsement of the idea of the state of Israel, the means by which that state was established, and the manner in which it has comported itself. Must Arabs really embrace Zionism before Israel can cease expansion and accept peace? Arabs and Muslims familiar with European history can accept that European anti-Semitism justified the establishment of a homeland for traumatized European Jews. But asking them even implicitly to agree that the forcible eviction of Palestinian Arabs was a morally appropriate means to this end is both a nonstarter and seriously off-putting. So is asking them to affirm that resistance to such displacement was and is sinful. Similarly, the Arabs see the demand that they recognize a Jewish state with no fixed borders as a clever attempt to extract their endorsement of Israels unilateral expansion at Palestinian expense. The lack of appeal in this approach has been compounded by a longstanding American habit of treating Arab concerns about Israel as a form of anti-Semitism and tuning them out. Instead of hearing out and addressing Arab views, U.S. peace processors have repeatedly focused on soliciting Arab acts of kindness toward Israel. They argue that gestures of acceptance can help Israelis overcome their Holocaust-inspired political neuroses and take risks for peace. Each time this notion of Arab diplomacy as psychotherapy for Israelis has been trotted out, it has been met with incredulity. To most in the region, it encapsulates the contrast between Washingtons sympathy and solicitude for Israelis and its condescendingly exploitative view of Arabs. Some see it as a barely disguised appeal for a policy of appeasement of Israel. Still others suspect an attempt to construct a \peace process\ in which Arabs begin to supply Israel with gifts of carrots so that Americans can continue to avoid applying sticks to it. The effort to encourage Arab generosity as an offset to American political pusillanimity vis-a-vis Israel is ludicrously unpersuasive. It has failed so many times that it should be obvious that it will not work. Yet it was a central element of George Mitchells mandate for \peace process\ diplomacy. And it appears to have resurfaced as part of the proposed follow-up to tomorrows meeting between the parties in Washington. It should be no puzzle why the Saudis and other Arabs could not be persuaded to join this gathering. As a last thought before turning to what must be done, let me make a quick comment on a relevant cultural factor. Arabic has two quite different words that are both translated as \negotiation,\ making a distinction that doesnt exist in either English or Hebrew. One word, \musaawama,\ refers to the no-holds-barred bargaining process that takes place in bazaars between strangers who may never see each other again and who therefore feel no obligation not to scam each other. Another, \mufaawadhat,\ describes the dignified formal discussions about matters of honor and high principle that take place on a basis of mutual respect and equality between statesmen who seek a continuing relationship. Egyptian President Anwar Sadats travel to Jerusalem was a grand act of statesmanship to initiate a process of mufaawadhat — relationship-building between leaders and their polities. So was the Arab peace initiative of 2002. It called for a response in kind. The West muttered approvingly but did not act. After a while, Israel responded with intermittent, somewhat oblique suggestions of willingness to haggle over terms. But an offer to bicker over the terms on which a grand gesture has been granted is, not surprisingly, seen as insultingly unresponsive. I cite this not to suggest that non-Arabs should adopt Arabic canons of thought, but to make a point about diplomatic effectiveness. To move a negotiating partner in a desired direction, one must understand how that partner understands things and help him to see a way forward that will bring him to an end he has been persuaded to want. One of the reasons we cant seem to move things as we desire in the Middle East is that we dont make much effort to understand how others reason and how they rank their interests. In the case of the Israel-Palestine conundrum, we Americans are long on empathy and expertise about Israel and very, very short on these for the various Arab parties. The essential militarism of U.S. policies in the Middle East adds to our difficulties. We have become skilled at killing Arabs. We have forgotten how to listen to them or persuade them. I am not myself an \Arabist,\ but I am old enough to remember when there were more than a few such people in the American diplomatic service. These were officers who had devoted themselves to the cultivation of understanding and empathy with Arab leaders so as to be able to convince these leaders that it was in their own interest to do things we saw as in our interest. If we still have such people, we are hiding them well; we are certainly not applying their skills in our Middle East diplomacy. This brings me to a few thoughts about the Western and Arab interests at stake in the Holy Land and their implications for what must be done. In foreign affairs, interests are the measure of all things. My assumption is that Americans and Norwegians, indeed Europeans in general, share common interests that require peace in the Holy Land. To my mind, these interests include - but are, of course, not limited to — gaining security and acceptance for a democratic state of Israel; eliminating the gross injustices and daily humiliations that foster Arab terrorism against Israel and its foreign allies and supporters, as well as friendly Arab regimes; and reversing the global spread of religious strife and prejudice, including, very likely, a revival of anti-Semitism in the West if current trends are not arrested. None of these aspirations can be fulfilled without an end to the Israeli occupation and freedom for Palestinians. Arab states, like Saudi Arabia, also have compelling reasons to want relief from occupation as well as self-determination for Palestinians. They may not be concerned to preserve Israels democracy, as we are, but they share an urgent interest in ending the radicalization of their own populations, curbing the spread of Islamist terrorism, and eliminating the tensions with the West that the conflict in the Holy Land fuels. These are the concerns that have driven them to propose peace, as they very clearly did eight years ago. For related reasons, Saudi Arabias King Abdullah has made inter-faith dialogue and the promotion of religious tolerance a main focus of his domestic and international policy. As the custodian of two of Islams three sacred places of pilgrimage — Mecca and Medina — Saudi Arabia has long transcended its own notorious religious narrow-mindedness to hold the holy places in its charge open to Muslims of all sects and persuasions. This experience, joined with Islamic piety, reinforces a Saudi insistence on the exemption of religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem from political interference or manipulation. The Ottoman Turks were careful to ensure freedom of access for worship to adherents of the three Abrahamic faiths when they administered the city. It is an interest that Jews, Christians, and Muslims share. There is, in short, far greater congruity between Western and Arab interests affecting the Israel-Palestine dispute than is generally recognized. This can be the basis for creative diplomacy. The fact that this has not occurred reflects pathologies of political life in the United States that paralyze the American diplomatic imagination. Tomorrows meeting may well demonstrate that, the election of Barack Obama notwithstanding, the United States is still unfit to manage the achievement of peace between Israel and the Arabs. If so, it is in the American interest as well as everyone elses that others become the path-breakers, enlisting the United States as best they can in support of what they achieve, but not expecting America to overcome its incapacity to lead. Here, I think, there is a lesson to be drawn from the Norwegian experience in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration was happy to organize the public relations for the Oslo accords but did not take ownership of them. It did little to protect them from subversion and overthrow, and nothing to insist on their implementation. Only a peace process that is protected from Israels ability to manipulate American politics can succeed. This brings me to how Europeans and Arabs might work together to realize the objectives both share with most Americans: establishing internationally recognized borders for Israel, securing freedom for the Palestinians, and ending the stimulus to terrorism in the region and beyond it that strife in the Holy Land entails. I have only four suggestions to present today. I expect that more ideas will emerge from the discussion period. A serious effort to cooperate with the Arabs of the sort that Norway is uniquely capable of contriving could lead to the development of still more options for joint or parallel action on behalf of peace. Now to my suggestions, presented in ascending order of difficulty, from the least to the most controversial. First, get behind the Arab peace initiative. Saudi Arab culture frowns on self-promotion and the Kingdom is less gifted than most at public diplomacy. Political factors inhibit official Arab access to the Israeli press. The Israeli media have published some — mostly dismissive — commentary on the Arab peace initiative but left most Israelis ignorant of its contents and unfamiliar with its text. Why not buy space in the Israeli media to give Israelis a chance to read the Arab League declaration and consider the opportunities it presents? I suspect the Saudis, as well as other members of the Arab League, would consider it constructive for an outside party to do this. It might facilitate other sorts of cooperation with them in which European capabilities can also compensate for Arab reticence. The Turks and other non-Arab Muslims should be brought in as full participants in any such efforts. This wouldnt be bad for Europes relations with both. By the way, given the U.S. medias notorious one-sidedness and American ignorance about the Arab peace plan, a well-targeted advertising campaign in the United States might not be a bad idea either. Second, help create a Palestinian partner for peace. There can be no peace with Israel unless there are officials who are empowered by the Palestinian people to negotiate and ratify it. Israel has worked hard to divide the Palestinians so as to consolidate its conquest of their homeland. Saudi Arabia has several times sought to create a Palestinian peace partner for Israel by bringing Fatah, Hamas, and other factions together. On each occasion, Israel, with U.S. support, has acted to preclude this. Active organization of non-American Western support for diplomacy aimed at restoring a unity government to the Palestinian Authority could make a big difference. The Obama Administration would be under strong domestic political pressure to join Israel in blocking a joint European-Arab effort to accomplish this. Under some circumstances, however, it might welcome being put to this test. Third, reaffirm and enforce international law. The UN Security Council is charged with enforcing the rule of law internationally. In the case of the Middle East, however, the Councils position at the apex of the international system has served to erode and subvert the ideal of a rule-bound international order. Almost forty American vetoes have prevented the application to the Israeli occupying authorities of the Geneva Conventions, the Nuremberg precedents, human rights conventions, and relevant Security Council directives. American diplomacy on behalf of the Jewish state has silenced the collective voice of the international community as Israel has illegally colonized and annexed broad swaths of occupied territory, administered collective punishment to a captive people, assassinated their political leaders, massacred civilians, barred UN investigators, defied mandatory Security Council resolutions, and otherwise engaged in scofflaw behavior, usually with only the flimsiest of legally irrelevant excuses. If ethnic cleansing, settlement activity, and the like are not just \unhelpful\ but illegal, the international community should find a way to say so, even if the UN Security Council cannot. Otherwise, the most valuable legacy of Atlantic civilization - its vision of the rule of law — will be lost. When one side to a dispute is routinely exempted from principles, all exempt themselves, and the law of the jungle prevails. The international community needs collectively to affirm that Israel, both as occupier and as regional military hegemon, is legally accountable internationally for its actions. If the UN General Assembly cannot \unite for peace\ to do what an incapacitated Security Council cannot, member states should not shrink from working in conference outside the UN framework. All sides in the murder and mayhem in the Holy Land and beyond need to understand that they are not above the law. If this message is firmly delivered and enforced, there will be a better chance for peace. Fourth, set a deadline linked to an ultimatum. Accept that the United States will frustrate any attempt by the UN Security Council to address the continuing impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Organize a global conference outside the UN system to coordinate a decision to inform the parties to the dispute that if they cannot reach agreement in a year, one of two solutions will be imposed. Schedule a follow-up conference for a year later. The second conference would consider whether to recommend universal recognition of a Palestinian state in the area beyond Israels 1967 borders or recognition of Israels achievement of de jure as well as de facto sovereignty throughout Palestine (requiring Israel to grant all governed by it citizenship and equal rights at pain of international sanctions, boycott, and disinvestment). Either formula would force the parties to make a serious effort to strike a deal or to face the consequences of their recalcitrance. Either formula could be implemented directly by the states members of the international community. Admittedly, any serious deadline would provoke a political crisis in Israel and lead to diplomatic confrontation with the United States as well as Israel, despite the Obama Administration itself having proclaimed a one- year deadline in order to entice the Palestinians to tomorrows talks. Yet both Israel and the United States would benefit immensely from peace with the Palestinians. Time is running out. The two-state solution may already have been overtaken by Israeli land grabs and settlement activity. Another cycle of violence is likely in the offing. If so, it will not be local or regional, but global in its reach. Israels actions are delegitimizing and isolating it even as they multiply the numbers of those in the region and beyond who are determined to destroy it. Palestinian suffering is a reproach to all humanity that posturing alone cannot begin to alleviate. It has become a cancer on the Islamic body politic. It is infecting every extremity of the globe with the rage against injustice that incites terrorism. It is time to try new approaches. That is why the question of whether there is a basis for expanded diplomatic cooperation between Europeans and Arabs is such a timely one. And it is why I was pleased as well as honored to have been asked to set the stage for a discussion of this issue.

C05767727	• oClose Window • Print this page From The Sunday Times February 28, 2010 Gordon Brown on course to win election David Smith and Jonathan Oliver GORDON BROWN is on course to remain prime minister after the general election as a new Sunday Times poll reveals that Labour is now just two points behind the Tories. The YouGov survey places David Camerons Conservatives on 37%, as against 35% for Labour — the closest gap between the parties in more than two years. It means Labour is heading for a total of 317 seats, nine short of an overall majority, with the Tories languishing on a total of just 263 MPs. Such an outcome would mean Brown could stay in office and deny Cameron the keys to No 10. The poll result presents the Conservative leader with one of the greatest challenges of his leadership today as he makes the keynote speech to his partys spring forum. In an interview with The Sunday Times, Cameron defied his right-wing critics who believe the partys modernisation has gone too far. He said: \Some people say to me, 'Play things safe; try to win by default — the government is in a mess.' I say, 'No. This is the Conservative party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change'.\ With the expected May 6 election now just over two months away, Cameron will seek to reconnect with voters through a series of pledges, including a plan to restore discipline in schools. In an echo of the speech that won him the Tory leadership in 2005, he will address the Brighton conference without notes. \This is very, very clear,\ he said. \I've made my choice. There is no going back. This election is about change and we will be offering change.\ Cameron insisted he was unconcerned about the collapse in Tory support. \The polls move around a lot,\ he said. \The voters tell us that they want change. They want to know the Conservative party itself has changed.\ The narrowing of the Conservative lead has been dramatic and rapid. Until January the Tories held close to a 10-point lead. But a week ago a Sunday Times YouGov poll put the gap at six points, suggesting a hung parliament, with the Tories still on course to become the largest party. In the last election, in 2005, support for the parties generally held steady in the run-up to polling day. YouGov polling for The Sunday Times showed Labour leads of between two and five points from January through to the June election. Labours margin of victory was three points. In todays poll, Labour has risen two points on the previous week, from 33%, while the Conservatives have dropped two from 39%. The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 17%. The collapse in the Tory poll lead will put pressure on the pound in financial markets tomorrow by adding to fears that a hung parliament will mean insufficient action is taken to cut Britains budget deficit. The last time the gap between the two main parties came this close and the Tory support was so low was in autumn 2007. That was before Browns honeymoon ended with his failure to call a snap general election. The Conservatives went on to peak in May 2008 with a 26-point lead. Todays poll suggests recent claims about Browns tantrums and his intimidation of staff may have actually helped him. Just 28% of people believe the prime minister is a bully and 50% agree he has a \strong sense of right and wrong\. The survey disclosed growing concerns about Camerons elite background and lack of empathy with ordinary families. Just 25% think that Cameron understands problems faced by \people like me\, compared with 35% for Brown.

Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the most important and influential leaders of our time, whose five decades as Senator from Massachusetts helped to shape Americas history and chart our shared future. During our time in the White House, we were thankful for his fierce advocacy and support for universal health care and his work to provide health coverage to low-income children. Without his tireless efforts, America would not be as close to achieving health care reform as we are today.Continuing the legacy left by his older brothers, his lifelong pursuit of civil rights and justice for all moved America forward to form a more perfect union. But beyond his death, his legacy of public service will live on in millions of young people across our nation who now have the chance to serve through the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which will expand AmeriCorps and other youth service opportunities. He loved his country, his wife Vicki, and his incredible children and grandchildren. We are proud to have known him, worked alongside him, and called him our friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Massachusetts during this difficult time.

C05766717	Interesting observations from DecIan: Foster was a critical component in the talks apparently. However there is already speculation that PR may use this moment to try to come back early and resume position of FM given that the other investigations have been delayed pending the outcome of the police investigation. He went to London with his family yesterday to visit his wife, who is in a clinic there apparently. Empey still not on board apparently so the \community confidence\ round may be used to put pressure on him to do so. Our intervention on Thursday night/Friday morning was seen as a very important moment/catalyst. That, coupled with the jobs losses that day and the fact that the radio and tv phone-in lines and newspapers were full of commentary supporting what we said, seems to have made people realize, that they couldnt lose the moment.

C05761807	Sorry to flood your email, but I couldnt resist sending this to you from Ben Smith A year later, Hillary wins A year ago today, the final set of primaries made official the foregone conclusion that Barack Obama had won the primary, and Hillary Clinton lost it. Theres far too much going on today to dwell on an anniversary, but it does seem worth noting one particular piece of news in its light: On the central health care policy debate of the Democratic Primary -- which was, to be fair, conducted within a fairly narrow frame -- Obama appears to have conceded today to a Senate plan likely to more closely resemble Clintons. In a dense, careful letter to Ted Kennedy and Max Baucus, Obama offered his principles for a health care plan and conceded on a central point: He is now open to an individual mandate, which he campaigned against, and which is now being talked about by Senators of both parties with the buzzword \shared responsibility.\ Obama still backs a \hardship waiver\ for people unable to afford the mandate -- which is consistent with the core of his objection to the mandate. But what he cast as a principled difference of approach -- was the problem merely that people couldnt afford insurance? or something more? -- seems to have been conceded. Heres the relevant paragraph: I understand the Committees are moving towards a principle of shared responsibility -- making every American responsible for having health insurance coverage, and asking that employers share in the cost. I share the goal of ending lapses and gaps in coverage that make us less healthy and drive up everyones costs, and I am open to your ideas on shared responsibility. But I believe if we are going to make people responsible for owning health insurance, we must make health care affordable. If we do end up with a system where people are responsible for their own insurance, we need to provide a hardship waiver to exempt Americans who cannot afford it. In addition, while I believe that employers have a responsibility to support health insurance for their employees, small businesses face a number of special challenges in affording health benefits and should be exempted.

C05764934	Holbrookes Contributions on Af/Pak Holbrooke has assembled an unprecedented interagency team to carry out the work on Af/Pak — a whole-of-government team in DC and a reorganized and reenergized U.S. mission in Kabul. Holbrookes team is actually getting things done, including the implementation of more than 20 detailed action plans. Some examples of the work thus far: • The civilian surge in Afghanistan is on pace to meet targets by end of year. • Our approach to assistance in Afghanistan has changed dramatically, both through the consolidation of efforts under Tony Wayne and the review (and sometimes rejection) of assistance contracts. • • Holbrooke has opened and is actively pursuing R/R channels. • The swift and comprehensive U.S. response helped alleviate and reduce the impact of the Swat refugee crisis. • • The trilateral meetings have helped create conditions for progress on key cross-border issues. )11 • Holbrookes international diplomacy — in the Gulf, with China, with the cadre of other special representatives — has translated into funding and equipment commitments, more buy-in, and more patience. Holbrooke has been a key driver of (non-military) strategic innovation in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Here are some examples:Ill Defining a regional approach to Af/Pak (including trilateral summits) • The regional approach championed by Holbrooke became a central feature of the Reidel report; the trilats are a pure Holbrooke invention Afghanistan The clearest voice and thinker on swifter and more heavily resourced \Afghanization\ - primarily by standing up a sufficiently large and sufficiently capable ANSF — as the preferable alternative to adding more troops. • The Reidel report calls for training 134,000 army and 82,000 police over two years; Holbrooke is working through a strategy that would more than double those numbers and speed the pace of training. Such a strategy has to resolve significant obstacles, particularly with respect to the police. Framing and executing the U.S. approach to Afghan elections: • Developing a strategy — in partnership with the Afghan government and others — for pursuing reconciliation/reintegration. • The Reidel report discusses support for the Afghan governments efforts to reintegrate \non ideologically-committed\ insurgents who lay down their arms, renounce al Qaeda, and accept the Afghan Constitution. Holbrooke was key in developing this aspect of the report, and is now working through the next phases. Prioritizing a shift in emphasis on counternarcotics from eradication to interdiction • The Reidel report discusses the need for increased interdiction efforts — and the attendant need to support licit agriculture to shift livelihoods. Emphasizing and executing our engagement with Arab allies, China, and Turkey • The Reidel report speaks generally about engaging all those with a stake in the region. It does not lay out a specific diplomatic strategy or priority countries. • [NOTE: • This issue does not get extensive treatment in the Reidel report. Pakistan • The Reidel report does not speak in any detail to this issue. Responding decisively to the refugee crisis in Swat and Buner • Obviously, the Reidel report does not address this. The immediate response to the refugee crisis was Holbrookes team at its finest. Making the image of the United States in Pakistan as a critical strategic priority • The Reidel report focuses on strategic communications in Afghanistan. Holbrookes recent trip with Judith McHale is the latest in an ongoing effort to develop a strategic communications plan for Pakistan. Generally, Holbrooke, along with McDonough, has been the key mover on all things related to strategic communications in both Afghanistan and Pakistan; he has a good sense of what is missing and what is needed. Pursuing a major new energy initiative to address Pakistans economic troubles and boost support for the United States • The Reidel report mentions energy as a key sector where we should be encouraging foreign investment. 1.

C05770514	Below are points for the press on the plane. Ill have a hard copy printed: First major ministerial in Afghanistan since the 1970s. The very fact of it is a big deal. Context is important. This is not out of the blue, its not just a random gathering; its part of a systematic process: Karzais inauguration, announcement of the Presidents strategy, London conference, Peace Jirga, and now the Kabul conference. Increasing Afghan leadership and ownership: They are presenting a set of concrete programs on governance, service delivery, security transition, economic development, and reintegration. These programs are detailed; they are serious; and they reflect months of work and consultation. Increasing international alignment: The international community is coordinating with each other - through ISAF, Sedwill, de Mistura, etc. - and aligning its efforts with the Afghan programs and priorities being set forth at this conference. This is NOT a pledging conference. It is an opportunity to ensure we are effectively supporting Afghan government leadership and ownership Follow-through and accountability: In his inauguration, Karzai laid out a credible vision; in London, the Afghan government committed to developing and pursuing specific plans in a variety of areas; at Kabul, well be heavily focused on implementation. This is about mutual accountability for the pledges made and the programs set forth. July 2011: The presidents strategy reflects both urgency and resolve: increased resources and intensity in our efforts to take the fight to the enemy and to build Afghan capacity to effect a conditions-based transition; and a long-term civilian commitment to support Afghanistan long into the future. Clear strategy: Reverse the momentum of the Taliban; build the capacity of Afghan security forces; and as Afghans develop the capability to stabilize their country, we must draw down our combat presence and make a responsible transition to Afghan leadership. Clear desired end-state: An Afghan state that is willing and strong enough to ensure that global terrorists never again have safe haven within its borders; can withstand internal and external threats; and can continue to make long-term political and economic progress, all with sustainable levels of international support. Civ-mil cooperation: Unfortunate to lose General McChrystal, but maintained continuity with General Petraeus and we have only intensified our civ-mil engagement both in Kabul and Washington. Reconciliation: Stress that it is Afghan-led. Note red-lines.
C05772998	First, Happy New Year to Jen and Stern clan. Hope to talk soon about our way forward for 2010. I received the following email from Jairem Ramesh over the holidays.

Bruce got in touch offered to help Spanta put together an arrangement at NYU that might have a Brookings offshoot. Spanta said he needed to decide with Karzai whether in fact the timing was right for him to leave. He just got back in touch with Bruce saying hes decided to stay on a bit longer. That said, hes agreed to participate in some Track II regional work that Bruce has underway. All in all, it sounds as though this has ended up in the right place for now.

C05768506	(wanted to give you some brief observations from my trip to Lithuania. First of all, their friendship with the US and respect for you was much in evidence on all levels. Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted for me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (hes hoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for Eastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the President and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and, despite a tough economy, have done everything weve asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting with the Speaker and top women members of the parlnt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years. One of the women was at the Vienna W conf and said shes in politics today because of you. Another read about safe birthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more opportunities to work together. I came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude for our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies. The meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an important time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several years. We had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland W conf. (So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for future concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD ministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive response for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender institute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help. The Dutch minister who came said the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg. Lastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief was palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many of their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta foundation has been very active in advancing womens progress in Poland as well as working in other countries.
C05764353	I spoke to Ann and she sd that you always have the Trustee box to use in each House. She cannot hold a box for The Secretary of State use only not - bt can further discussions with KC on this She advises that we need to give advance notice - There are 4 seat in the Eisenhower that are complimentary and then 4 that would need to be purchased for nominal fee (seems like a really silly policy) The same for Opera and in the Symphony there are 12 all complimentary. I think if we begin to use the box on a regular basis we can work with them on the cost issues. This could be a lovely way to serve many special guests.

C05767349	Car bomb explodes in Northern Ireland Republican dissidents suspected after blast outside courthouse in Newry as evacuation was taking place • Buzz up! • Diqg it • Mark Tran • quardian.co.uk, Tuesday 23 February 2010 • Article history A car bomb exploded last night outside the courthouse in Newry, Northern Ireland, police said. There were no initial reports of any injuries in the blast. Police said the vehicle was abandoned at the front of the building in the Co Down town at around lOpm. Officers were in the process of evacuating the area when the car exploded. Suspicion is bound to fall on republican dissidents opposed to the peace process. The incident comes only days after a mortar bomb failed to detonate outside a police station in the nearby Co Armagh village of Keady. The chairman of the nationalist SDLP in Newry, Gary McKeown, condemned those responsible. \Lives could have been lost as a result of this bombing,\ he said. \It serves absolutely no purpose and does nothing for the community, or the cause of a united Ireland. If people want to advance their beliefs, they should enter the democratic process and debate with their political opponents, rather than resorting to violence. Planting bombs outside courthouses will achieve nothing.\ Earlier this month, police on both sides of the Irish border launched separate operations against dissident republicans. Police in Northern Ireland arrested two men and a woman in connection with the murder of Constable Stephen Carroll, the first PSNI officer killed by terrorists in the province. The Continuity IRA shot the 48-year-old policeman dead on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh, on 9 March last year. His murder came just 48 hours after the Real IRA killed two British soldiers outside the Massereene barracks in Antrim. In September police discovered a massive 600lb bomb in the south Armagh village of Forkhill. On Sunday, Republican Sinn Fein, political allies of the Continuity IRA, claimed masked undercover soldiers carried out surveillance on two housing estates in Lurgan, Co Armagh, in recent weeks. They claimed the men were scouting the areas in white civilian vans. Republican Sinn Fein said the soldiers belonged to the Special Reconnaissance Regiment. The alleged presence of SRR soldiers — formerly known as the 14th Intelligence Unit — is controversial because British troops are meant to have been pulled off the streets, especially in nationalist areas. Britain heading for hung parliament Guardian/ICM poll Tories might not win election outright, suggests new survey • Comments (259) • Buzz up! • Digq it • Julian Glover • quardian.co.uk, Monday 22 February 2010 18.30 GMT • Article history The Conservatives should no longer count on winning the election outright, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today. The new survey suggests Britain is on course for a hung parliament amid faltering public support for David Camerons party. The opposition have also lost ground on key policy issues, including the economy, and in particular may be losing their campaign against Labours so-called \death tax\. Labour leads the Tories by eight points as the party with the best policy on care for the elderly. The two parties are neck and neck on their ability to sort out the economic crisis, against a nine-point Tory lead when the question was last asked in August 2009. With no more than three months to go until polling day, the Conservatives have fallen to 37%, down three on last months Guardian/ICM poll and down two on another ICM poll earlier this month. The party has not fallen so low in an ICM poll since the tail end of the banking crisis, last falling to 37% in February 2008. As recently as last October the Tories hit 45% in an ICM poll and the party will be alarmed by this latest evidence that the race is tightening, which confirms the findings of some other recent polls. Meanwhile Labours support, at 30%, is eight points up on its absolute ICM bottom last May, and slightly above its average for the second part of last year. However, there is no sign of either a boost for the party following Gordon Browns Piers Morgan interview or a fall after this weekends reports about Brown bullying his staff. Labours support is up one point on the last Guardian/ICM poll and unchanged from the most recent ICM poll. Research began last Friday and most was carried out before the serialisation of Andrew Rawnsleys book in yesterdays Observer, which may have affected Labour support. Around a fifth of responses were collected on Sunday. Nick Cleggs hopes of a powerful place in a hung parliament are also boosted by todays poll, which puts the Liberal Democrats on 20%, unchanged from the most recent ICM and down one on last months Guardian poll. All this suggests that Labour and the Lib Dems are holding steady while the Conservatives lose some ground to smaller parties, which are on a total of 13%. Nationalists are on 5%, Ukip and the Greens on 3% each and the BNP on 2%. Estimates of what these shares would mean for the parties on polling day vary, but a 7% lead is at the margins of what the Tories think they need to win a majority. One academic calculation suggests the result would leave Labour only 25 seats behind the Tories in a hung parliament, although any improved Tory performance in marginal seats would offset that. • /CMResearch interviewed a random sample of 1,004 adults by telephone on 19-21 February 2010.

Sid B6 http://www.juancole.com/2012/12/benghazis-criticizes-consular.ht I Benghazis Deep Throat fingers Islamist Leaders for Attacks as State Dept Criticized on Consular Security Posted on 12/19/2012 by Juan The report saying that security was inadequate at the compound that the US had adopted as its ad hoc consulate in 13enghazio Libya dominates todays headlines. That conclusion is obvious. The \consulate\ was just a private residence taken over for this purpose by the US in the city, It was not constructed to be a US government building in a potentially hostile city. I met a person who worked there when I was in Benghazi in June, and she told me that it wasnt even clear if the consulate would be retained after the first of this year It was possibly temporary, depending on Congressional funding. (The Tea Party House hasnt been good on meeting requests for embassy security funds). The more interesting question than why ad hoc arrangements should have been made for a consulate during and after the Libyan revolution (the answer to which seems fairly obvious) is, who is responsible for the string of assassinations and acts of violence in the city, of which the RPG attack on the consulate on September 11 was only one? Benghazi, with a population of over one million in a country of 6.5 million, is Libyas second largest city and1/1 eas the epicenter of the revolution against the government of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011. On November 22, Benghazi police chief Farej Darssi was assassinated. In October a police colonel barely avoided death— his car was wired to explode, A Libyan intelligence officer was killed in September. A general was assassinated in August. Some of these figures had worked for Qaddafi but had defected to the revolution. Qaddafis security forces were responsible for the 1996 massacre of hardline fundamentalists at Abu Salim prison, and for making others just disappear, Likely the same shadowy cells that attacked the US consulate are behind the attacks on Benghazi police and army officers. There may have been a break in the case. Last Saturday, Benghazi security forces loyal to the elected government in Tripoli, captured a man they suspected of being involved with the groups behind the violence. And, he appears to have been willing to spill the beans. So lets call him the Libyan Deep Throat. Deep Throat is so knowledgeable about the conspiracies facing the city and so dangerous to those hatching them that the latter immediately attempted to spring him from jail. On Sunday morning, militants attacked the police facility next to the holding cell where the man is being detained. A policeman at that station died in a hail of bullets from the attackers, and they called for back-up. The police car that sped to the scene as ambushed and three policemen in it were killed. Still, the police stood their ground and fought off the assault, and they kept their valuable suspect in custody, with all his valuable testimony. Shortly after midnight, on Monday morning, small explosives were set off at the Garyounis police station in Benghazi, damaging a couple of automobiles but otherwise doing little damage. Then explosives were set off at al-Uruba police station, which also took sniper fire, but neither resulted in casualties.

The police became vigilant, and they apprehended a shady-looking man skulking around near the al- Hadaeg police station, finding him to have two rocket propelled grenades in his possession, which he was apparently intending to fire at the station. In other words, the capture of Libyan Deep Throat has set off a gang war on the police, who are being informed by bombings and shootings that they must let their informant go or risk their So what is Deep Throat saying? According to local journalist Mohamed Bujenah of the Libyan Herald, a senior figure in the Benghazi police told him that the informant had fingered as many as 7 prominent Muslim fundamentalist leaders in connection with these attacks, of whom the police named 6 explicitly: 1 Sufyan Ben Qumu, from the notoriously radical town of Derna, and a former prisoner at Guantanamo 2.Ahmad Bukatela, leader of the ,Thai& Militia 3.Muhammad al-Zahawi, head of the Ansar al-Sharia militia 4.Muhammad al-Gharabi, a leader of the Rafallala al-Sahati Militia 5.Ismail Sallabi, another leader of Rafallah al-Sahati 6.Salim .Nabous, head of the Zawiya Martyrs Brigade It is just a newspaper article. We dont know if the informant actually named these individuals or if he did so to escape torture, in which case we cant trust what he said. But if the allegations are true, there is collusion among several hardline militias in the city to create instability in hopes of taking it over. The new, elected, prime minister Ali Zeidan, has started asserting himself militarily. He closed the countrys southern borders against instability in the Sahel. He may well have some risky house cleaning to do in Benghazi. U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739848 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

C05764630	FYI: We will send today for your review and approval a demarche describing the circumstances in which the U.S. would walk out of speeches at the UN General Assembly and asking countries to join us in the walkout. Note that we are differing from past practice when we simply did not have anyone in the U.S. seat during speeches by certain countries. This year an appropriate-level individual will be behind the U.S. placard for all speeches and will remain unless these redlines are crossed. This demarche is going out to EU member state capitals, as well as Oslo, Reykjavik, Ottawa, Canberra, Wellington, Tokyo, Seoul, Buenos Aires, Bogota, San Jose, and Montevideo. USUN asks that our posts deliver the demarche in advance of an EU political directors meeting on this issue in New York Monday morning our time. The background portion of the cable, which discusses EU internal dynamics on this issue, is classified, but the unclassified talking points will come to you for your review.

C05771423	Maybe. And, of course, worth the effort. Without an effort, the two state solution is dead; if failed, on the other hand, also dead. Another idea, dont know if it can be made to work: How to introduce Israel entering the NPT and ending its nuclear ambiguity, which is its state policy, but which itself is the model for Iran now. Can this issue be used profitably in negotiations, a wild card, as it were? Can options be developed on whether it can, how it might work, potential effect on peace process? Israels nuclear ambiguity policy is certainly a big issue coming given Iran. See below from Haaretz today: • Home • Print Edition • Nt- - 3ws • Published 00:56 26.08.10 • Latest update 00:56 26.08.10 Interview / Why Israel should end its policy of nuclear ambiguity An interview with Avner Cohen, expert on nonproliferation issues and author of the forthcoming book \The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb.\ By Nia. tasha Mozwvava Tags: Israel news Avner Cohen is a senior fellow of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. He is the author of \Israel and the Bomb\ and the forthcoming \The Worst-Kept Secret: Israel's Bargain with the Bomb.\ Avner Cohen, you claim that the time has come for Israel to abandon its policy of nuclear ambiguity. Why now, and why would that be good for Israel? \Nuclear ambiguity is a cornerstone of Israeli strategic thinking. It was born many years ago, and sealed as part of a comprehensive deal with the United States in 1969. It was appropriate at the time, but today. in my opinion, it is not just anachronistic, but foolish and anti-democratic. Even in realpolitik terms, it is an 'own goal' for Israel. In my view, it undermines genuine Israeli interests, including the need to gain recognition and legitimacy and to be counted among the responsible states in this strategic field.\ Are you sure the pressure on Israel is so severe? If Israel is criticized over its nuclear program, its usually marginal. The brunt of the criticism is over its treatment of the Palestinians. • \Israel received tacit consent for its nuclear program from the Western world because it appeared to be a small, just state' surrounded by enemies, and the memory of the Holocaust was still fresh. Israel's image was different then. \In the long term, the more Israel appears to reject peace and to be the one that opposes a two-state solution, the more it will be perceived as a regional bully that possesses nuclear weapons. So the world will be a lot less forgiving on the nuclear issue. The situation of ambiguity, in which you dont have real legitimacy, is not a good place to be.\ The United States has called on Israel to join the nonproliferation treaty, but during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus visit to Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he recognizes the special nature of the threats Israel faces, and these threats warrant special security measures. The Americans want to appear just and fair because the issue is seen in Israel as completely sacred. They want to look as though they respect that. This agreement [with the U.S.] has been passed along from president to president, but I dont believe this issue is as sacred to Americans as it is to Israelis.\ Do you give credence to the slippery slope theory, under which abandoning ambiguity would lead to demands that Israel disarm? \Those are cliches used by the defense establishment. Nobody demands that Israel make such an announcement without first doing the preparatory work among its allies and the Arab states. This great fear of a slippery slope is ridiculous. Israel has its own interests; nobody can coerce it to do things.\ What about the claim that ambiguity is what keeps the Arab states from feeling a need to launch an arms race against Israel? \I dont dismiss that claim out of hand, and if, after study and thought, this fear turns out to be warranted, I would be prepared to wait. But in some ways, ambiguity is insulting to the Arabs. The claim you mention treats Arabs as though they were children: If they are told that Israel doesnt admit to it, that frees them of the need to deal with the reality. I believe the Arab countries dont want to play a game of make-believe, but rather want to discuss the topic directly and realistically.\ You say, basically, that Iran is imitating Israels nuclear behavior. That comparison would certainly rankle Israel supporters. \But the way Iran has advanced toward nuclear capability is not via announcements and tests, but rather by rumors. It can even remain within the bounds of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. If that rankles anybody, let it rankle. \If Iran is not attacked, it will want to achieve a status of ambiguity; I see this as nearly certain. The international community thus has another reason not to accept the idea of ambiguity as legitimate. The norm that a state with a nuclear weapon must say so clearly is part of the nonproliferation regime. The longer Iran continues down this path, the less patience the world will have for Israel.\ How do you envision the scenario of 'coming out of the nuclear closet?' \Censorship plays a very central role in the enforcement of nuclear ambiguity. So long as there is a [military] censor, it is very hard to alter ambiguity. If censorship didnt exist, israeli newspapers would be able to write about the subject more openly. \Another issue is the need for a law that addresses the nuclear topic. There is a Shin Bet [security service] law, but there is no law for the Mossad and no law for the Israel Atomic Energy Commission. This is a very problematic situation. \On the international level, its a sensitive subject that demands preparatory work. Ultimately, I see a political statement by Israels government in which the prime minister would find the right way to put this subject on the table. He would talk about the historical background and the responsible way Israel has dealt with this topic. With a few rare exceptions, these weapons have no military use; Israel views them as a means of deterrence. I dont think Israel would need to go into detail regarding how many [bombs] it has or exactly what it has. \Israel has a right to the bomb no less than New Delhi, or even the United States. Ambiguity creates a sense that we are sinners, as though we had done something so terrible that we can't tell the awful truth - and I don't think it is so awful. This is a country that the world has viewed as a nuclear state for a long time, and the time has come for it to say something positive on this huge, complicated and awe-inspiring topic... \All these states are ultimately committed under the treaty they signed to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. Whether that will happen in our lifetimes I cant say.\ You say ambiguity undermines Israeli democracy and prevents debate on matters of life and death, such as the question of whose finger will be on the button. Do you think the Israeli public is ready for such a discussion? \There has been very little creative thinking in this area, and ambiguity is one of the stifling factors that have produced an unacceptable, closed culture incapable of creative thinking. Ambiguitys power derives from the fact that Israeli society accepts it, and it seems to the public that any attempt to deviate from it would cause serious damage to Israeli security. \Ambiguity has created a public incapable of dealing with the topic, one that is afraid of it and prefers the issue to be handled by 'trustworthy hands' so that it does not have to take responsibility itself. Ambiguity has created an ignorant, craven public.which, in a certain sense, has betrayed its civic, democratic duties on this subject.\ Whats it like researching a topic nobody discusses? \When I started studying this subject 25 years ago, I had the feeling I was entering a palace where nothing could be touched. It took me years to find the right way to handle the topic responsibly - from a researchers perspective, not from the standpoint of someone who is directly involved in the matter. Today I think it is possible to initiate a meaningful dialogue about concrete, real issues.\ • Print Page • Send to a friend. • Comments • Share • Text Size -1-1: • Follow us on Twitter • Become a Haaretz.com Faceboolr friend This story is by: • atasha Mozoovaya

C05765980	Krugman, in case you haven't seen: January 1, 2010 Op-Ed Columnist Chinese New Year By PAUL KRUGMAN It's the season when pundits traditionally make predictions about the year ahead. Mine concerns international economics: I predict that 2010 will be the year of China. And not in a good way. Actually, the biggest problems with China involve climate change. But today I want to focus on currency policy. China has become a major financial and trade power. But it doesn't act like other big economies. Instead, it follows a mercantilist policy, keeping its trade surplus artificially high. And in today's depressed world, that policy is, to put it bluntly, predatory. Here's how it works: Unlike the dollar, the euro or the yen, whose values fluctuate freely, China's currency is pegged by official policy at about 6.8 yuan to the dollar. At this exchange rate, Chinese manufacturing has a large cost advantage over its rivals, leading to huge trade surpluses. Under normal circumstances, the inflow of dollars from those surpluses would push up the value of China's currency, unless it was offset by private investors heading the other way. And private investors are trying to get into China, not out of it. But China's government restricts capital inflows, even as it buys up dollars and parks them abroad, adding to a $2 trillion-plus hoard of foreign exchange reserves. This policy is good for China's export-oriented state-industrial complex, not so good for Chinese consumers. But what about the rest of us? In the past, China's accumulation of foreign reserves, many of which were invested in American bonds, was arguably doing us a favor by keeping interest rates low — although what we did with those low interest rates was mainly to inflate a housing bubble. But right now the world is awash in cheap money, looking for someplace to go. Short-term interest rates are close to zero; long-term interest rates are higher, but only because investors expect the zero-rate policy to end some day. China's bond purchases make little or no difference. Meanwhile, that trade surplus drains much-needed demand away from a depressed world economy. My back-of-the- envelope calculations suggest that for the next couple of years Chinese mercantilism may end up reducing U.S. employment by around 1.4 million jobs. The Chinese refuse to acknowledge the problem. Recently Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, dismissed foreign complaints: \On one hand, you are asking for the yuan to appreciate, and on the other hand, you are taking all kinds of protectionist measures.\ Indeed: other countries are taking (modest) protectionist measures precisely because China refuses to let its currency rise. And more such measures are entirely appropriate. Or are they? I usually hear two reasons for not confronting China over its policies. Neither holds water. First, there's the claim that we can't confront the Chinese because they would wreak havoc with the U.S. economy by dumping their hoard of dollars. This is all wrong, and not just because in so doing the Chinese would inflict large losses on themselves. The larger point is that the same forces that make Chinese mercantilism so damaging right now also mean that China has little or no financial leverage. Again, right now the world is awash in cheap money. So if China were to start selling dollars, there's no reason to think it would significantly raise U.S. interest rates. It would probably weaken the dollar against other currencies — but that would be good, not bad, for U.S. competitiveness and employment. So if the Chinese do dump dollars, we should send them a thank-you note.

The Senate Judiciary Committee last week was reviewing an amendment by Sen. Richard Durbin (D-I11.) to the USA Patriot Act to clarify the legal standard needed for an investigation under the act. The amendment was intended to provide greater protections from abuse by investigators. His colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), spoke in opposition, agreeing with committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and ranking Republican Jeff Sessions (Ala.) that additional protections are not needed. \I would just point to the actual language in here,\ Klobuchar said, \which is, its not like this is some pie-in- the-sky standard here. I mean, it specifically says,\ she noted approvingly, reading aloud from the bill, that there have to be \reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant to an authorized national security investigation,\ and you cant investigate someone just for exercising free speech rights and theres got to be some suspected foreign agent involved. \So I just, for anyone listening to this, it is not like there is no standard,\ she concluded. \There is a standard in place here.\ \Thats the standard that is in the bill now?\ Sessions asked. Klobuchar nodded that it was. No it's not, Durbin interrupted. \Senator Klobuchar, you just read my amendment,\ not the bill, he said -- \and I think its critically important that you understand what were establishing here.\ Whatever. Klobuchar voted against the amendment, which got only a handful of votes anyway. Blame the gatekeeper The usual pattern at the State Department is that the new secretary arrives at Foggy Bottom for the first day of work and enters to rousing cheers from career Foreign Service folks hoping the new boss will actually heed their expert advice. (They are, by nature, an optimistic crowd.) Then, after 7 months, 8 days and 12 hours, on average, the grumbling begins that the secretary is \not accessible\ to senior career folks, that she's overly protected by her personal staff, that the promised \open door\ has slammed shut. The fingers start pointing, usually at the secretary's chief of staff. These days, that's Cheryl Mills, who holds that post for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. We're hearing complaints even from members of the inner circle that the overworked Mills -- chief of staff, counselor, overseer of Haiti policy and food security policy and the department motor pool (okay, not really) -- has made entry to Clinton's suite something like penetrating the Green Zone in Baghdad. Not so, says Undersecretary of State William Burns, the department's top career official. \This secretary is in touch every day with as many people across the department as possible, and Cheryl is a big part of making that happen.\ Another senior State official said Clinton has been on the road a lot: Asia in July and Africa in August and Ireland and Moscow just the other day, and soon she'll be back on the road, pretty much until Thanksgiving. There have also been a bunch of meetings of late on AfPak matters. Hey, just telling you what we're hearing. In a timely fashion ... The Loop Better-Late-Than-Never award this year goes to the State Department's personnel bureau. The bureau, in an Oct. 13 notice, said it had awarded a $1.6 million contract to Campion Services Inc. in West Lafayette, Ind., to \assist the department in ensuring that all examinations for Foreign Service [jobs] have been professionally validated and constitute a reliable means of identifying those applicants with the greatest possibility of success in the foreign service.\ Well, good thing the department's only been hiring for a couple of hundred years. The rest of the résumé The White House last week announced that President Obama had selected Jessie H. Roberson, a nuclear expert and senior vice president of environmental affairs for the Atlantic Sea Island Group, to be a member of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The bio notes her previous jobs, even her undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering. Name sounds familiar. Roberson, Roberson: Wasn't she Dubya's appointee as assistant secretary of the Energy Department for environmental management, the $6 billion-a-year weapons cleanup program? That's not mentioned in the White House release, but she was there from 2001 to 2004. Waterboarding for kids? WGDB, Part II: Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) must be feeling stressed these days over the travails of his pal, Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.). For those who missed it, Coburn took to the Senate floor last week to decry federal deficits, which are not, for him, an abstraction. \It is deeply personal with me,\ Coburn explained. \I have five grandchildren. I look in their eyes, and I see the potential of their lives and all of these other children who are out there. You know what? We are going to waterboard them. That is what we are going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to flood them with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities.

C05767237	Madam Secretary, Jake mentioned that you would like to see a copy of John Podestas recent interview with the Financial Times. A transcript of the interview has not been posted yet, but I have included here the Financial Times article about the interview. Please just let me know if you would like any further information on this. Best, Mike Former aide urges Obama to regain political narrative By Edward Luce in Washington Published: February 15 2010 Barack Obama, US president, has lost control of the political narrative and needs to make more use of his cabinet in order to regain it, says John Podesta, the man who headed the presidents transition team. \My friends in the White House would agree with this, that they lost the narrative,\ Mr Podesta said in an interview for View from DC, the Financial Times video series from Washington. \Clearly that needs not one speech once in a while: it needs, I think, to be constantly reinforced. And not just by the president, but by his entire team ... Hes got a terrific cabinet. Use it. Get out into the country and use it.\ Mr Podesta, who was also a chief of staff to Bill Clinton, drew parallels with the former president's difficulties in his first two years, which culminated in the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress following the failure of healthcare reform. When asked whether the failure of this latest attempt at healthcare reform would result in a similar electoral \massacre\ for the Democratic party at the mid-term elections in November, he said: \I subscribe to that view.\ Mr Podesta founded the Centre for American Progress, Washington's largest liberal think-tank, which was often described as a \government-in-exile\ during the years George W. Bush was in the White House. He said Mr Obama had three options with healthcare reform. First, try to enact the whole thing by using the budget reconciliation process, which would enable it to pass with 51 votes. The Democrats lost their controlling 60-seat super-majority last month in a election defeat in Massachusetts. The second would be to pass a watered down bill with Republican support The third would be to abandon the attempt, as Mr Clinton did in 1993. Mr Podesta, whom Mr Obama still regularly consults, said there was still a better than 50:50 chance of getting reform through. \The worst option among the three is doing nothing, and so theyre going to have to figure out which track is viable,\ he said. \It may mean doing it with only Democratic votes. But if that is such, then so be it.\ He painted a fairly bleak view of the overall health of US politics. \It sucks,\ he said. Pointing to a strategy of obstructionism by Republican lawmakers, he said: \I think the president is trying to re-engage with Republicans, but, quite frankly, hes not dealing with the party of [Abraham] Lincoln. Hes dealing with the party of [Sarah] Palin.\ The growth of partisanship and the increasing difficulty in getting any big reforms through the Senate were threatening to turn the US into, \in essence, a parliamentary system without majority rule\, where the opposition automatically opposes any serious initiatives. The political stasis in California provided the writing on the wall for the US as a whole, he said. Since the 1978 passage of Proposition 13 in the state, all budget changes had required a two-thirds majority. \And so nothing gets done.\ Michael H.

C05762452	ebeigetu flork antes Just FYI. Palau UN Amb. Beck says you were friends in law school & thought you recognized him when he came in w/Pres. Toribiong. Hope youre not in pain and mend soon. Jeff June 20, 2009 The Myth of the $12 Million Uighur . By STUART BECK CONGRATULATIONS Palau. Our little country, a group of islands 500 miles east of the Philippines, has become, if only briefly, a household word. President Obama, much admired in Palau, asked our new president, Johnson Toribiong, to do the United States a favor: Please accept, as refugees, a group of innocent Chinese Muslims. They are not anti-American terrorists, but victims of human rights violations, who landed at Guantanamo Bay for seven years. Innocent, stateless, harmless. President Toribiong, a lawyer trained at the University of Washington and a highly regarded litigator, told President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that he needed to assure his people that the Uighurs were indeed harmless, and could be integrated into Palaus small, diverse and friendly culture. Assuming that this due diligence brought satisfactory results, Palau would be pleased to give the refugees temporary residence. Last weekend, he dispatched a number of officials to Guantanamo to interview the Uighurs and review their records. One would have thought that this positive gesture of friendship from a staunch American ally would have been applauded, at least in the United States. Instead, for reasons that are beyond me, unattributed leaks and unsubstantiated rumors have twisted Palaus act of decency into another grab for dollars by a cunning third-world country. In breaking the story that Palau was amenable to President Obamas request, the Associated Press reported that two anonymous State Department officials had linked Palaus acceptance of the Uighurs to a $200 million payoff. Almost immediately, much of the news media took the bait, did the math and asserted that Palau was getting nearly $12 million dollars per Uighur. Within a day or two, The Wall Street Journal was pontificating against a shakedown. Before the story gets too far out of hand, lets consider a few facts. It is true that the United States and Palau have an economic relationship. Palau has been receiving American aid since it was wrested from the Japanese in 1944. (Over the past 15 years, this has averaged about $56 million a year.) This aid has come with strings; as the United States has always insisted that the Palauan government be ready to promptly turn over land for bases should the security of the United States or Palau require it. B6 In 1994, the two countries agreed to a 50-year option that allows the United States to use Palau for military purposes. That agreements economic terms expire in October 2009, and a new economic package for the remaining 35 years is in the works — and has been for some time. But there has never been a mention of $200 million. And no one has even hinted at linking the deal to Palaus acceptance of the Uighurs. The United States simply offered to pay relocation costs for the Uighurs of less than $90,000 per person to cover transportation, food, housing and medical help until the men can get oriented and get jobs. Palau is a small and peaceful community. Its constitution bans weapons of all kinds. Capital crimes are virtually unknown. Social life revolves around the family. Children wander from house to house. Could anyone believe that the leaders of Palau would risk the safety and serenity of their modern Eden in exchange for money? Is it plausible that these close-knit people would countenance the presence of terrorists in their midst? I can assure you the answer is no. Last week, the Palauans lowered their flags to half-staff in memory of Sgt. Jasper Obakrairur, a Palauan who joined the United States Marines and died on June 1 helping to root out the Taliban in Afghanistan. He was the fourth Palauan serviceman to die in recent years, following his fallen comrades in American uniform Cpl. JayGee Meluat, Cpl. Meresebang Ngiraked and Specialist Philton Ueld. The people of Palau are very proud of them, and of our countrys special relationship with the United States. Cant Americans be proud of the relationship, too? Stuart Beck is Palaus permanent representative to the United Nations.

Sid -elated some information to me about one of the young Americans being held hostage that might possibly be helpful. This piece of information may be useful if charges are made that he is somehow a spy. besides writing a book about the former president, is Shane Bauer, one of the hostages, is a young photojournalist who is a Nation Institute grantee. He is an Arabic speaker who has a grant to write on Middle East issues. He has written not only for The Nation but also for Christian Science Monitor, San Francisco Chronicle, and most importantly, the Al Jazeera English speaking website. According to he lives in the region most of the time, was traveling with his girlfriend in Kurdistan, has an interest in Kurdish affairs, was on a hiking trip, and obviously and inadvertently crossed an unmarked border. He was not acting as a journalist at the time, though he is a journalist--and a left-wing kid. Sid

When I saw her some months ago, she went on at length about her respect for you and her meeting with you when you were Senator (she also met you at the Rejkavik W conf in '98) We are going to hold a US-Russia women leaders Summit in St P in aprik It is in response to what I heard over and over during my trip earlier this year that there is a strong desire (and need) to engage with US. Women and the women's issues have been mostly off the agenda since the days we made it such a priority in the 90's and there is considerable recidivism. She should be happy about the proposed summit. Secondly, when you meet with the Lithuanian FM this week, he will invite you to the community of Democ ministerial (end for Lith presidency) and as part of it a women and democ. Conf that will mark 10 years since the last one that was held in the continuum you started. There are so many different needs today. Have a good trip.

C05760843	Dear Secretary Clinton: I am a Professional Member of the American Society for Industrial Security, and the American College of Forensic Examiners; I have guest lectured and taught industrial security management, homeland security, port and harbor security and critical incident response management. As elated as everyone is over the splendid outcome of the Maersk Alabama hijacking case, as I had predicted, in today's news, it is reported that four additional vessels were attacked and now Terrorists are holding some 60 hostages. Before anyone, does anything regarding Somalia, may I make the following comments and observations. What is going on in the Gulf of Aden is as an organized criminal enterprise for profit. There are some 250 hostages being held and they are being kept as well as they can be under the circumstances because the terrorists are expecting a payday out of this. As soon as they see any form of direct Military action in the northeast at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden, I can assure you more Americans will be abducted, and we will see another series of video beheadings under a Democratic watch. I would recommend that the Secretary encourage the United Nations to create an International Maritime Security Working Group. Since the Shipping Industry has already absorbed something like Fifty Billion Dollars regarding the various piracy incidents in 2008 alone; they have the resources to contract private security/military contractors who could work onboard merchant shipping in International Waters. Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton April 14, 2009 Page 2 of 2. They could rotate from the northern edge of the threat envelope to the southern end and take direct action on a case-by-case basis. Through this endeavor, as these targets of opportunity begin to dry up, so will the piracy activity that the World community has pacified by the payment of extortion money. Thank you in advance for your anticipated interest, and cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, ROBERT A. DANFORD, ACFE. ASIS.
C05772445	Agreed--Maura is so smart!

C05772632	I agree. As you know I believe passionately that it is not in our national interests to continue to provide billions of dollars in aid and assistance without the very people we are helping knowing we are the ones providing the assistance. Some of our research in Pakistan indicates that many people believe the assistancee is coming from China and of course the Chinese do nothing to correct the record. I asked INR to provide me with an assessment of the current situation after the floods to determine the impact of our assistance. I have also asked them to work with the IC to give us an accurate and unbiased assessment of the security risks involved. I aksed for it a couple of weeks ago so hopefully they will have something we can use now which might be helpful in drafting a response. In terms of the security arguments he makes, it is worth noting that the incidents he references are situations where the attacks occured in places where there was NO USG branding. The reality is that the terrorists attack any group or institution which might impede their ability to prevail. I had already planned a USAID/State meeting to address this issue this week. I'll try to get everyone together today or tomorrow and will report back to you.

C05739623	Romney has an op-ed in today's Wall Street Journal playing off Stevens' murder to say Obama has put \security at risk,\ etc. According to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over Libya. Obviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove's surrogate is now a Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens. Romney is careening from tactic to tactic, hoping something will catch. I wouldn't be surprised to see Romney raise the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood in charge of Egypt & Libya as a bogeyman. I have heard him do this within the last week. ----

C05766567	sbwhoeop Tuesday, December 22, 2009 7:28 PM any truth to this account? Sid H: Is this account true? If so, significant, and the only account of its kind. And, if true, the USG has not told its story, at the least. Sid X r --r How do I know China wrecked the Copenhagen deal? I was in the room As recriminations fly post-Copenhagen, one writer offers a fly-on-the-wall account of how talks faded 0 0 Mark cvnas o c. ..q,uk, Tuesday 22 December 2009 19.54 GMT Copenhagen was a disaster. That much is agreed. But the truth about what actually happened is in danger of being lost amid the spin and inevitable mutual recriminations. The truth is this: Chrs.a wrecked the talks, intentionally humiliated Barack Obama, and insisted on an awful \dear so western leaders would walk away carrying the blame. How do I know this? Because I was in the room and saw it happen. Chinas strategy was simple: block the open negotiations for two weeks, and then ensure that the closed-door deal made It look as if the west had failed the worlds poor once again. And sure enough, the aid agencies, civil society movements and environmental groups all took the bait. The failure was \the inevitable result of rich countries refusing adequately and fairly to shoulder their overwhelming responsibility\, said Christian Aid. \Rich countries have bullied developing nations,\ fumed Friends of the Earth International. All very predictable, but the complete opposite of the truth. Even George IVIonbiot, writing in yesterdays Guardian, made the mistake of singly blaming Obama. But I saw Obama fighting desperately to salvage a deal, and the Chinese delegate saying \no\, over and over again. Monbiot even approvingly quoted the Sudanese delegate Lumumba Di-Aping, who denounced the Copenhagen accord as \a suicide pact, an incineration pact, in order to maintain the economic dominance of a few countries\. Sudan behaves at the talks as a puppet of China; one of a number of countries that relieves the Chinese delegation of having to fight its battles in open sessions. It was a perfect stitch-up. China gutted the deal behind the scenes, and then left its proxies to savage it in public. Heres what actually went on late last Friday night, as heads of state from two dozen countries met behind closed doors. Obama was at the table for several hours, sitting between Gordon Brown and the Ethiopian prime minister, Males Zenawi. The Danish prime minister chaired, and on his right sat Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the UN. Probably only about 50 or 60 people, including the heads of state, were in the room. I was attached to one of the delegations, whose head of state was also present for most of the time. What I saw was profoundly shocking. The Chinese premier, Wen Jinbao, did not deign to attend the meetings personally, instead sending a second-tier official in the countrys foreign ministry to sit opposite Obama himself. The diplomatic snub was obvious and brutal, as was the practical implication: several times during the session, the worlds most powerful heads of state were forced to wait around as the Chinese delegate went off to make telephone calls to his \superiors\. Shifting the blame To those who would blame Obama and rich countries in general, know this: it was Chinas representative who insisted that industrialised country targets, previously agreed as an 80% cut by 2050, be taken out of the deal. \Why can't we even mention our own targets?\ demanded a furious Angela Merkel. Australias prime minister, Kevin Rudd, was annoyed enough to bang his microphone. Brazils representative too pointed out the illogicality of Chinas position. Why should rich countries not announce even this unilateral cut? The Chinese delegate said no, and I watched, aghast, as Merkel threw up her hands in despair and conceded the point. Now we know why — because China bet, correctly, that Obama would get the blame for the Copenhagen accords lack of ambition. China, backed at times by India, then proceeded to take out all the numbers that mattered. A 2020 peaking year in global emissions, essential to restrain temperatures to 2C, was removed and replaced by woolly language suggesting that emissions should peak \as soon as possible\. The long-term target, of global 50% cuts by 2050, was also excised. No one else, perhaps with the exceptions of India and Saudi Arabia, wanted this to happen. I am certain that had the Chinese not been in the room, we would have left Copenhagen with a deal that had environmentalists popping champagne corks popping in every corner of the world. Strong position So how did China manage to pull off this coup? First, it was in an extremely strong negotiating position. China didnt need a deal. As one developing country foreign minister said to me: \The Athenians had nothing to offer to the Spartans.\ On the other hand, western leaders in particular — but also presidents Lula of Brazil, Zuma of South Africa, Calderon of Mexico and many others — were desperate for a positive outcome. Obama needed a strong deal perhaps more than anyone. The US had confirmed the offer of $100bn to developing countries for adaptation, put serious cuts on the table for the first time (17% below 2005 levels by 2020), and was obviously prepared to up its offer. Above all, Obama needed to be able to demonstrate to the Senate that he could deliver China in any global climate regulation framework, so conservative senators could not argue that US carbon cuts would further advantage Chinese industry. With midterm elections looming, Obama and his staff also knew that Copenhagen would be probably their only opportunity to go to cjinT3t?j..chanQE-3. talks with a strong mandate. This further strengthened Chinas negotiating hand, as did the complete lack of civil society political pressure on either China or India. Campaign groups never blame developing countries for failure; this is an iron rule that is never broken. The Indians, in particular. have become past masters at ca- opting the language of equity (\equal rights to the atmosphere\) in the service of planetary suicide — and leftish campaigners and commentators are hoist with their own petard. With the deal gutted, the heads of state session concluded with a final battle as the Chinese delegate insisted on removing the 1.5C target so beloved of the small island states and low-lying nations who have most to lose from rising seas. President Nasheed of the Maldives, supported by Brown, fought valiantly to save this crucial number. \How can you ask my country to go extinct?\ demanded Nasheed. The Chinese delegate feigned great offence — and the number stayed, but surrounded by language which makes it all but meaningless. The deed was done. Chinas game All this raises the question: what is Chinas game? Why did China, in the words of a UK-based analyst who also spent hours in heads of state meetings, \not only reject targets for itself, but also refuse to allow any other country to take on binding targets?\ The analyst, who has attended climate conferences for more than 15 years, concludes that China wants to weaken the climate regulation regime now \in order to avoid the risk that it might be called on to be more ambitious in a few years' time\. This does not mean China is not serious about global warming. It is strong in both the wind and solar industries. But Chinas growth, and growing global political and economic dominance, is based largely on cheap coal. China knows it is becoming an uncontested superpower; indeed its newfound muscular confidence was on striking display in Copenhagen. Its coal-based economy doubles every decade, and its power increases commensurately. Its leadership will not alter this magic formula unless they absolutely have to. Copenhagen was much worse than just another bad deal, because it illustrated a profound shift in global geopolitics. This is fast becoming Chinas century, yet its leadership has displayed that multilateral environmental governance is not only not a priority, but is viewed as a hindrance to the new superpowers freedom of action. I left Copenhagen more despondent than I have felt in a long time. After all the hope and all the hype, the mobilisation of thousands, a wave of optimism crashed against the rock of global power politics, fell back, and drained away. [Go]

I know this is a very difficult time for everyone at the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you. I had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up to speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith. Based on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need to address: • Work with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the communications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively • Develop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all aspects of the initiative • Increase public awareness in Mexico about \Merida\ ; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very little awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG • Work with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people across the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their way through this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what programs are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lack of this sort of \personally relevant\ information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to the overall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haiti and last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using a wide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in a very granular ,local, personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady stream of gruesome news being put out by traditional media. • Work with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness of the initiative and maintain public support for the effort • Increase awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in US Keith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDA taking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able to overcome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I have reached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sector once we have a plan of action in place. Finally, with regard to next weeks trip by S, Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late April rather than have it as part of next weeks agenda. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. Keith is also prepared to come next week or in April. Just let us know. Judth

SANGER and THOM SHANKER Published: April 18, 2010 WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has warned in a secret three-page memorandum to top White House officials that the United States does not have an effective long-range policy for dealing with Irans steady progress toward nuclear capability, according to government officials familiar with the document. Several officials said the highly classified analysis, written in January to President Obamas national security adviser, Gen. James L. Jones, touched off an intense effort inside the Pentagon, the White House and the intelligence agencies to develop new options for Mr. Obama. They include a revised set of military alternatives, still under development, to be considered should diplomacy and sanctions fail to force Iran to change course. Officials familiar with the memos contents would describe only portions dealing with strategy and policy, and not sections that apparently dealt with secret operations against Iran, or how to deal with Persian Gulf allies. One senior official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the memo, described the document as \a wake-up call.\ But White House officials dispute that view, insisting that for 15 months they had been conducting detailed planning for many possible outcomes regarding Irans nuclear program. In an interview on Friday, General Jones declined to speak about the memorandum. But he said: \On Iran, we are doing what we said we were going to do. The fact that we don't announce publicly our entire strategy for the world to see doesn't mean we don't have a strategy that anticipates the full range of contingencies - we do.\ But in his memo, Mr. Gates wrote of a variety of concerns, including the absence of an effective strategy should Iran choose the course that many government and outside analysts consider likely: Iran could assemble all the major parts it needs for a nuclear weapon - fuel, designs and detonators - but stop just short of assembling a fully operational weapon. In that case, Iran could remain a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty while becoming what strategists call a \virtual\ nuclear weapons state. According to several officials, the memorandum also calls for new thinking about how the United States might contain Irans power if it decided to produce a weapon, and how to deal with the possibility that fuel or weapons could be obtained by one of the terrorist groups Iran has supported, which officials said they considered to be a less-likely possibility. Mr. Gates has never mentioned the memo in public. His spokesman, Geoff Morrell, declined comment on specifics in the document, but issued a statement on Saturday saying, \The secretary believes the president and his national security team have spent an extraordinary amount of time and effort considering and preparing for the full range of contingencies with respect to Iran.\ Pressed on the administrations ambiguous phrases until now about how close the United States was willing to allow. Irans program to proceed, a senior administration official described last week in somewhat clearer terms that there was a line Iran would not be permitted to cross. The official said that the United States would ensure that Iran would not \acquire a nuclear capability,\ a step Tehran could get to well before it developed a sophisticated weapon. \That includes the ability to have a breakout,\ he said, using the term nuclear specialists apply to a country that suddenly renounces the nonproliferation treaty and uses its technology to build a small arsenal. Nearly two weeks ago, Mr. Obama, in an interview with The New York Times, was asked about whether he saw a difference between a nuclear-capable Iran and one that had a fully developed weapon. \Im not going to parse that right now,\ he said. But he noted that North Korea was considered a nuclear-capable state until it threw out inspectors and, as he said, \became a self-professed nuclear state.\ Mr. Gates has alluded to his concern that intelligence agencies might miss signals that Iran was taking the final steps toward producing a weapon. Last Sunday on the NBC News program \Meet the Press,\ he said: \If their policy is to go to the threshold but not assemble a nuclear weapon, how do you tell that they have not assembled? I dont actually know how you would verify that.\ But he cautioned that Iran had run into production difficulties, and he said, \Its going slow - slower than they anticipated, but they are moving in that direction.\ Mr. Gates has taken a crucial role in formulating the administration's strategy, and he has been known over his career to issue stark warnings against the possibility of strategic surprise. Some officials said his memo should be viewed in that light: as a warning to a relatively new president that the United States was not adequately prepared. He wrote the memo after Iran had let pass a 2009 deadline set by Mr. Obama to respond to his offers of diplomatic engagement. Both that process and efforts to bring new sanctions against Iran have struggled. Administration officials had hoped that the revelation by Mr. Obama in September that Iran was building a new uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain near Qum would galvanize other nations against Iran, but the reaction was muted. The next three months were spent in what proved to be fruitless diplomatic talks with Iran over a plan to swap much of its low-enriched uranium for fuel for a medical reactor in Tehran. By the time Mr. Gates wrote his memo, those negotiations had collapsed. Mr. Gates's memo appears to reflect concerns in the upper echelons of the Pentagon and the military that the White House did not have a well-prepared series of alternatives in place in case all the diplomatic steps finally failed. In fact, just before Mr. Gates issued his warning, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, wrote an official \chairmans guidance\ to his staff saying that while any military option would have \limited results\ against Irans nuclear facilities, preparations needed to be stepped up. \Should the president call for military options, we must have them ready,\ the admiral wrote. Administration officials testifying before a Senate committee last week made it clear that those preparations were under way. So did General Jones. \The president has made it clear from the beginning of this administration that we need to be prepared for every possible contingency,\ he said in the interview. \That is what we have done from day one, while successfully building a coalition of nations to isolate Iran and pressure it to live up to its obligations.\ At the same hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Lt. Gen. Ronald L. Burgess Jr., director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and one of the militarys most experienced officers on nuclear matters, said that Iran could produce bomb-grade fuel for at least one nuclear weapon within a year, but that it would probably need two to five years to manufacture a workable atomic bomb. The administration has been stepping up efforts to contain the influence of Iran and counter its missiles, including placing Patriot anti-missile batteries, mostly

Join our mailing list: Sign up to stay up to date on the latest headlines via email. ftagiou, -b ialEffilgandwa ol§to PolilitN To say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile mixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to mitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November. The bad news is that its too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what the House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldnt keep Americans employed. The \Obama Doctrine\ should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to contribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector cant meet the demand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and schools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global economy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to taxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30 points of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, \We dont have a shortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work.\ That message resonates across the political spectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest deficit-cutting language the other side can muster. But it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This Week several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come down -- as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures whose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children are hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who did are once again making out like bandits. Although the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting themselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle America from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they understand the public mood and speak to it. What is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger -- and it cuts across partisan lines. On the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at what could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the vast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their children's future. How to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts So how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts. Act I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and Reconciliation without the Truth Part • A strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail. By October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening to their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance. • A Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout with no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say \no\ in a situation like this and let a Great Recession turn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these are Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy of Republican ideology. • A charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are frightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to \government is the problem, not the solution\ and a path back to economic recovery and security. • The White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear. • The first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that we should \look forward, not backward,\ even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As conservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or President Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five either behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who gambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to repeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't subside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 - - it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his first year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton, to co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if forced to, he would cite unnamed \naysayers,\ \Washington politics as usual,\ or \Congress,\ which was counterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this messaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories: • The second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential when the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best educators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but never repeated what was a superb explanation --- nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked him for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office because of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and unpaid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice except our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations). A year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but appeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start. • The third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his party were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding by conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came. • The White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to- Washington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise. But the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to stimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what they learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the Republicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and warning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be needed to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start returning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the president chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of voters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point for the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier. • The economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of dramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that this new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new \stimulus\ act will do cauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and no one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never adequately crafted or sold. • The logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the future, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the excesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new president and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the Democrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president nor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that received bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but don't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury, the banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit card debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government. • Despite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even investigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses. Act II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan • The public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all, and the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the same time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1 margin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it, as evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for opponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it. • But instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising any new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to \sell\ health care without a narrative. (I wrote about this in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to state where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we should have a \public option\ (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine the support it might have received if it had been called instead \the one health care plan the health insurance companies dont get to control\). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as \bending the cost curve\ while conservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as \government takeover,\ \a bureaucrat between you and your doctor,\ and \death panels.\ • Instead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would explain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without protagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public. • Over interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for seniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social Security despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the \serial bribery\ of Republican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote. • At the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like alternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of even swing voters wanting it included in the bill. • Instead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that government can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the better plans theyve negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are \Cadillacs\ that are going to be taxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government cant do anything right and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record supporting government or spending. • \Government\ hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts. • Populist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the presidents job approval with swing voters drops into the high thirties. • Following the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that when in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to \reassure\ the public on health care that abortion wont be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didnt find that reassuring), that domestic partners wont be covered, and that immigrants wont be covered. None of these issues needed to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive positions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.) • The White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly confused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The president talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families tightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy; pledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and \clean coal\ (which doesnt exist, by the way) in a speech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for passing \No Latino Left Behind,\ while publicly objecting to the legislation. • The underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal parts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and incoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center desperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both FDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesnt win any votes on the right. But it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and betrayed (if theyre part of the \professional left\) or less likely to vote (if theyre average voters who dont follow politics carefully but just dont feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they dont really know why). • Capping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the \drill here, drill now,\ \all of the above\ position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect opportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety, the land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans against big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what happened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate) and what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself on the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control information for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear indistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists. Where Do We Go from Here? So that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to vote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and a vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things arent going well. In January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats might lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American public knew we had just seen -- the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the American people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was necessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work. But there were red flags already by the end of Obamas first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the new administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or youll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending. Re-brand government because theres only one story out there now (Reagans), and its not one that supports a progressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the public to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, dont throw another one. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White House hasnt consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and when he does, he does them well. The question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the game. The answer is that wed better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk about deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats Achilles Heel, particularly now -- there is little question that if Democrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven, and speak to peoples worries and anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their opponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and fiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate conservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on issue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans and small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists. But actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we should have seen a year and a half ago, but it isnt too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans - - virtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of work by the Republicans corporate sponsors. It isnt too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular aid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police all over the country with Republicans desire to throw them out onto the street. It isnt too late to make a voting issue out of the bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against them, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this country, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid paying their fair share of American taxes. Its not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a reasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. Its not too late to pass the first badly need \fix\ to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this was just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while cutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so essential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. Its not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to prevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. Its not too late to introduce legislation thats been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the voice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns. On every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need to play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block, knowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative from what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- \the Republicans wont let us do it\ -- to a narrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between two well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values. That leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and who led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That narrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a seemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key elements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street is gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent aboUt the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work, then we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from competing with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional investments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe fuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow. That's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.

I am making FM calls re Afghanistan which are going well and the memcons will describe the specific responses for our followup, especially in Athens and Brussels. Below is a memo from a concerned observer about the British feeling alienated from us. /Let me know what you each think. Thx. Consensus across the board in Britain—center, right, left—is that the Atlantic alliance—the special relationship—the historic bond since World War II—is shattered. There is no dissenting voice, not one, and there are no illusions. Opinion is unanimous. The bottom line is that the Obama administration's denigration of the UK is seen as the summation of the Bush era. Undoubtedly, you saw this week Minister of Defense Bob Ainsworth's public criticism of Obama's indecision and his accusation that the president is indifferent and damaging to British interest. While Downing Street sought to ameliorate his remarks with an oleaginous statement his view is simply what everyone—everyone—thinks. His clumsy outburst was a classic gaffe—an embarrassing mistake because it reveals something true. The Chilcot inquiry of Parliament, publicly conducting hearings on the origins of UK involvement in the Iraq invasion, has put Bush's war on terror—and British involvement—on trial—and the calmly conducted but eviscerating hearings will go on for another year. Blair is seen as either complicit on the basis of knowing there was no casus belli or as an enthusiastically deceived tool. Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has stated that the reason support for the Afghanistan mission has cratered is because of the lies told in the run-up to the Iraq war—another view universally held. Meanwhile, former UK ambassador to the US Christopher Meyer has published his new book on the history of UK diplomacy with concluding sections on the demise of the special relationship. He is not only being interviewed on all British media but also has appeared as a voluble witness before the Chi!cot commission. All British newspapers and journals have prominently published many pieces within the last week on the decline and fall of the US-UK relationship. Please see the lead editorial today from the London Times and the cover story from the Spectator—two of the most resolutely pro-American sources. The tone is not resentful, but reserved, disdainful and superior. The US administration is considered blinkered, parochial and counter-productive. Conservatives are more contemptuous than Labour, which feels abandoned and somewhat baffled. Rather than eager to be Obama's poodle, Cameron would be superficially friendly and privately scornful. Class has a lot to do with the contempt. A Cameron government would be more aristocratic and even narrowly Etonian than any Conservative government in recent history, sharply contrasting especially with the striving and classless perspective of the grocer's daughter, Margaret Thatcher. And yet, the most recent poll this week showed Labour within striking distance of the Tories, about five points down, the result of a slight economic uptick. A hung parliament seems very possible. Given the distribution of voting patterns, Labour need not win a plurality to have more seats than the Tories. The slight buoyancy for Labour in this unique situation has only heightened anxiety about Obama's Afghanistan process, which has excluded the British government from significant consultation and consideration of its interests. See the lead to Con Coughlin's Spectator piece. Therefore, the President might contemplate a brief stop in London going to or coming from Oslo or a meeting in Copenhage to make a public appearance with Brown. And, others in the Administration should pay special attention to Brown to secure strong support from him, and more importantly, the whole government and British establishment should be reassured that we do value their stalwart support despite the ups and downs of the last eight years. Pasted below is the Times editorial and the link to the Spectator article. From The Times November 26, 2009 Atlantic drift Washington's delay in announcing its Afghanistan strategy has left Brown drifting. Obama needs to invest more time and attention in the transatlantic alliance President Obama declared on Tuesday that \the whole world\ had a responsibility to help the US-led mission in Afghanistan. He would, he said; soon lay out the \obligations of our international partners\. Those partners have been waiting a long time for the details. On Monday the President had his tenth meeting with his advisers to work out his strategy for Afghanistan. He has now spent almost three months considering his options, and has promised an announcement on deployments after the Thanksgiving holiday. For Gordon Brown, this cannot come too soon. After the United States, Britain is the largest contributor of troops to the Nato operation in Afghanistan. There has never been any suggestion that Britain has enough soldiers to pursue a separate strategy or that it can operate independently of the US forces, which already number some 68,000 troops. Until the White House decides whether to send an extra 40,000 or some figure significantly lower than the number requested by General Stanley McChrystal, Mr Brown cannot properly plan the best support strategy. It is becoming sadly apparent that Britain has been left drifting by the delays in Washington, and that the Obama Administration is largely unaware of the embarrassment this is causing the Government. More worryingly, this does not seem to be a source of concern within the Administration. Downing Street, diplomatically, turns aside any suggestion that it is frustrated by the nonchalance with which it is being treated. But the insistent questions on Afghanistan, the anger caused by the steady stream of returning war dead and the rapid crumbling of public support for the war cannot be answered effectively until Mr Brown is taken into American confidence and seen as a full partner in the Nato campaign. On the surface, the continuing high regard in Britain for the dynamic and articulate new President has masked these growling complaints. Mr Brown is not suffering, as his predecessor did, from the taint of close association with a deeply unpopular US president. On the contrary: like several European leaders, he is still eager to position himself as close as possible to Mr Obama to clothe himself in some of the President's European popularity. But within Government, there is already worry that Britain's voice counts far less than it did in the past. This is not simply another instance of the persistent but pointless British anxiety over the so-called special relationship; it is a justified concern that two of the main pillars of the Nato alliance should have policies and strategies that are closely co-ordinated and sympathetically understood on both sides when fighting a war. The fault, glaringly, is on the American side. The White House no longer seems to be monitoring the reactions and political options of its transatlantic allies. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Administration sees little point in investing time and diplomacy in a British government likely to be defeated in the coming general election; wartime allies have interests that go far beyond the political make-up of the government of the day. Mr Obama promised during his election campaign to revive trust in American leadership and to re-engage in multinational diplomacy. In office, he has certainly voiced the same ideals; but he has invested little in giving new substance and dynamism to the transatlantic relationship. On Afghanistan, Mr Brown has sometimes been left speechless by Washington. He talks of sending 500 extra troops. But until he knows the likely US strategy, he cannot outline his own. Atlanticism is always fragile on the Left and was stretched to breaking point by Tony Blair. It is now being undermined by indifference in Washington. Today America is enjoying Thanksgiving. Tomorrow it must look out again to its all THE SPECTATOR A special form of disrespect Con Coughlin <http://www.spectator.co.uk/search/authorfisearchString=Con%20Coughlin> Wednesday, 18th November 2009

JoDee Winterhof raised questions about how the PRTs and the language DOD uses about them are problematic for NGOs like care. Pls ask one of Holbrooke's people if they ever talked to Wolfgang Danspeckgruber at Princeton about building a railroad in Aghanistan. Also Dr. Arthur Keys at International Relief + Development wanted to talk w someone from Holbrooke's team about development in Af. I asked the Spec IG for Af Recon, Arnold Fields, to alert us to problems as soon as they can. I'm not sure how to formalize this or even if it's appropriate. Let's discuss.

Davut confirmed substance of Jake S's comments to me, said he Davut had one hour to get statement out to meet TU press cycle, and said Namik Tan would contact me asap with proposed text. That said Davut then described substance of what he thought should be in it (he also was not clear on whether it to be a joint statement, coordinated sep statements or just a TU statement that we'd OK and thus support once out). However he did say he wanted to put in statement We went back and forth on that and both conluded Namik and I would work out. Will get back asap. Jim
C05769981	Cheryl and I discussed how to do an effective strategy session. Monday early afternoon is the first clear shot we have at getting the right group of people in the room together for an extended period of time. We propose to start the discussion from the following premise: We've addressed, in one fashion or another, to one degree of satisfaction or another, most of the major items we set out at the beginning of last near. We've moved the needle, but we haven't changed the game. Now the question is, what are the major milestones over the next 12-18 months? What should we be aiming at? And especially, what are some potential game-changers — moves that would shift the global landscape in meaningful and long-lasting ways? Everything will be on the table — regional issues, transnational issues, etc. Everyone should read the book of look-ahead papers; identify things they think we should pursue; and add ideas — especially creative and far-reaching ideas — on top of what's contained in them. We propose the following roster: Jim Jack Bill AMS Derek CDM Jake Rich Kurt Judith Harold Let us know what you think. Jake

C05775435	Eco.docx- 25Nov2010.doc This is a very thoughtful piece that identifies many of the same factors we are in our diplomatic chapter (and that is not just because the author – the former Bangladesh ambassador to the US—cites me). What is most striking is that it affirms that our analysis in the QDDR offers a set of questions that foreign ministries all over the world are grappling with. I had hoped to have time to do some traveling to broadcast the QDDR to key allies and partners around the world after the QDDR is in, but even if that can't happen, we will devise an outreach strategy re sending the report out to foreign ministers around the world and to our ambassadors that will greatly amplify its impact.

C05770370	How Come we havent? This is what we are up against. Betrayed They said we were there to save Afghanistan's women. So how come we haven't? BY VALERIE M. HUDSON, PATRICIA LEIDL I MAY 10, 2010 One day in November 2009, in Helmand province's capital of Lashkar Gah, a group of Afghan widows and divorcees met with Patricia, who had been commissioned to write a series of success stories for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). All the women were in their 20s, 30s, and 40s but looked to be in their 60s. Until very recently, none of them could work because they possessed no marketable skills, could neither read nor write, and were at risk of being killed if they left their homes. A number of women said that, before the program -- which focused on tailoring and basic literacy -- their children used to weep at night from hunger. COMMENTS (22) SHARE: Twitter Reddit Buzz EMore... As Patricia prepared to leave, the women fluttered around her like moths, touching her sleeves and speaking all at once. 'What are they saying?\ Pat asked the young Pashto-speaking interpreter. \They are telling you to go back to your country and to ask your people not to abandon them. The women of Afghanistan don't want you to leave. They will quite literally die if the Taliban return,\ she said. In a recent question-and-answer period at one of our universities, Brigham Young, a student asked Gen. David Petraeus whether anyone thought to ask the women of Afghanistan how they felt about U.S. hopes to incorporate \reformed\ Taliban into governance structures as the Americans leave. Carefully avoiding the word \women,\ the general assured the questioning student that only \moderate\ Taliban would be eligible for such rehabilitation. Left unaddressed was the definition of \moderate,\ which clearly depends on where you sit: If you sit in a burqa, there is no such thing as a \moderate\ Taliban. Petraeus might find it easy now to sidestep the question of what will happen to Afghanistans women once the \moderate\ Taliban come back, but its likely to haunt him for a long time. Without the security of women there is no security -- and until weve done more to protect it, we have a moral and practical obligation to stay in Afghanistan. In 2001, George W. Bushs administration interpreted the first post-invasion photos of Afghan girls heading to school and of Afghan women unveiling their faces as tangible evidence that conditions were improving in that benighted land. A few months after the invasion, in his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush announced, \The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan's new government.\ The Americans strong-armed a handful of women into the loya jirga that then drafted the Afghan Constitution. They strong-armed a quota for women in the Afghan national legislature -- something that even American women are not treated to. U.S. troops built schools for girls and pushed for women to be included in the local shuras, and USAID ripped a page from Greg Mortensons Three Cups of Tea and facilitated new training and educational opportunities for women. But the current administration, despite its female secretary of State and its new Office of Global Womens Issues, appears to be ditching the women of Afghanistan like a blind date gone bad. You have to go back 10 months to find any sustained rhetoric from President Barack Obama about the importance of assuring the security of women in Afghanistan. Since then, and especially since last years Afghan election, those fine words from a sitting president have all but disappeared. Many of the fine actions are gone, too. Push local shuras into including women in 2002? Yes. Push local shuras into including women in 2010? Forget it. Its not difficult to understand why. Afghanistan is in crisis. The cynical policies that characterized the early to mid-stages of the occupation have come home to roost. President Hamid Karzai and his rogues gallery of kleptocrats, human rights abusers, and drug lords are hanging onto power even as Karzai declares open season on the United Nations by accusing senior bureaucrats of organizing the widespread voter fraud that consolidated his own hold on power. In the meantime, women have taken a back seat to realpolitik and the exigencies of a coalition exit strategy. But their suffering is real, as Afghanistans poverty and chaos affect women possibly most of all. Matemal mortality in Afghanistan still makes the worlds top three list, nine years after the U.S. invasion, resulting in a life expectancy for women of 46. In the countryside, Taliban zealots spray acid into girls faces for going to school -- and only 27 percent of them do so in the first place. According to a recent survey by the U.N. Development Fund for Women, 87 percent of Afghan women report being beaten on a regular basis. In July of last year, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a report that represents the most stinging official condemnation of the Karzai administrations abysmal track record on women to date. The report concluded, \The current reality is that ... women are denied their most fundamental human rights and risk further violence in the course of seeking justice for crimes perpetrated against them.\ Last year Karzai pardoned well-connected political thugs who -- before witnesses -- gang-raped a woman with a bayonet. Her husband, who had battled for redress, was assassinated soon thereafter. Women who dare to speak out against the widespread trampling of their rights face almost certain death while their murderers face 100 percent impunity. For the warlords and mujahideen that make up the upper echelons of the Karzai government, the issue of gender equality was always an unwanted appendage to U.S. involvement -- but one that could easily be dispensed with through the deployment of flowery speeches and the token appointment of a lone female minister to the Ministry of Womens Affairs. Indeed, just before his recent \election,\ Karzai felt secure enough to sign into law a series of repressive measures designed to repeal what minimal gains women have made since the Taliban ouster. Although eventually forced to back down over legislation that allows Shiite husbands to rape their wives, Karzai successfully signed into law other legislation that denies or severely limits womens rights to inherit, divorce, or have guardianship of their own children. The Shiite Personal Status Law also legalizes forced marriage and the rape of minors. It allows men to exert almost total control over female relatives and offers them the power to prohibit womens access to work, education, and health care by denying them the right to leave their homes except for \legitimate\ purposes. Even Karzais own wife -- a doctor whose skills are desperately needed -- is strictly sequestered. And if this sounds bad, just wait until the Americans leave. This is not just about women. Gender inequality not only affects girls and women, but boys and men. In Afghanistan, because women are rarely able to leave the house, very young boys are often forced to carry an unwarranted amount of financial responsibility, something that limits their prospects as well. Nor is it even just about Afghanistan. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in March, \The subjugation of women is a threat to the national security of the United States.\ On a geopolitical level, Valeries research has found that states with higher levels of violence against women are also less peaceful internationally. Indeed, violence against women is a better predictor of bellicosity than level of democracy, level of wealth, or presence of Islamic civilization. In a 2010 study, Valerie, along with Brad Thayer, also found high levels of gender inequality to be a strong aggravating factor in the development of Islamic suicide terrorism. So, given the desperate need of Afghanistans women and the serious consequences worldwide, why arent we doing more to help? One reason is the fallacious notion, common among coalition members, that Afghan \culture\ does not allow for gender equality and that forcing the issue will undermine Western interests. Pat heard this openly from one coalition representative, who prefers to remain anonymous: There is no point in pushing gender equality. It will only alienate them [Afghans].\ Of course, \them\ here refers only to men. But decision-makers forget that culture is not fixed, but is highly mutable and dynamic. More than 30 years ago, Afghan women were attending universities, teaching, working as doctors, nurses, and professors. Far from being a black hole of gender apartheid, Afghanistan, though impoverished, was more progressive than many of its Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, many young Afghans are open to new ways of doing things. In 2009, hundreds of Afghan men and women bravely stood together in Kabul to protest Karzais support for a new and oppressive Shiite family law. If Americans assume that all Afghan men are Neanderthals incapable of sympathizing with the plight of their sisters, they are wrong. Another, more unmentionable reason may be the chauvinism that permeates Western military culture. U.S. military life, despite increasing female recruitment and even \female engagement teams,\ remains a bastion of masculinity, with little sensitivity toward questions of female rights. For military leadership and recruits alike, immured as they are in an almost exclusively male world, the complete absence of women from Afghanistans streets and villages elicited no comment from the Marines who surrounded Pat, though she as a woman noticed it immediately. And the ready availability of pornography on U.S. bases, coupled with seamier depictions of life in the West, not only damages prospects for gender equality but by extension, Western interests. As one young, well-educated 24-year-old Afghan male pointed out, \Your culture has no respect for women at all. Look at your pornography and the way you exploit women in ways that we cant even imagine. Do you call that progress?\ Added another Afghan USAID programmer working in Gardez, a man in his 50s who is the father of three girls, \It would be better for the coalition if they could figure out a way to limit this kind of material.\ We can do better -- much better. The Obama administration must instill in all military personnel and senior diplomats the necessity of fully protecting women's rights. Key to that is educating them about how gender equality furthers Western interests and security. The military should spend less time courting \moderate\ Taliban and more time showing Afghan community leaders how gender equality -- including female access to family planning methods -- will result in healthier families, lower maternal and child death rates, poverty alleviation, and greater self-determination. Gender should be included as a component in all governance training and should be placed front and center in the upcoming \peace jirga\ that will include the Taliban. Indeed, let half of the negotiating team representing the government and the coalition be female: yes, a full 50 percent. Women must also be represented in the government. As Melanne Verveer, U.S. ambassador at large for global women's issues, noted last summer, speaking of female politicians in Afghanistan, \There is only one minister in the cabinet, and she is powerless. There is a low percentage of women in the civil service. There is only one female governor, in Bamiyan.\ Obama must insist on important changes for women before we leave and make subsequent aid contingent upon maintenance of a strong presence for women in the Afghan government. Better yet, the coalition needs to support \regime change\ through the building of democratic institutions that will groom a moderate, educated middle class of young women and men to eventually take over. Over two-thirds of the Afghan population is under the age of 25, which is either a real opportunity for social change -- if they are educated and given a chance to shape their society in a progressive way -- or a major obstacle, if they find themselves without jobs, unable to marry, and burdened with retrograde attitudes of what it means to be male and female. We must hold Afghanistan responsible for its treaty obligations under the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAVV) and U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security. Afghanistan signed CEDAW without reservations (the United States interestingly, has not), and that means that it has committed to passing whatever legislation is necessary to implement the wide-ranging principles of gender equality enshrined in that treaty. This includes taking measures to ensure that women enjoy the same basic human rights and fundamental freedoms as men, having in place legal and judicial procedures to protect the rights of women, taking measures to eliminate sexist discrimination, and lastly, submitting national reports every four years to a U.N. advisory group of international experts, the CEDAW Committee, to ensure transparency on what measures the country has taken to implement the treaty's provisions. Unanimously adopted in 2000, UNSC 1325 marked the first time the Security Council recognized the disproportionate and unique impact of armed conflict on women and stressed the importance of their equal and full participation as active agents in peace and security. Needless to say, women do not currently enjoy the same fundamental freedoms as men, and indeed, with the passing of the Shiite family law, many are worse off than they were before. To change this, the coalition needs to stay in Afghanistan. Withdrawing at this critical juncture would doom Afghanistan and the entire region to instability and effectively consign one half of the population to premature death and an existence not fit for animals. We are creating a shameful American tradition of leaving women no better off (Afghanistan) -- or even much worse off (Iraq) -- than before U.S. troops intervened. On the basis of America's track record, women around the world should have no faith that U.S. soldiers will improve their security. Despite Clinton's remarks on the link between gender equality and security, on the ground Americans act as if women's well-being, in the end, is not more than peripherally related to the issue of peace. As we have seen, this view could not be more wrong. Verveer's benchmarks concerning Afghanistan are the right ones: \Progress in Afghanistan must be measured not just in military terms, but also in terms of social, political, and economic participation of women in rebuilding Afghanistan and in the safeguarding of their human rights.\ American women are right to ask why we are sending their sons and daughters to fight and die so that Afghan women can continue to be treated like an inferior subspecies of humanity. When you break faith with Afghan women, you break faith with American women. You also break faith with your reasons for being there in the first place. Save bio when you subscribe to FP.

C05765783	H: If Roubini is right, and he's been mostly right so far, one of the few, then without additional and large stimulus devoted to putting a floor on job loss, the pressure on protectionism will be far more intense. (Protectionism, by any name, should not be dismissed as a targeted tool in an ongoing policy to force China to revalue its currency. The US is not without means here.) The deficit will be high in any case and the Republicans will always attempt to exploit it no matter what its number. Whether another stimulus can pass Congress is another matter. Still, what matters in the short-run--and long-run--are achievable results. To most people, the deficit is an abstraction; employment and housing--and insecurity about both--are their vital, concrete and immediate issues.

Wrong. Conditions in the U.S. labor markets are awful and worsening. While the official unemployment rate is already 10.2% and another 200,000 jobs were lost in October, when you include discouraged workers and partially employed workers the figure is a whopping 17.5%. While losing 200,000 jobs per month is better than the 700,000 jobs lost in January, current job losses still average more than the per month rate of 150,000 during the last recession. Also, remember: The last recession ended in November 2001, but job losses continued for more than a year and half until June of 2003; ditto for the 1990-91 recession. So we can expect that job losses will continue until the end of 2010 at the earliest. In other words, if you are unemployed and looking for work and just waiting for the economy to turn the corner, you had better hunker down. All the economic numbers suggest this will take a while. The jobs just are not coming back. There's really just one hope for our leaders to turn things around: a bold prescription that increases the fiscal stimulus with another round of labor-intensive, shovel-ready infrastructure projects, helps fiscally strapped state and local governments and provides a temporary tax credit to the private sector to hire more workers. Helping the unemployed just by extending unemployment benefits is necessary not sufficient; it leads to persistent unemployment rather than job creation. The long-term picture for workers and families is even worse than current job loss numbers alone would suggest. Now as a way of sharing the pain, many firms are telling their workers to cut hours, take furloughs and accept lower wages. Specifically, that fall in hours worked is equivalent to another 3 million full time jobs lost on top of the 7.5 million jobs formally lost. This is very bad news but we must face facts. Many of the lost jobs are gone forever, including construction jobs, finance jobs and manufacturing jobs. Recent studies suggest that a quarter of U.S. jobs are fully out-sourceable over time to other countries. Other measures tell the same ugly story: The average length of unemployment is at an all time high; the ratio of job applicants to vacancies is 6 to 1; initial claims are down but continued claims are very high and now millions of unemployed are resorting to the exceptional extended unemployment benefits programs and are staying in them longer. Based on my best judgment, it is most likely that the unemployment rate will peak close to 11% and will remain at a very high level for two years or more. The weakness in labor markets and the sharp fall in labor income ensure a weak recovery of private consumption and an anemic recovery of the economy, and increases the risk of a double dip recession. As a result of these terribly weak labor markets, we can expect weak recovery of consumption and economic growth; larger budget deficits; greater delinquencies in residential and commercial real estate and greater fall in home and commercial real estate prices; greater losses for banks and financial institutions on residential and commercial real estate mortgages, and in credit cards, auto loans and student loans and thus a greater rate of failures of banks; and greater protectionist,pressures. The damage will be extensive and severe unless bold policy action is undertaken now.

C05769439	NEA is asking for a statement from you on the sentencing of Syrian human rights activists. White House released a statement on this. Draft below: Statement by Secretary Clinton Syrian Convictions of Human Rights Activists The sentencing of Syrian lawyer Haitham Maleh to three years in prison is an example of Syria's failure to comply with minimum international human rights standards. Convicting Maleh for exercising free speech and defending universal human rights sends a clear message to the world that Syria does not tolerate peaceful forms of expression. We call on the Syrian government to meet its responsibilities under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It should demonstrate its commitment to international legal norms by releasing Maleh and other Syrian citizens, including Muhannad al-Hassani and Ali Abdullah, who have been imprisoned solely for seeking to exercise their most fundamental human rights. ###
C05770568	You may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel. His political views may be ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political opinions has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the US, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent one internationally. It is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred for his political views, after all. This story is splashed across the European press this morning. Not what anyone needs, yes, yes, like a hole in the head, and bone stupid, but the US effort on his behalf to gain entry should be part of the story. This incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the future. This is a downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S 14 16, 2010, 11:01 pm Chomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel By ROBERT MACKEY Noam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West Bank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to deliver a lecture. Amira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported: No reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby Bridge border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit Israel. Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank on Monday. A spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters that there had been a misunderstanding and \officials were trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to enter.\ In a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, \the facts were completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding.\ He explained that he was interrogated for several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-year- old scholar added: I can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he was receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was that the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose every other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an invitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past but not this time. Mr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at the Palestinian university in Ramallah. The renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, which ended in January 2009 and has criticized Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory many times. In an interview with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr. Chomsky said, \I objected to the founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I dont think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is a proper concept. I would object to the United States as a Christian state.\ When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on his opposition to Israel, saying, \Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating Jew,\ he replied: It is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. Its grotesque. If an Italian criticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian? • Copyright 2010 The New York Times Company • Privacy Policy • NYTimes.com 620 Eighth Avenue New York, NY 10018

On the planning side, thanks to the 2010 look ahead memos that the bureaus prepared for you, we will be more effective in creating media and outreach opportunities because our focus will be not just on this week, but looking ahead to the month and quarter as well. We have been briefing-centric in the past. We will be creating more channels to communicate our messages. I know Judith spoke with you on Monday about greater emphasis on international media. We will be restructuring part of my operation to be able to do that. Going through these issues, Ill either be well-rested or exhausted, but I am looking forward to 2010. PJ

Clinton was in San Diego for his annual Clinton Global Initiative University Meeting. The uprising in Libya stared in February during a wave of social and political unrest in the Middle East. Fighting has escalated all across the country, but the rebels have found themselves outgunned by Libyan leader Col. Moamrnar Gadhafis forces, which are better equipped. Last month the United Nations authorized a no-fly zone over the North African nation to prevent further attacks on civilians from Gadhafiss troops in the air. Clinton on Arming Rebels: I Sure Wouldnt Shut the Door to It The United States backed the no-fly zone and has also authorized additional support for the anti-Gad hafi fighters, but key U.S. lawmakers and top officials in the government of President Barack Obanaa have said they are not comfortable with arming the rebels -- apparently because not enough is known about then But Clinton said he wouldnt completely rule out the idea of supplying arms to Libyas rebels.

C05769993	Overall the speech is worth reading; if you like Ill have it put in your weekend book. 2 passages particularly worth noting. 1. \Across the Atlantic, Hilary Clinton has pledged to put women 'front and center' of the American development agenda. That is the right choice. As David Cameron and Jeff Sachs argued earlier this year, women can hold the key to development in the world's poorest countries — in education, enterprise, micro-finance and healthcare. Investing in women pays dividends throughout the entire community.\ 2. \I see DFID as a key, joined-up, integrated department, a bright star in the Whitehall constellation, a department of state for development in the developing world. That's why DFID has a seat at the Cabinet table and it's why I won't be satisfied until our message rings down the corridors of each and every department in Whitehall.\ We obviously dont love the \dept of state for development language,\ but what is most noteworthy is his emphasis on \joined-up\ and \integrated\ dept — underlining the fact that DFID as a separate cabinet department has been almost divorced from the rest of the government.

C05760248	Pis read the following. Ive followed this case Torture on homefront cries out for justice Comments <http://www.suntimes.com/news/marin/1734591,CST-EDT-caro126.article> August 26, 2009 BY CAROL MARIN <mailto:cmarin@suntimes.com> Sun-Times Columnist The feds cant -- just yet -- deport Michigan restaurateur Ibrahim Parlak to his native Turkey. But they are frighteningly closer. And the irony screams out. Carol Mann On Monday, the same day Eric Holder, President Obamas attorney general, announced he would appoint a special counsel to investigate whether torture was used by the CIA to extract confessions from foreign suspects, a U.S. appeals court at the behest of the U.S. government ruled that it didnt have a problem sending Parlak back to the country where he was tortured -- imprisoned for 17 months, shocked with electrodes, hung by his arms and sexually violated. A Turkish Kurd, Parlak was granted political asylum in 1992. It was before our government got cozier with Turkey, before it re-classified some of the Kurdish separatist movement as \terrorist\ and before the attacks of Sept. 11. With 9/11, Ibrahim Parlaks horror began anew. Suddenly he looked different to the newly created Department of Homeland Security and to the Justice Departments Immigration courts. Instead of seeing a hard-working, tax-paying Chamber of Commerce member who ran Cafe Gulistan, a small Middle Eastern restaurant in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., tlie feds now saw an international menace. In 2004, the FBI grabbed Parlak and locked him up. If it hadnt been for a volunteer team of lawyers, including a Reagan-appointed former U.S. attorney, a former FBI anti- terrorism legal adviser and the bipartisan intervention of Michigans Sen. Carl Levin, a liberal Democrat, and Rep. Fred Upton, a conservative Republican, Parlak would still be in jail. Thanks to them, this 47-year-old father of a 12-year-old girl is temporarily free. But just barely. The newest outrage is the 2-1 decision issued by Cincinnatis 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on the same day Holder launched his torture inquiry. B5 The majority opinion was issued by two Bush appointees put on the bench after 9/11. Judge Julia Smith Gibbons and Judge Jeffrey Sutton upheld the Justice Departments Immigration courts ruling that Parlak failed to disclose his relationship to the now-labeled terrorist organization even though he was never proven to be a member. Lets remember something about our immigration courts. They are not independent. They work for whoever is the attorney general. And the past rulings against Parlak came under two now-controversial Bush appointees, John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. The fairness of immigration rulings has been ripped by none other than Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the nations most brilliant judges. By September of 2005, Posner noted \a staggering 40 percent of the 136 petitions\ had been reversed due to, according to one ruling, a willingness to ignore \the most basic of facts.\ Echoing Posner now is the dissenting judge on the Parlak appeal. Judge Boyce F. Martin, a Carter appointee, writes with both clarity and conviction, arguing the governments \awesome power was used here to railroad a man out of our country.\ Like a surgeon, Martin dissects the Justice Departments immigration courts and the majority opinion of his own colleagues, and ends by saying, \I remain hopeful, nevertheless, that this case is but a sad remnant of an era of paranoid, overzealous, error-riddled and misguided anti-terrorism and immigration enforcement that has now gone by the wayside. It is just a shame that, even if my hope proves true, it is too late for Ibrahim Parlak.\ Parlaks legal team will appeal. Meanwhile, Holder, like Ashcroft and Gonzales before him, is the new boss of the immigration courts. As he investigates questions of U.S. torture abroad, heres hoping Holder examines the ongoing domestic legal torture of Ibrahim Parlak.

C05765650	ill Ex-Gates Foundation exec named foreign aid chief Obama administration picks former Gates Foundation official to run US foreign aid By MATTHEW LEE Associated Press ij 11-10-2009 13:46 11 SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Obama administration will nominate a young former executive with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to run America's top foreign assistance program, ending months of speculation and complaints about who would take the vacant post, U.S. officials said Tuesday. $ President Barack Obama has chosen Rajiv Shah, a medical doctor and currently a senior official at the Department of Agriculture dealing with food security, to run the U.S. Agency for International Development, the officials said. ¶ The officials spoke on condition of anonymity pending notification to Congress and a formal public announcement of the choice. 11 Shah's selection, which must still be confirmed by the Senate, would end a 10-month leadership vacuum at USAID, which has been operating with an acting director since Obama took office despite his campaign pledges to have the agency play a greater role in foreign policy. 11 Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton have said USAID is crucial to deploying their preferred \smart power\ foreign policy strategy, which envisions more equal roles for diplomacy and development alongside defense. They plan to double the amount of foreign aid. 11 The agency will play a key role in the administration's efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where officials believe the civilian component must be strengthened. $ But the top job at the agency has remained vacant until now, with several prime candidates' withdrawing from consideration amid a White House vetting process that Clinton denounced in July as \ridiculous,\ \a nightmare,\ and \frustrating beyond words.\ $ Shah, 36, whose family immigrated to the U.S. from India, is now the Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics and Chief Scientist at the Agriculture Department where he manages a budget of more than $2.6 billion and more than 10,000 staff around the world. ¶ Before that, he had several positions at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including managing its $1.5 billion contribution to a global vaccination fund and helping launch the foundation's Global Development program where he oversaw a $1.3 billion investment portfolio. The lingering USAID vacancy, particularly after several leading candidates pulled out, had upset development experts and Congress. Some lawmakers had suggested that Obama choose someone who had already gone through the vetting process. ¶ Shah fits that bill and has important political credentials, having worked with or for several leading Democratic politicians. il

C05765071	Madame Secretary: Thank you for reaching out to Secretary Solis and convincing her to join the Verification Commission. She and Ricardo Lagos will make for a very high profile and effective international component of the Commission. We will meet with her this morning at 10 am to brief her for Tuesday's journey to Honduras. At this point, it appears we have a military aircraft available. The plan is for the U.S. Delegation to depart D.C., stop in Miami to pick up Ricardo Lagos, and arrive in Tegucigalpa together. We think this will send a powerful message to Hondurans and leave no doubt about our commitment to seeing this process through to a successful conclusion. You should be aware that Ambassador Hugo Llorens is under public assault. The Wall Street Journal dedicates its America's column this morning to attacking him and calling for his removal. Last Friday, Representative Connie Mack did the same. This chorus will grow as the extent of our accomplishment is understood. Llorens is a tough, stalwart guy. He and his Mission have held firm during this crisis. A call from you would be a big boost. Finally, we will hold an IPC today to identify further steps. We will keep you up to date on these steps and identify further opportunities for your engagement. I want to thank you for your leadership and support during this long crisis. Your willingness to engage at key moments and take risks at the right time have propelled us much further than anyone expected. Your diplomacy prevented a debilitating civil conflict in Honduras that would have destabilized Central America and undermined two decades of our efforts. We now have a big opportunity in front of us, and for that we are grateful to you. Regards, Tom

C05739906	Statement on the Death of American Personnel in Benghazi, Libya It is with profound sadness that I share the news of the death of four American personnel, in Benghazi, Libya yesterday. Among them were United States Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Information Management Officer, Sean Smith. We are still making next of kin notifications for the other two individuals. Our hearts go out to all their families and colleagues. A 23. year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Stevens died last night from injuries he sustained in the attack on our office in Benghazi. I had the privilege of swearing in Chris for his post in Libya only a few months ago. He spoke eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the Libyan people. This assignment was only the latest in his more than two decades of dedication to advancing closer ties with the people of the Middle East and North Africa which began as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco. As the conflict in Libya unfolded, Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build the foundation for a new, free nation. He spent every day since helping to finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing America's values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in danger. Sean was a husband and a father of two, who joined the Department ten years ago. Like Chris, Sean was one of our best. All the Americans we lost in yesterday's attacks made the ultimate sacrifice. We condemn this vicious and violent attack that took their lives, which they had committed to helping the Libyan people reach for a better future. America's diplomats and development experts stand on the front lines every day for our country. We are honored by the service of each and every one of them. 1#tit U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2015-04841 Doc No. C05739906 Date: 05/13/2015 STATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.

C05766480	The team proposes to release the following statement under your name tomorrow I think it works. Please let me know what you think: Statement by the Secretary On the Restoration of Democratic and Constitutional Order In Honduras November 27, 2009 The United States remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization of American States. As part of that effort, it is essential for both parties in Honduras to implement the measures they agreed to in the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, including the formation of a government of unity and national reconciliation and the December 2 congressional vote on President Zelaya\s restitution. These are vital elements of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord, and the Honduran people and the international community expect an expeditious determination. We look forward to the Congressional deliberations getting underway as announced. The November 29 national elections are another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras. The electoral process -- launched well before June 28 and involving legitimate candidates representing parties with longstanding democratic traditions from a broad ideological spectrum -- is conducted under the stewardship of the non-partisan Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. The electoral renewal of presidential, congressional and mayoral mandates, enshrined in the Honduran constitution, is an inalienable expression of the sovereign will of the citizens of Honduras. We wish the Honduran people well as they choose their new leaders on Sunday, and we urge all sides to exercise their rights peacefully. The holding of a free, fair and transparent election is necessary but not sufficient for Honduras to reestablish the democratic and constitutional order. In order to help achieve that objective, we will continue, along with others in the region, to support the step-by-step implementation of the Tegucigalpa-San Jose Accord as a democratic way forward for the Honduran people. The president-elect who emerges from an election deemed free and fair will have a unique opportunity to promote that vital mission.

The New Republic was critical in undermining Carter when he pressed Begin Israeli intel used Ledeen and TNR to put out the stories on Billy Carter. But TNR is only one key being hit in the Wurlitzer. Heres one small but frank thing: Axelrod should not be a foreign policy spokesman on any issue or area. He has badly exacerbated this one. Many people in the press feel hes out of his lane and resent being lectured by him on foreq..3n policy. Foreign Policy magazine website has run a piece on this, reflecting widespread sentiment. (Ive enclosed this article bellow the TNR one below.) Id make Steinberg tell Donilon they need to rein in Axelrod. Axelrod has enough to do fixing the domestic messes hes made.

Yossi Klein Halevi 4. March 16, 2010 17:13 pm JERUSALEM—Suddenly, my city feels again like a war zone..Since the suicide bombings ended in 2005, life in Jerusalem has been for the most part relatively calm. The worst disruptions have been the traffic jams resulting from construction of a light rail. jUst like in a normal city. But navy, again, there are clusters of helmeted border nOtiCe near the gates of the Old City. black smoke from burning tires in the Arab village across from my porch, young men marching with green Islamist flags toward my neighborhood, ambulances parked at strategic places ready for this citys ultimate nightmare. The return of menace to Jerusalem is not because a mid-level bureaucrat announced stage four of a seven-stage process in the eventual construction oft,600 apartments in Ramat Shiomo. a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem. Such announcements and building projects have become so routine over the years that Paestinians have scarcely responded, let alone violently. In negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis, the permanence of Ramat Shiomo, and other Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, has been a given. Ramat Shlomo, located between the Jewish neighborhoods of French Hill and Rarrot, will remain within the boundaries of Israeli Jerusalem accord ng to every peace plan. Unlike the Snail Jewish enclaves inserted into Arab neighbochoocis, on which Israelis are strongly buliding in the established Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem defines the national consensus. Why, then, the outbreak of violence now? Why Harness \day of rage\ over Jerusalem and the Palestinian Authoritys call to gather on the Temple Mount to \save\ the Dome of the Rock from non-existent plans to build the Third Temple? Why the sudden outrage over rebuilding a synagogue, destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, in the Old Citys Jewish Quarter, when dozens of synagogues and yeshivas have been built in the quarter without incident? The answer lies not in Jerusalem but in Washington. By placing the issue of building in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem at the center of the peace process, President Obama has inadvertently challenged the Palestinians to do no less. Astonishingly. Obama is repeating the key tactical mistake of his failed efforts to restart Middle East peace talks over the last year. Though Oben-las insistence on a settlement freeze to help restart negotiations was legitimate, he went a step too far by including building in East Jerusalem. Every Israeli government over the last four decades has built in the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem; no government, let alone one headed by the Likud, could possibly agree to a freeze there. Obama made resumption of negotiations hostage to a demand that could not be met. The result was that Palestinian leaders were forced to adjust their demands accordingly. Obama is directly responsible for one of the most absurd turns in the history of Middle East negotiations. Though Palestinian leaders negotiated with Israeli governments that built extensively in the West Bank, they now refused to sit down with the first Israeli government to actually agree to a suspension of building. Obamas demand for a building freeze in Jerusalem led to a freeze in negotiations. Finally, after intensive efforts, the administration produced the pathetic achievement of \proximity talks\—setting Palestinian-Israeli negotiations back a generation, to the time when Palestinian leaders refused to sit at the same table with Israelis. That Obama could be guilty of such amateurishness was perhaps forgivable because he was, after ail, an amateur. But he has now taken his failed policy and intensified it. By demanding that Israel stop building in Ramat Shlomo and elsewhere in East Jerusalem—and placing that demand at the center of American-Israeli relations—hes ensured that the Palestinians wont show up even to proximity talks. This is no longer amateurishness; it is pique disguised as policy. Initially, when the announcement about building in Ramat Shlomo was made, Israelis shared Vice President Bidens humiliation and were outraged at their governments incompetence. The widespread sense here was that Netanyahu deserved the administrations condemnation, not because of what he did but because of what he didnt do: He failed to convey to all parts of his government the need for caution during Bidens visit, symptomatic of his chaotic style of governing generally. But not even the opposition accused Netanyahu of a deliberate provocation. These are not the days of Yitzhak Shamir, the former Israeli prime minister who used to greet a visit from Secretary of State James Baker with an announcement of the creation of another West Bank settlement. Netanyahu has placed the need for strategic cooperation with the U.S. on the Iranian threat ahead of the right-wing political agenda. Thats why he included the Labor Party into his coalition, and why he accepted a two-state solution—an historic achievement that set the Likud, however reluctantly, within the mainstream consensus supporting Palestinian statehood. The last thing Netanyahu wanted was to embarrass Biden during his goodwill visit and trigger a clash with Obama over an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood. Nor is it likely that there was a deliberate provocation from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which runs the interior ministry that oversees building procedures. Shas, which supports peace talks and territorial compromise, is not a nationalist party. Its interest is providing housing for its constituents, like the future residents of Ramat Shlomo; provoking international incidents is not its style. Finally, the very ordinariness of the building procedure—the fact that construction in Jewish East Jerusalem is considered by Israelis routine—is perhaps the best proof that there was no intentional ambush of Biden. Apparently no one in the interior ministry could imagine that a long-term plan over Ramat Shiomo would sabotage a state visit. In turning an incident into a crisis, Obama has convinced many Israelis that he was merely seeking, a pretext to pick a fight with Israel. Netanyahu was inadvertently shabby; Obama, deliberately so. Ac.t,cording to a banner headline in the newspaper Maariv, senior Likud officials believe that Obamas goal is to topple the Netanyahu government, by encouraging those in the Labor Party who want to quit the coalition. The popular assumption is that Obama is seeking to prove his resolve as a leader by getting tough with Israel. Given his ineffectiveness against Iran and his tendency to violate his own self-imposed deadlines for sanctions, the Israeli public is not likely to be impressed. Indeed, Israelis initial anger at Netanyahu has turned to anger against Obama. According to an Israel Radio poll on March 16, 62 percent of Israelis blame the Obama administration for the crisis, while 20 percent blame Netanyahu. (Another 17 percent blame Shas leader Eli Yishai.) • In the last year, the administration has not once publicly condemned the Palestinians for lack of good faith—even though the Palestinian Authority media has, for example, been waging a months-long campaign denying the Jews historic roots in Jerusalem. Just after Biden left Ramailah, Palestinian officials held a ceremony naming a square in the city after a terrorist responsible for the massacre of 38 Israeli civilians. That too didnt merit an administration rebuke. Obamas one-sided public pressure against Israel could intensify the atmosphere of \open season\ against Israel internationally. Indeed, the European Union has reaffirmed it is linking improved economic relations with Israel to the resumption of the peace process—as if its Israel rather than the Palestinians that has refused to come to the table. If the administrations main tactical error in Middle East negotiating was emphasizing building in Jerusalem, its main strategic error was assuming that a two-state solution was within easy reach. Shortly after Obama took office, Rehm Emanuel vvas quoted in the Israeli press insisting that a Palestinian state would be created within Obamas first tent. instead, a year later, we are in the era of suspended proximity talks. Now the administration is demanding that Israel negotiate over final status issues in proximity talks as a way of convincing the Palestinians to agree to those talks--as if Israelis would agree to discuss the future of Jerusalem when Palestinian leaders refuse to even sit with them. To insist on the imminent possibility of a two-state solution requires amnesia. Bidens plea to Israelis to consider a withdrawal to an approximation of the 1967 borders in exchange for peace ignored the fact that Israel made that offer twice in the last decade: first, when Prime Minister Ehud Barak accepted the Clinton Proposals of December 2000, and then more recently when Prime Minister Ehud Olmert renewed the offer to Mahrnoud Abbas. Abbas, says Olmert, never replied. The reason for Palestinian rejection of a two-state solution is because a deal would require Palestinians to confine the return of the descendants of the 1948 refugees to Palestine rather than to Israel. That would prevent a two-state solution from devolving into a bi-national, one-state solution. Israels insistence on survival remains the obstacle to peace. To achieve eventual peace, the international community needs to pressure Palestinian leaders to forgo their claim to Haifa and Jaffa and confine their peoples right of return to a future Palestinian state--just as the Jews will need to forgo their claim to Hebron and Bethlehem and confine their peoples right of return to the state of Israel. That is the only possible deal: conceding my right of return to Greater Israel in exchange for your right of return to Greater Palestine. A majority of Israelis—along with the political system—has accepted that principle. On the Palestinian side, the political system has rejected it. In the absence of Palestinian willingness to compromise on the right of return, negotiations should not focus on a two- state solution but on more limited goals. There have been positive signs of change on the Palestinian side in the last few years. The rise of Hamas has created panic within Fatah, and the result is, for the first time, genuine security cooperation with Israel. Also, the emergence of Salem Fayyad as Palestinian prime minister marks a shift from ideological to pragmatic leadership (though Fayyad still lacks a power base). Finally, the West Bank economy is growing, thanks in part to Israels removal of dozens of roadblocks. The goal of negotiations at this point in the conflict should be to encourage those trends. But by focusing on building in Jerusalem, Obama has undermined that possibility too. To the fictitious notion of a peace process, Obama has now added the fiction of an intransigent Israel blocking the peace process. The administration, according to a report in the Israeli ne\Aispaper Yedito Aharonot, is making an even more insidious accusation against Israel. During his visit, wrote Yediot Aharanot, Bicien told Israeli leaders that their policies are endangering American lives in Afghanistan and Iraq. The report has been denied in the White House. Whether or not the remark was made, what is clear today in Jerusalem is that Obamas recklessness is endangering Israeli--and Palestinian-- lives. As I listen to police sirens outside my window, Obamas political Intifada against Netanyahu seems to be turning into a third intifada over Jerusalem.

Sid http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/03/14/the_petraeus_briefing_biden_s_embarrassment_is_not_the_whole_sto ry The Petraeus briefing: Bidens embarrassment is not the whole story Posted By Mark Perry 4Saturday, March 13, 2010 - On Jan. 16, two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti, a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command (responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East), arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The 33- slide, 45-minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen. The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel, that CENTCOMs mostly Arab constituency was losing faith in American promises, that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in the region, and that Mitchell himself was (as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it) \too old, too slow ... and too late.\ The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented. No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on what is essentially a political issue; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed from a December 2009 tour of the region where, on Petraeuss instructions, they spoke to senior Arab leaders. \Everywhere they went, the message was pretty humbling,\ a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says. \America was not only viewed as weak, but its military posture in the region was eroding.\ But Petraeus wasnt finished: two days after the Mullen briefing, Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza (which, with Israel, is a part of the European Command -- or EUCOM), be made a part of his area of operations. Petraeuss reason was straightforward: with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab leaders as engaged in the regions most troublesome conflict. [UPDATE: A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House. \CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue, and CENTCOM did propose a UCP change, but to CJCS, not to the WH,\ the officer said via email. \GEN Petraeus was not certain what might have been conveyed to the WH (if anything) from that brief to CJCS.\ (UCP means \unified combatant command,\ like CENTCOM; CJCS refers to Mullen; and WH is the White House.)] The Mullen briefing and Petraeuss request hit the White House like a bombshell. While Petraeuss request that CENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied (\it was dead on arrival,\ a Pentagon officer confirms), the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts -- pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue, sending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the chief of the Israeli General Staff, Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi. While the American press speculated that Mullens trip focused on Iran, the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt, and tough, message on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: that Israel had to see its conflict with the Palestinians \in a larger, regional, context\ -- as having a direct impact on Americas status in the region. Certainly, it was thought, Israel would get the message. Israel didnt. When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu government was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, the administration reacted. But no one was more outraged than Biden who, according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, engaged in a private, and angry, exchange with the Israeli Prime Minister. Not surprisingly, what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to Petraeuss Mullen briefing: \This is starting to get dangerous for us,\ Biden reportedly told Netanyahu. \What you're doing here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. That endangers us and it endangers regional peace.\ Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report: \The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel's actions and US policy, any decision about construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism.\ The message couldnt be plainer: Israels intransigence could cost American lives. There are important and powerful lobbies in America: the NRA, the American Medical Association, the lawyers -- and the Israeli lobby. But no lobby is as important, or as powerful, as the U.S. military. While commentators and pundits might reflect that Joe Bidens trip to Israel has forever shifted Americas relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region, the real break came in January, when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning: Americas relationship with Israel is important, but not as important as the lives of Americas soldiers. Maybe Israel gets the message now. Mark Perrys newest book is Talking To Terrorists http://warincontext.org/2olo/o3/14/israel-is-putting-american-liyes-at-risk/ My piece on the briefing of Admiral Mullen by CENTCOM senior officers has occasioned a great deal of comment, as well as some skepticism: how accurate is the account? Was it told to me by direct participants in the briefing? Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda, whether that is a desire to expand CENTCOM — or even hostility towards Israel. I wont name my sources, even though its clear to people in the Pentagon — and certainly to General Petraeus — who they are. Was I told of the briefing by the briefers themselves? I will only say that there were four people in the briefing — the two briefers, Admiral Mullen, and Admiral Mullens primary adviser on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I know two of the people involved in the briefing. Whether or not they are my sources is something for the reader to determine. The account is not only accurate, its a precis of what actually happened. There is a lot more to it. The White House, State Department and Pentagon have not denied the account, and for good reason: its true. Is there any basis for imagining that Petraeus has any kind of hidden agenda in ordering the briefing? I have been reporting on the American military for thirty years. My work on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Four Stars, is the authoritative account on the subject. I have deeply rooted contacts in the military that go back thirty years. I have never met a senior military officer whom I do not admire. There is no greater insult than to believe that General Petraeus or any other senior American military officer would use the lives of American soldiers as a lever to enhance their own political future. My sense is that General Petraeus neither likes nor dislikes Israel: but he loves his country and he wants to protect our soldiers. The current crisis in American relations with Israel is not a litmus test of General Petraeuss loyalty to Israel, but of his, and our, concern for those Americans in uniform in the Middle East. It is, perhaps, a sign of the depth of \the Biden crisis\ that every controversy of this type seems to get translated into whether or not America and its leaders are committed to Israels security. This isnt about Israels security, its about our security. http://maxblumenthal.com/2010/03/pastor-hagee-and- netanyahus-lovefest-on-eve-of-bidens-arrival-in-israel/ Netanyahu and Pastor Hagees Lovefest on Eve of Bidens Arrival in Israel On 03.09.10, By Max (Videos recorded by Rachel Tabachnick; more videos coming shortly.) Vice President Joe Biden was greeted in Jerusalem with the announcement that the Israeli Interior Ministry approved the construction of 1600 new homes in Occupied East Jerusalem contrary to U.S. wishes and complicating Bidens mission to help jump start the peace process. But Biden should have known that Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu intended to upset his plans by Netanyahus appearance with John Hagee. The day after a series of talks between US Special Envoy for the Middle East George Mitchell and Netanyahu, and a day before Bidens arrival, Netanyahu appeared onstage with Pastor John Hagee in Jerusalem. The occasion was Hagees Night To Honor Israel, an event the far-right Texas-based preacher arranged to tout his ministrys millions in donations to Israeli organizations and to level bellicose rhetoric against Israels perceived enemies. At the gathering, Hagee called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \the Hitler of the Middle East\ and denounced the Goldstone Report as \character assassination by an unbiased and uninformed committee.\ Netanyahu welcomed the crowd of 1000 American evangelicals to Jerusalem, a city he described as \the undivided, eternal capitol of the Jewish people. Then, he told them, \I salute you! The Jewish people salute you!\ He used the rest of his speech to call for \tough, biting sanctions\ against Iran that \bite deep into its energy sector.\ Hagee and Netanyahu appear together on stage: r-- X In the audience were top-level members of the Israeli government, from Ambassador Michael Oren to Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat to Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon. Also present was Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of the illegal West Bank settlement of Efrat who gained notoriety for lobbying President Bill Clinton to pardon his friend, fugitive billionaire Marc Rich. Ayalon had stirred controversy days before when he refused to meet with a US congressional delegation brought to Israel by the progressive Jewish group J Street. Part One of Hagees speech: X Part Two. X Pastor Hagee in Jerusalem 3/8/10 (Part II) from Max J Blumenthal on Vimeo. Hagees ceremony featured a 15-minute film highlighting the recipients of donations from John Hagee Ministries that totaled $58 million since 2001. The recipients included Jewish settlements from the West Bank like Gush Etzion and Shomron, which was involved in promoting an \Obama Hilltop project\ that promoted more settlement building and compared Obama to Pharoah. Hagee also announced funding for a pressure group run by the settlers evacuated from Gush Katif in Gaza in 2005. During Israels assault on Gaza in 2009, a group of Gush Katif residents lobbied the Israel government to allow them to resettle the Palestinian coastal region. Who is Hagee funding in Israel? X Who Is Haoee Funding In Israel? from Max Blumenthal on Vimeo. The most notable of Hagees funding recipients was an organization called Im Tirtzu. A student representative of this group appeared in the film to thank Hagee for \help[ing] us to ensure that students in Israel are on the right path, the path of Zionism, the love of Israel, the path of solidarity.\ Another student called for \the second revolution in Israel.\ In February, Im Tirtzu funding a smear campaign against former Knesset member and New Israel Fund Director Naomi Chazan that included posters caricaturing her with a horn on her head. The group misleadingly accused the New Israel Fund of bankrolling 16 human rights organizations that contributed documentation to the Goldstone Report. The smear campaign led to unsuccessful legislation in the Knesset designed to further cripple already marginalized Israeli human rights groups. Meanwhile, the Jerusalem Post fired Chazan as a columnist without explanation. Gideon Levy, a columnist for Haaretz, called Im Tirtzu \a McCarthyite movement\ for its attacks on Chazan. Although CUFI attempted to distance itself from Im Tirtzus campaign, the organizations appearance during CUFIs Jerusalem ceremony suggested that Hagee would continue to provide it with funding well into the future. Republican Senator John McCain repudiated the endorsement of Hagee during his 2008 presidential campaign after Hagees statements describing the Holocaust as a fulfillment of divine prophecy came to light. Hagee has also said that he believed the anti-Christ was \partially Jewish, as was Adolph Hitler.\ However, none of Hagees comments have deterred Israeli government officials from embracing him or accepting his millions in annual charity. During Hagees speech, he made no secret of his support for the illegal settlement enterprise that has been the source of difficulties between the US and Israel. \The settlements are not the problem,\ he boomed from the podium. \The problem is the refusal of Arab leaders to respect the right of Jewish people to live anywhere in the Middle East.\ Hagee received a rousing ovation from the crowd and the Israeli government officials seated beside the podium when he proclaimed, \World leaders do not have the authority to tell Israel and the Jewish people what they can and cannot do in the city of Jerusalem. They don't have the authority to tell them what they can and cannot build, who can and and cannot live there.\ The following day, on March 9, Vice President Joseph Biden arrived in Israel to meet with Netanyahu and officials from the Palestinian Authority. He told reporters after touching down that he saw \a moment of real opportunity.\
C05772715	Declan, Thanks for your email. Of course its not personal. But I do think its wrong. When we were in Government we believed we could only succeed if we treated Northern Ireland as a bi-partisan issue and I encouraged other Governments to adopt the same approach. That meant when President Bush was in the White House, I went out of my way always to see and brief Democrats - in Congress and in the Senate - whenever I came to the States. It also meant when we held the first economic conference led by Mayor Bloomberg in Belfast, the dinner we gave at Hillsborough was not restricted to just those in respective Governments. In respect of how we handled the issue within the UK, that didnt mean I invited the Shadow Secretary of State to share every platform, but the Shadow was not excluded from being at major events. Indeed we made a point of not only saying we were bi-partisan, but acted accordingly. Having brokered the Hillsborough Agreement and having discussed with your Secretary of State - at all stages - how the US could help through an Economic Conference, I am obviously somewhat disappointed not to have been invited to attend the Conference in any capacity. That of course should never be confused with my deep respect and adMiration for Secretary Clinton. Frankly without her help during her time in the White House, as a Senator, as a candidate and now as Secretary, we could never have made the progress we did. You will know that, at the time, I was always disappointed that her contribution to the peace process and political process was not recognized appropriately by the Conservative Party and their spokesmen when they were in Opposition. The decision by Owen Patterson to decide not to be present at next weeks Conference is a matter for him and the political demands he has chosen on which to determine his priorities. You would not expect me to comment on his decision. However, I dont have to rehearse with you that successful long-term > Best, > Declan Forwarded Message

He seemed a) aware of the basis for what Id heard, b) to share my assessment/concern (though asked me to elaborate, which I did vividly), and c) prepared to make sure that whatever ready to be is said publicly - and whatever happens diplomatically - put the kibosh on the version as it came to me. Incidentally, unbidden by me on both points-i.e., volunteering-he went out of his way to says upbeat things about you and downbeat things about OMF. Said he wanted to discuss that with me in person. I said nothing of substance, except always glad to talk. Over and out, tho would appreciate youre confirming receipt, since Im not ccing anyone on this. Cha-cha-cha (even though youre not going to Argentina-and rightly so).

C05768322	Madam Secretary, Jake asked me to send you a brief update on the effort to create an internal USG website for housing interagency information about the attitudes, concerns, and media habits of foreign audiences (following up on the memo INR sent to you on this subject in February). INR is working with the interagency to create six initial country pages (Indonesia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Yemen) on this website. In addition to background information about each country and its relationship with the United States, each page will focus on providing up to date information on how local audiences view the United States and an analysis of the mediums through which local audiences get their news. Pages will also include a list effective messaging themes that would resonate with target audiences in each country. In the coming weeks, INR will be receiving interagency feedback on these initial draft web pages, and will be seeking guidance as to which additional countries should be covered. The hope is that each page will evolve over time based on user feedback. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Thanks, Mike Michael H. Fuchs U.S. De artment of State

C05769258	Greetings from Nairobi. Im at the end of week-long trip to Kampala, Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been very productive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I know that there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach to CVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overall approach to strategic communications around the globe. As you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. To put it bluntly, we are in an \information war\ on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunities around the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of \consumer share of mind.\ Both our adversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways of communicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in some cases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by our adversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and written about the concept of \soldier diplomats\. In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of \diplomat soldiers\ to help us gain ground in this new war. While countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply the same level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive stories about the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions has diminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded to all the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field for AQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an \invader\. Before I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much more aggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our new regional PD DASs and PAOs in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will work with the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to request that you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilities in this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return. Finally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, which I think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within the Mission, but across all government agencies within particular countries. I will continue to update you as we move forward. Hope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC. JM

C05769152	Below is the Iran section of the chairs statement from Trieste. There is strong language on human rights; is that what Miliband was referring to? The language on the nuclear issue reflects where we were last summer -- still on the first track. Iran We are concerned about the aftermath of Iranian Presidential elections. We fully respect the sovereignty of Iran. At the same time, we deplore post-electoral violence, which led to the loss of lives of Iranian civilians. We express our solidarity with those who have suffered repression while peacefully demonstrating and urge Iran to respect fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression, as ensured by the international treaties it has ratified. The crisis should be settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law. We call on the Iranian government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process. We remain committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the issue of Irans nuclear program and support renewed efforts to that effect, such as the readiness of the U.S. to enter into direct talks and the invitation from China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States to Iran to restart negotiations, as well as the constructive involvement of other G8 partners in the process. We stress the need for unity of action on the basis of agreed policy. We sincerely hope that Iran will seize this opportunity to give diplomacy a chance to find a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. At the same time we remain deeply concerned over proliferation risks posed by Irans nuclear programme. We recognise that Iran has the right to a civilian nuclear programme, but that comes with the responsibility to restore confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. We strongly urge Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA and to comply with the relevant UNSC Resolutions. Our meeting on the margin of the United Nations General Assembly opening week next September, will be an occasion for the G8 to take stock of the situation.

C05775200	Diplomacy Before and After Conflict By Marc Grossman Conflict is a universal condition, older than diplomacy. While conflict is a constant in human history, the nature of armed conflict, and especially the nature of 21st-century warfare, has been transformed. General Rupert Smith identified these changes in his book The Utility of Force: \The ends for which we fight are changing; we fight amongst the people; our conflicts tend to be timeless; we fight so as not to lose the force; on each occasion new uses are found for old weapons; the sides are mostly non-state.\2 The nature of 21st-century diplomacy is also changing. To be successful, diplomats must simultaneously shape, act upon, and react to global challenges. As Hans Binnendijk and Richard Kugler of the National Defense University argue, no single problem, danger, or threat holds the key to the worlds future. What matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our responses.3 The definition of victory, too, is different today. Twenty-first-century national security success will encompass a comprehensive definition of security, and will be achieved by the broadest simultaneous application of all elements of national power. This is the key to understanding Philip Bobbitts concept of \preclusive victory,\ which he describes as \anticipatory, precautionary attention to possible futures,\ requiring an expansive and integrated approach to modern diplomacy, defense, and development. A diplomatic strategy designed to produce preclusive victory will include conflict prevention, successful negotiation, deterrence, the preparation for conflict should all else fail, and efforts to establish order, ensure stability, and promote political and economic pluralism after conflict. Diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and its aftermath. The conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the State Department from 1993 to 1997 as the Departments Executive Secretary and U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. Postconflict diplomacy was a defining issue of the last third of my career at State as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs and as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 2001 to 2005. I have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy, the methods and goals needed to prevent conflict, diplomacys role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable, and the contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict. Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention Thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners, we can now make better use of the methods and theory of conflict prevention. The United States Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars are two among many institutions that have taken a leadership role in these efforts. Michael Lund, a practitionerscholar, notes that the present uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted international conflict prevention regime or system of governance—that is, of agreed upon arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated, functional responsibilities are assigned, norms and procedures are formulated, and actors are held accountable for their responsibilities. He asks the crucial question to all those who seek to \coordinate and rationalize\ a system of preventive diplomacy: where should responsibility for the tasks of preventive action be located—early warning, the decision to act, the formulation of a response, or the provision of bureaucratic and political support? Should it be horizontal, across different organizations or actors, or should it be vertical, up or down their chains of command?6 An example of conflict prevention that meets Lunds tests was the effort undertaken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in close collaboration with the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and supported by the United States, to avoid civil war in Macedonia in 2001. It is difficult now to recall that, until September 11, 2001, the possibility of civil war in Macedonia was a leading international headline. This successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable personal and institutional cooperation between the NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson and the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (and a former NATO Secretary General) Javier Solana. I spoke often during this period to Lord Robertson, Solana, and Ambassador James Pardew, whom President George W. Bush and Secretary Colin Powell appointed as the U.S. representative to the effort and who, along with Francois Leotard, the EU Special Envoy, played a crucial role in negotiating and implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement. As a direct participant, senior NATO official Mark Laity stated that there are insights about modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort, including the need for personal and institutional teamwork, the importance of early engagement in trying to head off violence, the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind (including 21st-century diplomats who can act \unconventionally\), and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate force quickly. Diplomacy When Conflict Is or Seems to Be Unavoidable When diplomacy fails to prevent conflict, the role of the diplomat changes. The new requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and imperative. The February 1999 diplomatic negotiations in Rambouillet, France, were designed to show the world that NATO and the Contact Group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using military force to stop Slobodan Milosevics attacks in Kosovo. I was in Rambouillet as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs to support Secretary Madeleine Albright. After the first day or so of the meeting, there was so much chaos that I urged Secretary Albright to depart Rambouillet and leave the \negotiating\ to those of us more junior. My strategy was that by not being present, the Secretary of State— and the administration—could keep a distance from an outcome that might be unacceptable to the United States. The Secretary had a different vision. Albright hoped Rambouillet would end the brutality against the Kosovars, but she was also prepared for the meeting to fail, and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be exhausted. Her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically, including her continued presence, so that if Rambouillet was a failure, there could be no further excuses against taking military action. Secretary of State James Baker had pursued a similar strategy before the first Gulf War in 1991. Baker relates in his memoirs, The Politics of Diplomacy, that President George H.W. Bush had concluded the United States should offer a meeting in Washington for Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz followed by a Baker trip to Baghdad to show Americas commitment to avoiding war if possible. Baker writes that he thought this proposal had three merits: it would give the administration one last diplomatic opening to avoid war; it would shore up domestic support for conflict; and it would show that, as the deadline for Iraqs withdrawal from Kuwait neared, the administration was doing something other than just preparing for war. The Presidents offer turned into the famous meeting between Baker and Aziz on January 9, 1991. As Baker recounts, \I was under no illusions. I assumed the talks would be unsuccessful and that within a matter of days, we would be at war.\8 In 2001-2003, the State Department leadership generally saw Iraq as a diversion from Afghanistan and not central to the war on terror. Saddam Hussein was a dictator and a menace— but \in a box,\ posing no immediate, direct threat to the United States; focus should be kept on defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and supporting the new Afghan government.9 Iraq had been a source of tension and disagreement inside the State Department since the beginning of the administration, and there were some who sought to move the policy from support for \smart\ United Nations (UN) sanctions toward an aggressive posture against Saddam. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in Years of Upheaval about the second term of the Nixon administration that State Department culture emphasizes negotiability, which is a consciousness of what the other side will accept. Kissinger did not consider this trait a particular positive at the time, and the departments culture of negotiability did not serve as a good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. If that was so during the period surrounding 1970s détente with Russia, diplomatic efforts with the Shah of Iran, and the crisis in the Middle East and the resulting 1973 war, this culture of negotiability no longer served as a good guide to institutional behavior for most of the senior State officials who participated in the interagency debate leading to the invasion of Iraq. We took part in planning for the conflict and its aftermath assuming—or hoping—that events either at home or abroad would turn preparations for conflict into successful coercive diplomacy rather than the military action that was ordered in the spring of 2003. The State Departments Director of Policy Planning, Richard Haass, observed that while he was \60:40 against going to war. . . no organization could function if people left every time they lost out on a 60:40 decision.\ Haass was operating under the belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; if he had known they did not, he says he would have been 90:10 against the war. And no senior Department of State officer resigned in protest. The department sought instead to try to recreate the successful Gulf War coalition of President George H.W. Bush and argued that the United States and its allies might compel Saddam to submit through a deployment of force in the region in early 2003. If this failed, there should be a sustained diplomatic effort to create a broad coalition to move militarily later in 2003. This possibility of a broad international coalition lost all relevance on January 20, 2003, when the French government announced that it would never support a second UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force in Iraq. Diplomacy in Preparation for Conflict Once conflict is inevitable or is initiated, one job of diplomats is to support military commanders in getting what they need to make conflict as short as possible, with the fewest casualties for Americans, allies, and civilians. This was the objective that the United States pursued in Turkey before the first Gulf War, which resulted in President Turgut Ozals support of American efforts. The diplomatic effort to prepare for conflict in Kosovo also involved the whole of the U.S. Government and the governments of the NATO Allies. To pursue a successful bombing campaign, diplomats in many NATO countries arranged for overflight and support for Allied forces. A similar effort by U.S. diplomats took place before the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. American and allied diplomats worked closely with nations surrounding Afghanistan, including forging contacts with Central Asian states on security issues for the first time in order to achieve transit, overflight, and bed-down rights for American and coalition forces before the October 7, 2001, beginning of action in Afghanistan. Before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, and especially after January 20, 2003, a similar effort began in earnest. Diplomats supported U.S. Central Command commander General Tommy Franks in order to make the war as short and successful as possible and to limit American, allied, and Iraqi civilian casualties. American diplomats worked with military commanders to seek access to facilities for U.S. forces and to participate in the public diplomacy effort to gain as much support as possible for the armed liberation of Iraq. American diplomats and Pentagon officials again paid particular attention to Turkey in an effort to convince the Turks to allow the 4th Infantry Division to transit that country to create a northern front in the battle against Saddams forces. Although the State Department worried about the size of the Department of Defense (DOD) request to Ankara, it worked closely with both civilian and military authorities at the Pentagon to try to meet the need that had been identified by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joint DOD—State diplomacy, however, could not overcome a negative vote in the Turkish parliament, which reflected strong public opposition to the war. The way the debate about using force is carried out inside the government influences attitudes and actions during and after conflict as well as future decisions on whether or not to use force. Military force may restore security, but it cannot resolve political or cultural sources of conflict. As Rupert Smith writes, \We are engaging in conflict for objectives that do not lead to a resolution of the matter directly by force of arms, since at all but the most basic tactical level our objectives tend to concern the intentions of the people and their leaders rather than their territory or forces.\ Smith argues that the civil-military structure designed to make political- military decisions is \deeply problematic\ and distorts decisionmaking in many ways.13 In his book, Smith imagines a debate between British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Ministry of Defense (MOD) officials about how to address the genocide taking place over a number of weeks in Rwanda during the summer of 1994. FCO: What can we do in the face of events in Rwanda? MOD: What do you want us to do? FCO: We ought to act. Something must be done. We cant have people being massacred. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council we cannot be seen to be doing nothing. MOD: So you want us to use military force? FCO: Yes. MOD: To do what? To stop the killing? FCO: Yes. Exactly. MOD: Who do you want us to fight? We are not clear who is doing the killing: is it tribe on tribe, or is it a force found _from a tribe? And Rwanda is a big country. Where do we start? Kigali, presumably, its the capital and we would want an airhead. FCO: Well, there must be an international force, of course. MOD: And what would be the British aim in joining the force? FCO: To play our part as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. MOD: Is Britain to lead the force? FCO: No, it should be led by the UN—a proper UN mission. MOD: That will take some time to assemble, so it will probably be too late to stop the killing. FCO: Then the mission should be aimed at bringing postconflict order. MOD: OK But we need to be clear how many British troops are currently available. Given our deployments in Ireland, Bosnia and a few other places, not many. FCO: What do you suggest? MOD: What are our governments priorities? Is contributing to this force a higher priority than these other tasks we are already undertaking? FCO: Probably not. MOD: In that case, these UN forces always lack expeditionary logistic support. And if we want to speed up the deployment of this force, offering a logistic unit would probably be the most valuable contribution. FCO: Will that put our soldiers at risk? MOD: Hardly any.\ Many American diplomats will recognize this imaginary conversation, having participated in something like it dozens of times since the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the American debate, the issue also quickly focuses on who pays the bills. It is worth stating, at least in the American case, that officials at the Pentagon and DOD often were legitimately frustrated by the State Department's inclination to promote military missions for the Pentagon and the Armed Forces in an increasing number of situations that were important, but not vital, to U.S. national interests. While this readiness to volunteer U.S. military forces to solve problems around the world was a direct result of the lack of civilian capacity to do the jobs required, it leads to understandable consternation among those in uniform. Diplomacy and Restoring Stability Following Conflict There are many issues—defeating extremism, promoting pluralism, bringing the benefits of globalization to those who have not yet benefited, living sustainably on the planet, nonproliferation— that will be part of any definition of successful 21st-century diplomacy. But getting postconflict diplomacy right—creating the conditions for a preclusive victory—may be the most crucial of all. This is not an easy assignment. The concept of success can be redefined after the fact, further complicating the assessment. Successful democratic governance and economic development cannot be delivered on a certain date, and therefore the need for time and patience is a necessity on the ground. However, patience is limited in home countries, and \fatigue\ often sets in. Thus, the potential for failure is high. Industrial war produced winners and losers; today's lines are not so clearly drawn, and the timeline may be longer. Rupert Smith again brings clarity to this assessment: We intervene in or even decide to escalate to, a conflict in order to establish a condition in which the political objective can be achieved by other means and in other ways. We seek to create a conceptual space for diplomacy, economic incentives, political pressure and other measures to create a desired political outcome of stability, and if possible democracy. . . . if a decisive strategic victory was the hallmark of interstate industrial war, establishing a condition may be deemed a hallmark of the new paradigm of war amongst the people.15 Smith's point can be pressed even further by recognizing the additional distinction between a military operation carried out following Smith's rules and the ambiguity inherent in trying to create the conditions Smith identifies as objectives. Christopher Schnaubelt has noted that a typical military operation will have unambiguous geographic boundaries (areas of responsibility) and will assign specific units to be responsible for every inch of ground or cubic foot of airspace. There is an obvious chain of responsibilities and expected actions between each individual Soldier or Marine on the ground and the commanding general. Nothing comparable exists for economic development in governance tasks, which tend to be assigned by function rather than local geography or rigid hierarchy of authority.16 Postconflict diplomacy was among the defining diplomatic issues of the last third of my career at the State Department. In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991, almost 500,000 Kurds fled to the mountains between Iraq and Turkey. Stranded in harsh conditions, they began to starve by the thousands each day. I was then the Deputy Chief of Mission in Turkey. Inspired by the leadership of Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, American diplomats, followed by American military forces and then an international coalition of governments and nongovernmental organizations, initiated Operation Provide Comfort (which became Operation Northern Watch). This was not just a \whole-of-government\ but a \whole-of-theinternational- community\ campaign to provide humanitarian assistance and then return the Kurds to their homes in Northern Iraq. Once home, they needed to be protected, and for 11 years, the United Sates and some of its allies, including Turkey, worked on the ground there to recreate a functioning society and then protected this area from Saddam by enforcing a no-fly zone. These years were also punctuated by activity in the Balkans. As Richard Holbrooke recounts, some of the pre-Dayton negotiations with Bosnian leader Alija Izetbegovi took place in my residence while I was Ambassador to Turkey:7 As one of Holbrooke's successors as Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, I watched the effort made by Ambassadors Robert Gelbard and James Dobbins to implement the Dayton Accords by applying whole-of-government efforts in postconflict post- Yugoslavia. I picked up the diplomatic thread again as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs promoting reconciliation, development, political progress, and nationbuilding in Kosovo. Other postconflict diplomacy efforts in Haiti, East Timor, and Liberia called upon the resources of the United States and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for development and sustained peace. The U.S. effort in Colombia, too, highlighted the need to focus on an integrated and cross-sectoral approach, which included disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict society. But the main events in modern diplomacy's postconflict paradigm are Afghanistan and Iraq. The key to understanding U.S. diplomacy in postconflict Afghanistan and Iraq is to recall the profound disagreement inside the U.S. Government, especially between DOD and State, about whether the United States should engage in \nationbuilding,\ a policy President Bush had campaigned against in 2000. State Department professionals were generally proud of the effort the United States had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping, supporting the deployment of U.S. military forces to participate, for example, in the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in East Timor, Haiti, and the Balkans. Most believed that nationbuilding, properly funded and executed, was an effective long-term tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the United States. The effort to create a new Afghan government after the overthrow of the Taliban was a piece of classical diplomacy carried out in the 21st-century context.'8 Secretary Powell directed Ambassador Dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the Germans in Bonn in 2001 to create a new Afghan government. To succeed, Dobbins worked with all the key players, including representatives from Iran, to support a major role for the United Nations and put Hamid Karzai in position to lead a new Afghanistan.' But, as Dobbins has written, the \Bush Administration, having overthrown the Taliban and installed a new government in Kabul, determined that American troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the Kabul city limits. Public security throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to Afghans, despite the fact that Afghanistan had no army and no police force.\2° The struggle over nationbuilding also hampered American attempts to get sufficient amounts of U.S. or international assistance to Afghanistan. Washington accepted the diffusion of responsibility there, with the British taking charge of counternarcotics, the Italians reforming the justice sector, and the Germans training police. This satisfied the need for burden-sharing but did not lead to success. In addition, postconflict resources focused by the United States on Afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations, even including Kosovo.' American diplomats who followed Dobbins to the Embassy in Kabul over the years faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment.22 The State Department participated at many levels in the National Security Council—led planning for postconflict Iraq. Much of the planning was detailed, but focused on lessons learned from the first Gulf War. The department's Future of Iraq Project, while important, would not have solved Iraq's postwar problems. State did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the immediate postconflict administration of Iraq, and its leadership agreed to the Executive order creating a postconflict Iraq structure that reported to the Secretary of Defense. There is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by others in the immediate postconflict period in Iraq, although Dobbins's argument that, looking back, the Coalition Provisional Authority accomplished a great deal under trying circumstances is worth noting.23 On July 1, 2004, the State Department did officially open (on time and on budget) an Embassy in Baghdad, which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more comprehensive senior civilian-military cooperation. There is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts: the need to have adequate civilian capacity to respond, including a role for a revitalized U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). As this journal chronicled in an article' by Ambassador John Herbst, the Secretary of State's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS), his office was mandated to develop a whole-ofgovernment civilian response to stability operations and to ensure civilian-military coordination. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) is in an early stage, and ultimately will be made up of a reserve component, in addition to the existing active and standby components. The personnel are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts: engineers, lawyers, judges, corrections officials, diplomats, development experts, public administrators, public health officials, city planners, border control officials, economists, and others. Currently, the active and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from State, USAID, and a core group of domestic U.S. Agencies. Once congressionally funded, the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments and the private sector. Between January 2008 and May 2009, 56 CRC members deployed to 11 countries, including Afghanistan for planning purposes, and there are realistic plans to have 250 active members and 1,000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010. There are now at least 14 other countries with whom the United States allies that have a civilian peacebuilding capacity—some including stability or civilian police, and employing wholeof- government or \comprehensive\ approaches similar to that created by Washington. Several, in fact, have higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than America's.25 One way for State to further support the S/CRS effort would be to consider creating a new personnel specialty: the \expeditionary diplomat.\ Washington's diplomatic personnel have, of course, always been in one sense expeditionary; the majority of the Foreign Service is deployed abroad the majority of the time. But the post-9/11 diplomatic experience, and especially the effort in Iraq and Afghanistan, means that State needs to be more explicit about the expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare a small but significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at a moment's notice. Experience with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq and Afghanistan, the lessons learned with S/CRS, and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest posts should lead State leadership to conclude that this is a step worth taking. The first requirement would be advanced training, some of it provided by DOD and some by the Central Intelligence Agency, for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special career path. These entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places, just as we now ask diplomats who take the hardest languages— Chinese or Arabic, for example—to serve more than one tour using their skills. Since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military, the State Department could allow people to opt in and out of this \special force\ during their careers as long as they have the proper training. This would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well. The department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for a career beyond the norm for Foreign Service and are promoted and rewarded. The creation of S/CRS is a symbol of the comprehensive, simultaneous diplomacy needed for the future, and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the State and USAID commitment to the civilian response capacity. There are still key questions to be answered about civilian capacity. In the face of a real world situation, will DOD really support a State Department—led operation? Will Congress adequately fund S/CRS, including a reasonable contingency fund? How will S/CRS and a resurgent USAID work together? Where will the lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding? There seems to be no question that the path is the right one, consistent with the administration's focus on diplomacy, development, and defense. Success will come with clear direction and active implementation. If we combine the observations made by several authors,' we arrive at this question: What national policies, supported by adequate human and financial resources, will create the conditions during and after war to bring about a preclusive victory? Nation building, post- conflict reconstruction and stability operations, and counterinsurgency strategy (call it what we will) will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come. Accomplishing this task does not have to be an exclusively American responsibility, and, indeed, one of the goals of modern American diplomats will be to make these efforts more international. But for the foreseeable future, the United States will need to learn the lessons of its role in nation building from Germany to Iraq.\ These lessons include support for new institutions that bring all of the elements of power and influence together in the same theater, at the same time, and in close coordination so the United States and its allies and friends have a chance to succeed.28 As Philip Bobbitt has written, \The problem is the picture of warfare to which we cling. This picture unfolds in this way: peace making by diplomats; war making by the Armed Forces; peace building by [US]AID and reconstruction personnel. The reality of 21st century warfare, however, is that all of these tasks must be performed simultaneously.\ While the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century can be observed and analyzed individually, none of them can be solved without reference to the others. Diplomacy is not the answer to every question, but it has utility both before and after conflict. As General Smith writes at the end of his volume: For the general purpose of all interventions is clear: we seek to establish in the minds of the people and their leaders that the ever present option of conflict is not the preferable course of action when in confrontation over some matter or another. This applies as much to the state possessing nuclear weapons or seeking to obtain them, rogue or otherwise, as it does to the * terrorist or the machete-wielding rebel; each is posing an armed threat to people to establish a condition in which to achieve its political goal. To do this, military force is a valid option, a lever of intervention and influence, as much as economic, political and diplomatic levers, but to be effective it must be applied as apart of a greater scheme focusing all measures on the one goal.3° The connection to the utility of a modern diplomacy is clear. Twenty-first-century diplomacy, working to prevent conflict, trying to get ready for it if it is inevitable, or dealing with the consequences, can be an effective tool of national security if it is adequately funded, carried out by well-trained, dedicated people, focused on clear goals set by national leaders, and backed by effective military force. This is the diplomacy of the future. The author expresses appreciation to The Cohen Group for allowing him time to consider these issues and to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Harvard John F. Kennedy School Project on Diplomacy for supporting the effort. The author also gratefully acknowledges the important contributions of Toni Getze, Jill ODonnell, and Daniel Bliss in making this article a reality.

C05770163	Madam Secretary, Following up on your trip to Ecuador, Jake asked me to send you a quick update on the Financial Action Task Forces (FATF) listing of Ecuador: (SBU) On June 25 the FATF moved Ecuador down a notch from a list of countries with serious strategic deficiencies in measures against money laundering and financing terrorism. Ecuador is now on the \Improving AML/CFT Compliance: On-going Process\ list for showing progress in its efforts against money laundering and financing terrorism. (SBU) According to Treasury, the change in Ecuadors status stems from its commitment to an action plan with the FATF, and the GOEs demonstrated high-level political commitment to work toward AML/CFT (anti-money laundering — combating the financing of terrorism) compliance. WHA is looking into options for next steps. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Best, Mike Michael H. Fuchs U.S. Department of State (202) 647-1709 (cell)

Additionally, Clinton said, the State Department would install on all diplomats' computers new software called CandorShield', which automatically translates truthful language into a less embarrassing truth-free version. For example, she explained, the software would translate the phrase \two-faced weasels\ into \trusted Pakistani allies\ and would delete all references to French President Nicolas Sarkozy as \Monsieur Shorty Pants.\ Elsewhere, Interpol issued this statement about its pursuit of WikiLea.ks founder Julian Assange: \We will find Julian Assange, and then we will hire him.

C05768939	FYI below on French statement on Haiti and U.S. support: Paris, January 19, 2010 COMMUNIQUE During their telephone conversation last week, the President of the Republic and President Obama expressed the resolute commitment of our two countries in Haiti, and decided to combine their efforts in order to deal with the urgent humanitarian situation and to respond, in the future, to the enormous reconstruction requirements. The French authorities have, since then, been entirely satisfied with the cooperation between our two countries and, beyond that, the continuous coordination between the Crises Centers of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs and the U.S. Department of State. They want to pay tribute to the United States' extraordinary mobilization efforts in support of Haiti and the vital role it is playing on the ground.

C05769834	Just FYI on the below, from one of those crazy right \magazines\ - notes that the home you referenced in your Prayer Breakfast remarks has since closed. I checked in with Lissa & Melanne, they didn't know it closed, which makes sense since it happened in 2002 after you left the White House. I made it clear that your longtime commitment to this issue - throughout your public career - is well known, and you remain very proud of your work with Mother Teresa in opening this home in 1995. And that your partnership is a success story to be emulated. Again, this is just FYI http://www.worldmag.com/webextra/16398 ADOPTION I Hillary Clinton continues to hail an adoption home she helped open with Mother Teresa that has since closed its doors By Emily Belz WASHINGTON—An adoption ministry Secretary of State Hillary Clinton hailed as a home she helped open with Mother Teresa no longer handles adoptions and its phone line has been disconnected, though at last week's National Prayer Breakfast Clinton spent five minutes of her 30-minute speech relating the story of its opening. Last Thursday Clinton described Mother Teresa \beaming about what this meant for children and their futures,\ seemingly oblivious that the Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children in northwest Washington, D.C., is now defunct. She said she worked tirelessly to \cut through all the red tape,\ although it appears that red tape prevented the work from continuing. According to a pastor at the church next door to the home's former location, the adoption ministry failed to take off because the Roman Catholic nuns who ran it weren't allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site. \Im not sure the legal thing that came down upon them, but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way,\ said Maureen Freshour, who along with her husband, David, pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby. Freshour has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington, where they are ministering to the homeless.\This has been a core issue—adoption—whether the home [Clinton] talked about survived or not,\ said Chuck Johnson, chief operating officer of the National Council for Adoption. \Its an issue shes been consistent on.\During her speech on Thursday, Clinton reminisced about the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast when she attended as first lady and Mother Teresa was the speaker. The Roman Catholic nun delivered a blistering speech about abortion, saying, \Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want.\ Mother Teresa then called on attendees to fight abortion through adoption: \Please dont kill the child. I want the child. Please give me the child.\The audience that day gave her a standing ovation—but President and Mrs. Clinton, both pro-abortion, did not stand. Afterward, Mother Teresa asked to meet with Hillary Clinton and they went to talk behind a curtain on the stage, sitting on folding chairs, Mother Teresa in sandals even though it was winter.\She told me that she knew that we had a shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies,\ Clinton related last Thursday. \And she asked me—or more properly, she directed me—to work with her to create a home for such babies here in Washington.\Clinton followed through and set up a home for unwanted babies in Washington in just over a year, no small feat in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy. The Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children opened in June 1995 in the district's affluent Chevy Chase neighborhood to house eight pregnant mothers and their babies—but it remains unclear whether it facilitated any adoptions.I called the Missionaries of Charity in Washington, a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa. The nun who answered the phone said she couldn't give her name because they aren't allowed to talk to the press. She did say, however, that the sisters who are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened, so she wasn't sure why it closed. She added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002. \We work with the poor and we didnt have any work there because its a rich neighborhood,\ she said. The sisters, she added, are now working with the homeless and those with AIDS in a more transitional neighborhood in the northeast section of town on Otis Street. ###
C05764524	Oops my email acting up. Eap is asking you to call Thai foreign minister kasit regarding the case of the russian arms dealer viktor bout. Are you ok doing this call in the next day or so? Below is call sheet and I also faxed to the house. Purpose of Call: To underscore the importance we place on a the Royal Thai Government's successful appeal of the court decision rejecting the extradition of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the United States and the importance of his continued detention pending the outcome of the appeal. Background: On August 11, 2009, a Thai judge denied a U.S. extradition request of accused arms smuggler Viktor Bout (pron: BOOT) to face trial in New York for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Thai Attorney General's Office will appeal the ruling. FM Kasit has been a strong ally on Burma and released a forward-leaning Chairman's statement on behalf of ASEAN following ASSK's conviction.

C05771504	. Subject: H: fyi, to discuss when you come up for air... Sid http://www.newsweek.com/2010/04/15/europe-s-new-politics-of-fear.print.html Europe's New Politics of Fear by Denis MacShaneApril 16, 2010 There is a new divide in Europe. Not an iron curtain, but an iron intolerance as politicians revert to blaming minorities for their nations' woes. In Western Europe it is Muslims. In Eastern Europe they are Jews, Roma, and gays. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders surged to an election victory in March on the back of anti-Muslim, anti-Quran populism. In Hungary the Fidesz Party won big in recent elections with attacks on \Jewish capital... which wants to devour the entire world.\ To the right of Fidesz is the openly anti-Jewish Jobbik Party, which won just two seats fewer than the Socialists. Its leaders want to wear the neo-Nazi uniform of the pre-1939 Hungarian Guard when they take their seats in Budapest's Parliament. Contemporary political scientists do not like to highlight anti-Semitism. They prefer the term \radical populism,\ but to anyone with half a sense of European history, the parallels with an older, Jew-baiting politics can no longer be dismissed. Economic dislocation and a rapid loss of confidence in traditional politics gave rise to ultranationalist movements in the first half of the last century. Now a global recession and the hunt for someone to blame as jobs and incomes disappear is producing the same toxic politics. The Fidesz leader, Viktor Orban, was a youthful evangelist for liberalized open markets after 1990. Now he strikes a much more nationalist tone. His Socialist opponents had to accept an austerity IMF package. Unlike Greece—which is being helped, so far, by its euro-zone partners—Hungary was alone as boom-time euro loans to buy houses and cars had to be paid back in an ever-devaluing forint. Blaming the Socialist government, globalization, and international capital was easy. But Fidesz went further. In a bid for votes on the far right, a Fidesz parliamentarian, Oszkar Molnar, says it's time to give \primacy to Hungarian interests over those of global capital, Jewish capital.\ Like Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in France, Jobbik has the support of about 15 percent of Hungarian voters. The Czech right-wing ODS Party has had to dismiss its leader, former premier Mirek Topolanek, after he attacked the Jewish origins of the current Czech prime minister and castigated the gay transport minister. In a new book, The Populist Radical Right in Poland, the Oxford-educated Warsaw political professor Rafal Pankowski writes: \Antisemitism is crucial to the Polish populist right. The number of Jews in Poland today is minimal, but the anti-Jewish prejudice serves as a code for a general hostility to diversity and to Polish [liberal] democracy.\ For the time being, criticism of nationalist politics is suspended as Poles mourn President Lech Kaczynski and other national leaders killed in the air-crash tragedy this month. But the record of his party activists—including Michal Kaminski, Poland's best-known M.E.P. and leader of a small right- wing group in the Strasbourg Parliament—is disturbing. An admirer of the late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Kaminski uses ugly language about gays, and says he will apologize for the killing of Jews on Polish soil in World War II when \Jews apologize for killing Poles.\ Mainstream political parties have sought to play down the rise of minority bashing. But Fidesz is affiliated with the center- right European People's Party, which groups Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany, Nicolas Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement government in France, and ruling conservative parties in Sweden, Italy, and Belgium. When Austrian rightist Jorg Haider entered a coalition in Austria a decade ago, the European Union held Vienna in a political quarantine until Haider was removed. But Fidesz has a massive majority built on attacking \Jewish capital\ in language even Haider didn't dare utter. So radical populism—anti-Muslim in Western Europe, anti-Jewish in Eastern Europe, and anti-foreigner and anti- immigrant rhetoric everywhere—is no longer fringe politics. In Britain's general election, all the main parties are seeking to appease anti-foreigner feeling with language on immigrants that they would not tolerate if applied to British citizens living and working abroad. Comparisons with prewar Europe should not be overdrawn. Fascism is dead and not coming back. But a new politics of intolerance is afoot in Europe, and no one knows how to deal with it. http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/05/how-marine-le-pen-is-changing-french-politics.print.html B6 Eit What a Tea Party Looks Like in Europe Marine Le Pen is moving her father's rabble-rousing, far-right party away from the fringe, and redefining French politics in the process. by Tracy McNicoll and Christopher DickeySeptember 05, 2010 amuel Bollendorff / The New York Times-Redux Marine Le Pen is the heir apparent to the leadership of the National Front, the right-wing party her father Jean-Marie (left) leads today Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 82-year-old firebrand of France's far right—the man who for decades has played on the inchoate fears, xenophobia, knee-jerk racism, and ill-disguised anti-Semitism of many of his supporters—had just finished speaking to the faithful on a farm not far from the English Channel. As members of the youth wing of his National Front party feasted on barbecue and apple pie, they were thrilled to see the grand old man hold forth, still the \provocateur\ taunting the establishment, the \toreador\ who hides the sword in his cape and lets the press run at him like a bull. Even these youngsters knew, however, that Jean-Marie's time in the ring is nearing an end. The old man himself made it clear he's. determined to step down. All eyes this day were on his daughter Marine. \She has the will, the courage, the temperament necessary, and the competence,\ Le Pen told reporters at the farmhouse. \It seems to me indisputable that she is our camps best candidate for 2012.\ Tall, blonde, plain-spoken, and thick-skinned, Le Pens youngest child, at 42, is the heir apparent to his party. Shes expected to win the contest for its leadership in January, and shes a passionate advocate of its core message: strong French nationalism, relentless Euro-skepticism, and a lot of hard-nosed talk about fighting crime and immigration. Shes a fresh face, a new look, and, with rising poll numbers placing her third in a crowded field of possible 2012 candidates, a new threat in French politics. In the eyes of many, shes more effective—and thus more dangerous—than her father. Its a measure of the Le Pens enhanced power that theyve managed to push President Nicolas Sarkozy to the right and cast their own party as mainstream. Over the summer, Sarkozy essentially gave up his flirtation with the left, which began after his election in 2007. He had cherry-picked popular Socialists for his centrist government, dividing their party. But in elections this past March, Sarkozys UMP party managed to keep control of only one out of 22 regional governments. So he decided to swing back to the right by playing on fears about public safety and immigration. He proposed taking citizenship away from some criminals of immigrant background and launched a campaign against Roma (or \Gypsies\), booting hundreds out of the country. While the measures proved popular in opinion polls, Sarkozy, ironically, did not. His abysmal approval ratings remain in the low 30s. The younger Le Pen takes great pleasure in watching Sarkozy squirm. \I think I get on [his] nerves quite a bit,\ she says. \My profile is much more complicated for him to deal with than that of my father.\ The old man could be painted as a creature of the past, a purveyor of old prejudices with a \sulfurous\ reputation, says Marine. Today, however, the Front wants to bill itself as \neither left nor right.\ If that means losing some fringe elements (many of whom support Marines rival, Bruno Gollnisch), well, \tent pis,\ she says. Other right-wing movements in Europe are also pushing into the political mainstream. The government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has long relied on its alliance with two groups that used to be considered extreme—one of them the former Fascist Party under Gianfranco Fini, the other the secessionist Northern League of Umberto Bossi. A falling-out between Berlusconi and Fini has left Bossi as the current kingmaker in Italian politics. In the Netherlands, the militantly Islamophobic Geert Wilders won enough seats in the last elections to become a pivotal figure in the drawn-out process of trying to build a new coalition government. Yet these movements often differ in significant ways from the right wing thats made in the U.S.A. Put aside the usual caricature of \people in pointy hoods and the Ku Klux Klan,\ Marine Le Pen says, and she still believes \the American right is much more to the right than the National Front.\ She might agree with those who want to manage American frontiers more effectively and prevent massive illegal immigration, but shes also a big believer in the states ability and obligation to help its people. \We feel the state should have the means to intervene,\ she says. \We are very attached to public services A la frangaise as a way to limit the inequalities among regions and among the French,\ including \access for all to the same level of health care.\ Le Pen grew up in a household that was all politics all the time, with her father the object of sometimes violent attacks by competing factions on the right, as well as by the left. When Marine was just 8, someone set off a 20-kilo bomb in the familys Paris apartment building. Miraculously, no one was killed or seriously injured, but the front of the building was brought down. The crime has never been solved. \The worst part wasnt just the attack, it was that not a single politician sent a word of condolence,\ she says. \It was difficult, but it builds character, it hardens you.\ That's a real asset in political life anywhere. If Sarkozy finds himself facing off against Marine Le Pen in the presidential race a year and a half from now, he may find himself wishing her old man had stayed around a little longer.

Challenger withdraws from race to unseat Afghan president KABUL (Reuters) — One of the top candidates expected to bid to unseat Afghan President Karzai withdrew abruptly from the election race, dealing a blow to opposition hopes of fielding a contender with a broad enough base to win. Gul Agha Sherzai, popular governor of Nangarhar Province and a former anti-Soviet guerrilla commander, had been in talks to head up a broad opposition ticket with two vice presidential candidates that would span ethnic lines. But he told a news conference that he had met Karzai and had been persuaded not to run.

At the moment, regional leaders are responding cautiously and the impact on other regional processes does not appear significant. The Armenian Ministry of Defense denied any unusual activity along the line of contact; the Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense told media that incidents are frequent along the line of contact. Embassy Yerevan reports that it is customary to deny reports of sniper incidents along the line of contact, but that an incident of this magnitude would be difficult to cover up. Embassy Baku notes that President Aliyev is in Kazakhstan and local authorities could be waiting for his return before deciding on how to proceed.

Then I decided to share it with you anyway for any value it has for you. Frame: The world we live in today is inextricably interconnected. Together we succeed. Apart we fail. In the Obama Administration, we will use smart power to advance to our shared security, shared prosperity and shared humanity. In advancing our shared security, we seek to: • Reduce threat of violent extremism • Reduce the spread of weapons of mass destruction In advancing our shared prosperity, we seek to: • Use development to create and sustain strong stable economies by: o Focusing on women as essential for driving economic growth; o Expanding access to food and the means to grow or buy it; and, o Expanding access to quality education in developing countries; • Expand access to stable, affordable and increasingly clean energy sources In advancing our shared humanity, we seek to: • Expand human rights and the conditions that promote respect for human rights • Support the development of health systems that support healthier societies and confront the spread of pandemic disease (e.g., AlDs) How we achieve these goals: We will advance these goals through shared responsibility and the application of smart power. America has the responsibility to lead, but can only lead in partnership with others. Smart power means elevating and integrating diplomacy and development. DIPLOMACY: Focus on priority partnerships: • Revitalized partnerships with historic allies EU, Japan, Korea, Australia; • Calibrated partnerships with China and Russia; 31 • Cultivated partnerships: Brazil, India, Turkey, Indonesia, and South Africa; • Targeted public/private and multilateral partnerships based upon the principles of variable geometry (Le., focused on the problem at hand).

C05765959	Cheryl Mills < Sunday, December 6, 2009 9:39 PM Fwd: Charles Blow in NYT today EF1 December 5, 2009 Op-Ed Columnist Black in the Age of Obama By CHARLES M. BLOW A hundred and fifty years ago, Charles Dickens opened \A Tale of Two Cities\ with the now-famous phrase: \It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ...\ Those words resonated with me recently while contemplating the impact of the Obama presidency on blacks in America. So far, its been mixed. Blacks are living a tale of two Americas — one of the ascension of the first black president with the cultural capital that accrues; the other of a collapsing quality of life and amplified racial tensions, while supporting a president who is loath to even acknowledge their pain, let alone commiserate in it. Last year, blacks dared to dream anew, envisioning a future in which Obamas election would be the catalyst for an era of prosperity and more racial harmony. Now that the elections afterglow has nearly faded, the hysteria of hope is being ground against the hard stone of reality. Things have not gotten better. In many ways, theyve gotten worse. The recession, for one, has dealt a particularly punishing and uneven hand to blacks. A May report from the Pew Research Center found that blacks were the most likely to get higher-priced subprime loans, leading to higher foreclosure rates. In fact, blacks have displaced Hispanics as the group with the lowest homeownership rates. According to the most recent jobs data, not only is the unemployment rate for blacks nearly twice that of whites, the gap in some important demographics has widened rapidly since Obama took office. The unemployment rate over that time for white college graduates under 24 years old grew by about 20 percent. For their black cohorts, the rate grew by about twice that much. And a report published last month by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2008, \food insecurity\ for American households had risen to record levels, with black children being the most likely to experience that food insecurity. Things on the racial front are just as bad. We are now inundated with examples of overt racism on a scale to which we are unaccustomed. Any protester with a racist poster can hijack a news cycle, while a racist image can live forever on the Internet. In fact, racially offensive images of the first couple are so prolific online that Google now runs an apologetic ad with the results of image searches of them. And its not all words and images; its actions as well. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigations 2008 hate crimes data released last week, anti-black hate crimes rose 4 percent from 2007, while the combined hate crimes against all other racial categories declined 11 percent. If you look at the two-year trend, which would include Obarnas ascension as a candidate, anti-black hate crimes have risen 8 percent, while those against the other racial groups have fallen 19 percent. This has had a sobering effect on blacks. According to a Nov. 9 report from Gallup, last summer 23 percent of blacks thought that race relations would get a lot better with the election of Obama. Now less than half that percentage says that things have actually gotten a lot better. The racial animosity that Obamas election has stirred up may have contributed to a rallying effect among blacks. According to a Gallup report published on Nov. 24, Obamas approval rating among whites has dropped to 39 percent, but among blacks it remains above 90 percent. Also, this hasnt exactly been a good year for black men in the news. Plaxico Burress was locked up for accidentally shooting off a gun in a club. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was locked up for intentionally shooting off his mouth at his own home. And Michael Jackson died after being shot full of propofol. Chris Brown brutally beat Rihanna. Former Representative William Jefferson was convicted. And most recently, the \personal failings\ of Tiger Woods portray him as an alley cat. Meanwhile, the most critically acclaimed black movie of the year, \Precious,\ features a black man who rapes and twice impregnates his own daughter. Rooting for the president feels like a nice counterbalance. However, the rallying creates a conundrum for blacks: how to air anxiety without further arming Obamas enemies. This dilemma has rendered blacks virtually voiceless on some pressing issues at a time when their voices would have presumably held greater sway. This means that Obama can get away with doing almost nothing to specifically address issues important to African-Americans and instead focus on the white voters hes losing in droves. This has not gone unnoticed. In the Nov. 9 Gallup poll, the number of blacks who felt that Obama would not go far enough in promoting efforts to aid the black community jumped 60 percent from last summer to now. The hard truth is that Obama needs white voters more than he needs black ones. According to my analysis, even if every black person in America had stayed home on Election Day, Obama would still be president. To a large degree, Obama was elected by white people, some of whom were more able to accept him because he consciously portrayed himself as racially ambiguous. In fact, commiserating with the blacks could prove politically problematic. In a study to be published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences this month, researchers asked subjects to rate images of the president to determine which ones best represented his \true essence.\ In some of the photos, his skin had been lightened. In others, it had been darkened. The result? The more people identified him with the \whiter\ images, the more likely they were to have voted for him, and vice versa. The Age of Obama, so far at least, seems less about Obama as a black community game-changer than as a White House gamesman. Its unclear if there will be a positive Obama Effect, but an Obama Backlash is increasingly apparent. Meanwhile, black people are also living a tale of two actions: grin and bear it.

C05762814	Secretary Clinton, Thank you! Will update you when I hear from her, and if there is anything else I should do, let me know. All best, Jackie ps Saw that Foreign Minister Yeo was on your schedule today. Fyi, he is one of my favorite Singaporeans because of this 2007 speech on China, which he posted to his blog (!): April 12, 2007 Foreign Minister George Yeos speech at a dinner organised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy on 5 February 2007, which he gave off-the-cuff. Thank you Kishore for your kind words. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. I was in India two weeks ago, had a good trip, spent nine days there. While in Calcutta after calling on the Chief Minister, I had a bit of time to look around so I attended a mass at Mother Theresas house. Very interesting gathering; there was a Singapore nun there, she had been there for over ten years; Sister Maria Tony. I wondered why someone from Singapore would want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of Calcutta and living that life. There were many nuns there who were in their ninth year. They take their first vow in the fifth year, renewable every year. In the tenth year they have to decide - final vows for eternity. So if you are not sure, please, theres a way out; if you are sure, then youre in the room. So the priest gave a very tough sermon and while he was talking, I could hear the din of traffic noise outside, in the streets of Calcutta. Then suddenly, I heard the call of the muezzin. Now this is a Hindu city. I told myself, I thought wow, what diversity in this country, India, and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from Albania should come into their midst, become one of them and then when she was beatified, was celebrated as an Indian, on the way to canonization. China and India in that comparison- China is not India. China has a very different sense of itself; its deep internal construction is very different. Superficially there are similarities, as there is between China and the US and China and Europe. But if you look into its deep construction, it is very different. When we talk about Chinas future and China in the 21st century, how China will behave in a world community, Chinas attitudes towards democracy, towards law, towards social justice. It is important first to look into this deep construction because that is their nature. Naturally we should not be deterministic, there is nothing inevitable in human history, but when we understand its nature, it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and youll be less suprised by its actions. A few years ago, the Chinese government embarked on a major project which is its dynastic duty- to write the history of the Qing dynasty, the Manchus, from 1368 to 1644. Ever since the Han dynasty, roughly contemporaneous with the Roman Empire, they developed a historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing the history of the previous period. So Sima Qian of the Later Han wrote of the earlier Han and the entire period before that; then later on they wrote about the Later Han, Jin wrote up the Three Kingdoms; Ming wrote up the Yuan: The Yuan, which was Mongol in its origins wrote up the Sung. Sung wrote up the Tang dynasty which was the Classical Period. The last dynasty, the Qing, collapsed in the Republican Revolution of 1911; this is now 2007. I think in 2003, they embarked on this project, The Official History of the Qing dynasty. When the former Vice Premier Li Lanqing was in Singapore recently, I asked him about it. He said \we told the scholars not to rush this project\. I asked him how long it would take to write this history. He said it would take many years, easily 10 years. I said, \have you collected the material?\ He said yes. I asked, \external sources?\ He said yes, external sources too. All the countries, the Vatican, European countries, the whole lot; all assembled - 24 official histories, this would be the 26th. And Lis instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw conclusions! Now Mao Tze Tung was a revolutionary, he was a great revolutionary. He overturned everything before but he knew his history, he read the 24 histories, and not only did he read them, he annotated them. But he wrote with a terrible, illegible scrawl, so scholars had to decipher those scrawls. Then they wrote commentaries on his commentaries and now its all published. It is very difficult for the Chinese to depart from their own history because its the same great plains, the same mountains more or less, the same neighbours more or less and they have seen the same patterns recur. So a long time ago during the Ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic period of the Three Kingdoms. The first line said: \Below heaven, great movements, great currents, long disunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity.\ So they accept as a part of their own deep nature that there are cycles in their civilisation; that they have ups and downs. In recent years, when you visit them, you could sense them feeling their own re-emergence, its a bit scary. In the initial years, they were lacking in confidence, they asked many questions, but now they know that there is an organic vitality. It is like an adolescent who watches his own development, and conscious of it. I say scary because for those of us who live on the periphery of that empire, what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually, to a greater or lesser degree envelope us. How do we see China? I think to begin with, its important not to try and, from an intellectual viewpoint, transpose our own experiences on to China, because I believe it will develop according to its own logic, according to its own DNA. It is growing now, it will continue to grow, it will develop its own contradictions and one day those contradictions, many years from now, will lead to its own decline. So they say at the beginning of a dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full, and at the end of a dynasty, the taxes are crushing but the treasury is empty. The important thing to realise about China is that some things are deeply resistant to change. Take Confucius. Every time they had to overturn a dynasty, they had to overturn Confucius, because Confucius justified the status quo. So throughout the 19th century, whether it was the Taiping Revolution, the Communist movement or Sun Yat Sen; they spent their lives debunking Confucius. It reached its final moment when they criticised Zhou Enlai together with Confucius- no- Lin Biao together with Confucius. That was the last paroxysm. Today, Hu Jingtao said [in Mandarin He Xie She Hui ], \harmonious society\. Suddenly you hear the resonance of Confucius coming back. And everywhere in the world on the pattern of Alliance Francaise, the Goethe Institute, the USIA, they establish Confucius Institutes and the learning of the Confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in China, not yet in the state curriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the Confucianist ditties. Now why is this important? From Mao to Deng to Jiang Zemin, at every stage, they re-interpreted Marx. They are comfortable with the young Marx, the idea of the superstructure on the economic base, the idea that politics is concentrated economics- that they like. But the class struggle, they downplay. They talk about the Three Represents, the progressive forces, the progressive elements, they nurture those. Now Hu Jingtao says \harmonious society\, \peaceful re-emergence\. This mindset has a certain attitude towards law, has a certain attitude towards religion, towards democracy and towards foreign policy and I would like, to deal with each in turn. Joseph Needham many years ago, I think in the 60s, the man who wrote The Science and Civilisation of China, that great encyclopedic work; he said its not that the Chinese have no legal tradition. In fact, by his estimation, the Chinese had a greater corpus of legal codification than the West. A greater corpus of legal codification than the West! Surprise, surprise. But the idea that the Emperor is below the law, that is completely alien to their thinking. Where did that idea come from? Well in the West, you may trace it back to Hammurabi, you may trace it back to Moses, to Greece, to Rome. But if you trace the evolution of that DNA, it goes back, way back, into its early beginnings. The Chinese had a very different evolutionary starting point. It was not in law, it was in an idea they call 1i which is proper conduct among human beings. They believe, deep in their instincts, that law is only a means towards justice, and that when the outcome of law is perverse, then that law must be overridden, because justice, proper conduct, the proper relationship among human beings must take precedence. And to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties, all that the earlier histories have summarised, are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in Western Europe, which had as its crowning moment the crowning of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800; to them, what are you talking about? For the Chinese, laws are more like regulations, means towards a larger end. Their attitude towards democracy follows a parallel pattern. Democracy is not an end in itself, democracy is a means and they are quite happy to consider democracy as a useful means towards government and that at appropriate places and appropriate levels, democracy is good. So at the village and the township level they have democracy, it is a universal franchise. They approve a slate of candidates, and they have fierce elections, fierce campaigning, and those who are incompetent or arrogant or despotic, they get chucked out. But once you reach the level of the cities and the provinces, they say no. No direct democracy. Why not? Because they do not believe, with their view of the universe, that that is the way to produce good government. Any more than the Catholic Church believes that the way to elect the Pope is through universal franchise. That the parishioners should decide who should be the parish priest. The Parish Council, maybe, thats ok. But the parish priest? Bishops? Universal franchise? Thats against Gods laws. They have that kind of instinct embedded in them, it is not Communist, it is just Chinese. And they know that too much democracy, invariably leads to localitis; of favouritism towards friends, relatives, people who are from the same villages whom we have a relationship with. We have the same problem in Singapore, in fact this problem exists throughout East Asia. Till today, apart from Singapore, among Chinese communities and among many East Asian communities, the idea that ultimate control of the business should go outside the family is unpersuasive. You talk to Li Ka-shing, you talk to Robert Kwok, you talk to Lim Soe Liong, you talk to any of them; they will go back to the family. Why? Because they believe that in the end, what matters at the deepest level, is trust. And the family guarantees you that trust. This is also the Indian wisdom. So you have the Marwaris controlling the economy of Calcutta, you have the Parsees, you have Sindhis, of which Kishore is a member, you have the Chettiars. They operate on the basis of deep trust and at a completely different level from that of contract law. And because they distrust local affiliations, in two dynasties, Ming and Qing, no senior official could serve within 400 miles of where he was born. No local official to serve within 400 miles, so in other words, in Singapore, no Singaporean can govern Singapore. They go beyond that, today theres almost no province in China where the provincial leader is from that province. Now you consider this, you transpose this onto Europe, its as if routinely, the President of France is not French. And if you are a German, you are disqualified as a Chancellor of the Republic. And an Italian cannot be trusted to serve in Rome. Ancient wisdom! What is remarkable is this is accepted as legitimate. If you are Cantonese and you have a Northener squatting over you, you do not consider it perverse or an abomination. This is part of life and in fact, you are more likely to have impartial governor than if a local boy were to be there, because he is more likely to favour those who are related to him or those who are his friends. So when you talk democracy to the Chinese, it is against this cultural backdrop. So what applied to the Qing dynasty, the Ming dynasty, they have taken a step further recently in China. They introduced even more rules, governing the circumstances under which you are disqualified from serving in the area near where you were born. You cant stay in a ministry for too long, you cant stay in a department for too long beacuse if you stay too long, you develop affiliations and those affiliations will result in sidedoors and guanxi and corruption. Of course, many of these rules will still be breached, and there will be scandals from time to time and they will act on those scandals. For as long as the central leadership is pristine, the system can be maintained. But one day they will become corrupt, as in so many previous dynasties, and a downward spiral begins. And it is very difficult in that situation to reverse it. So I mentioned at the table that for India, its not a country that can sustain a revolution, because its deep structure would not allow for it. I think China is a country which can only be renewed through periodic revolutions. Kishore asked me when- I said well maybe in 200 years time because these are long cycles and they expect as a matter of course that the history of the Peoples Republic would not be written by the Peoples Republic. It will be written by the next dynasty. Except that right now they say we shouldnt call it a dynasty, we are now democrats, we are a republic, there is no Emperor...Well, whatever term you call it, it will be done much later. Let me now talk about their attitude towards religion. Being a Roman Catholic I follow quite closely the ups and downs in their relationship with the Vatican and I find it quite fascinating. The Jesuits, when they went to China in the Ming dynasty, hoped that they could convert the Emperor, and all of China would become Catholic and a great mission would have been achieved. They never succeeded. Some of the brightest minds from Europe went there. Matteo Ricci, he corrected the Chinese calendar, he repaired the clocks in the palace, he saw the throne, but he never got to meet the Emperor and he died in China. And his tomb, its in the compound of the Beijing Party School today. And the church which he founded is still there today. Li Matou, thats what he called himself, he applied for permission to be buried in China and he was given that permission. Then when the Manchus swept southwards, in 1644, the missionaries thought now they had a chance, \the Manchus will be a bit more accomodating towards us, we will yet Christianise China\. So if you read the despatches of the missionaries during that period, the Tartar Wars they described it, they were full of hope. But not a chance. They appealed to the Second Emperor, Kangxi. \Can we send more missionaries?\ \No problem\. \Can we have them all report to a papal legate in Beijing\ \No such thing\. The Emperor imposed one condition: \you can send as many priests as you want to China but they must die in China, they cannot leave after that\. You see, instinctively, the Chinese, when they see the Catholic Church, they see someone like themselves, someone whose claim to its members is total. And for whom that loyalty is a jealous one. Mind you they do not try to control everything; they just control the big things, dogma, doctrine. After that you are left on your own and you are financially independent, but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and provincial secretaries, its the same as the Pope appointing Bishops and Bishops ordaining Priests and governing this vast empire, whether were talking about the Chinese empire or the Catholic empire. They have about the same number of members in the world which is why their interaction is a complex and difficult one. And over the appointment of Bishops, both seek ultimate authority. In the end they have got to find a way to resolve it. I can anticipate the Vaticans argument that \we are not of this realm, we are of the other realm, so please we are not in conflict\. As for the Chinese leaders, their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep religion at arms length. Those who govern the empire, they are areligious, they can have private religions, but in matters of their public conduct, they are Confucianist. In public, you are not a Catholic, you are not a Muslim, you are not a Buddhist. When the Jesuits went to China, they were very impressed by this - that it was possible to create a moral order based not on religion but on ethics. So impressed, that they wrote about it, and influenced people like Voltaire and the other Encyclopedists. It helped inspire the Frence revolution- that you could get rid of the Church, and still maintain a moral order in society. Ive talked about China and law, China and democracy, China and religion, now let me talk about China and foreign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest; about which I can only talk about generally because you are the experts in this field. I think its very difficult for the Chinese to break from their old mindset that they are [Zhong Guo], the Middle Kingdom, they are at the center of the Universe, then there are the other chopsticks peoples who are semi-Sinic. I think they consider Singapore to be semi-Sinic. Then there are those who are beyond that realm, who are what the Greeks would have called Barbarians. The Mongols, the Manchus, the Europeans, the Americans, the Indians and so on. Now all that jargon of course is not in use today. They are very civilised, they will welcome you with great hospitality - lavish dinners, very courteous words, offering you the best of everything in the house. It reminded me of the way my mother used to teach us at home, we were a big family and the stranger has got to be treated well, the visitor has to be treated well, because you are afraid of the visitor. So you always treat visitors better than your own family members because the visitor is capricious, he can harm you so make sure you fit him in. Those who are within your authority, you can always maintain order anyway. This is the way, in their minds, the universe is ordered. So I can understand why the Koreans, the Japanese, the Vietnamese, to some extent, the Singaporeans, they feel uncomfortable about what they see as a repetition of a pattern they have seen many times before in the past. Will the Chinese change this principle of foreign policy, I think they have, because, never in their history have they met, have they existed in close contact with competing centers of power, with the US, with Europe, India, and you are no longer separated by oceans which cannot be crossed, mountains which cannot be crossed, now they are connected. So they are making adjustments. It will be interesting to watch how they handle their Olympics; if the Olympics become an exercise of pure Chinese nationalism, I think the international reaction against China will be very severe. But I think the Chinese will be sophisticated. I expect they will organise cheer teams for the Americans, for the Japanese, so that there is an appearance of courtesy and common humanity. They are very careful to ensure that their words fit conditions today. But let me say in their defence that many of these methods they use arise out of fear, not out of a desire to dominate. If you analyse the old tributary system, those who sent tributes got more than they gave in return. It became a racket. So the Japanese merchants competed to get tokens from [Ryukyu] in order to be able to do the China trade because it meant a lot of money. The Chinese are fearful of foreigners. They are fearful of the Russians to the north, the Muslims to the West, the Indians across the Himalayas, but mostly the Americans across the Pacific. Their strategy is to keep the temperature low, low profile, hide the shine of your armour, the shine of your sword, just play the game and concentrate on economic development. Internally will they make preparations? I have no doubt, because they have a deep fear. Is their intention to dominate, to conquer, the way the European powers did in the past? I dont think so. I dont think there is a great desire to turn non-Chinese into Chinese. Maybe Korea, maybe Vietnam, maybe Mongolia, who at various points in time were part of their greater empire, they might consider worth civilising. But beyond that, Sinicising Indians, Russians? No, I dont think they will want to do that. So as they now become stronger and more powerful, I believe that while their old nature will re-assert itself, they will also be reacting to us. If they find the world a threatening place, they will develop their own responses to those threats. Quite early in the day, they wanted to neutralise Southeast Asia, Asean. It had never been an area which threatened them, historically. So they didnt worry about Southeast Asia as a threat. But resources, sea lanes, they go through Southeast Asia. And they made a dramatic move a few years ago. Zhu Rongji was here for the ASEAN-China summit. He said, \free trade agreement\. At that time when he announced it, the leaders of ASEAN almost fell off their chairs. We thought of China an economic threat to us. Not as a partner. Took us almost a year to digest the implications and to say yes, lets negotiate. Step by step. And all the time China was assuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit. When the Framework Agreement was signed by Zhu Rongji in 2002 in Phonm Penh, he made two remarkable statements. He said if after 10 years, the agreement benefits China more than it benefits Southeast Asia, let us renegotiate it. I can never imagine the American USTR, or the European Trade Commissioner, talking like that. I mean in a contract, a deal is a deal, its settled for eternity. Then he said: \China does not seek for itself an exclusive position in Southeast Asia\, so he acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl, we intended to be promiscuous from the beginning. Towards Northeast Asia, I think it is very complicated, because there is so much history and legacy. Towards Central Asia, towards Russia, they have deep fears. Towards America, it has become a relationship bound together at so many points, a rupture would become more and more unthinkable. But it is going to be a very difficult relationship, it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this century. If its badly managed there will be war, if its properly managed there will be another generation of peace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty. In this area, you are the experts, but whenever I see China and watch its moves, I go back to its deep nature because its not easy for a country so vast, with such a sense of itself, to depart too much from its deep nature.

C05767761	http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_MA_45398436.pdf FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 9, 2010 INTERVIEWS: DEAN DEBNAM 888-621-6988 / 919-880-4888 (serious media inquiries only please, other questions can be directed to Tom Jensen) QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POLL: TOM JENSEN 919-744-6312 Senate Race Competitive Raleigh, N.C. — The race to replace Ted Kennedy in the US Senate is looking like a toss up, with Republican Scott Brown up 48-47 on Martha Coakley. Brown is benefiting from depressed Democratic interest in the election and a huge lead among independents for his surprisingly strong standing. Those planning to vote in the special election only report having voted for Barack Obama in 2008 by a 16 point margin, in contrast to his actual 26 point victory in the state. That decline in turnout from Obama voters plagued Democratic candidates for Governor in Virginia and New Jersey last fall. Beyond that 66% of Republicans say theyre very excited about turning out while only 48% of Democrats express that sentiment. Brown leads 63-31 with independents and is winning 17% of the Democratic vote while Coakley receives only 6% support from GOP voters. Both candidates are relatively popular, with 57% viewing Brown favorably to only 25% unfavorable and 50% with a positive opinion of Coakley to 42% negative. Those folks planning to vote in the special election are actually opposed to Obamas health care plan by a 47/41 margin and only narrowly express approval of the Presidents overall job performance 44/43. \The Massachusetts Senate race is shaping up as a potential disaster for Democrats,\ said Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling. \Martha Coakley's complacent campaign has put Scott Brown in a surprisingly strong position and she will need to step it up in the final week to win a victory once thought inevitable.\ PPP surveyed 744 likely Massachusetts voters from January 7th to 9th. The margin of error is +/-3.6%. Other factors, such as refusal to be interviewed and weighting, may introduce additional error that is more difficult to quantify. Complete results are attached and can be found at www.publicpolicypolling.com.

However, like SB1070, officials in the course of official \contact\ (i.e. Traffic stops, investigations, hot pursuit) are authorized to request proof of migratory status. They do this in practice routinely. Frequently, individuals who cannot prove legal status are referred to INM (federal CBP-equivalent). In practice, GoM authorities at all levels engage in exploitative treatment of migrants, primarily Central Americans heading to the US. These abuses have been well documented by international human rights groups, as well as by multiple documentary and news media reports.

Sid http://blog.newsweelocom/blogs/thegaggle/archive/2010/01/22/should-foreign-corporations-spend-money-on-u-s-political- candidates.aspx Posted Friday, January 22, 2010 1:05 PM Newsweek Should Foreign Corporations Spend Money on U.S. Political Candidates? Krista Gesaman Foreign businesses might be the real winners in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission, the landmark case that allows corporations and unions to spend limitless amounts of money on presidential and congressional political campaigns. A majority of large businesses are now owned by foreign entities, and this means international corporations could pour tons of money into the United States political scene, potentially swaying the political climate. The biggest questions with this ruling is the scope of the term \corporation,\ says Edward Foley, law professor at the Ohio State University College of Law and director of the election-law program. Does the high court want this decision to apply to foreign corporations as well as domestic ones, he ponders? The truth is, the court didnt make a decision one way or the other. Foley best explains the potential issues by talking about the electronic, video, and communication giant, Sony. The corporation is headquartered in Japan, but a large number of its shareholders reside in the United States. In fact, people can even buy and trade Sonys stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The issue is whether this corporation, with strong ties to a foreign country and the United States, should be permitted to independently contribute money to presidential and congressional campaigns. The court sought to expand First Amendment protection for corporations, but did it really mean to promote the free flow of ideas from Russian or Chinese corporations, Foley asks? Justice John Pau! Stevens focused on the same concerns in his dissenting opinion. The majoritys position \would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans,\ he writes. This afternoon, President Obama asked Congress to \develop a forceful response\ to the ruling. But with Congress juggling so many other important issues, its unlikely that a change will be made in the immediate future. This could mean that foreign cash could be supporting political candidates in next years congressional midterm elections.

He is author of Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). His website is here Subjects: • Democracy and government • International politics • United States • democracy & power • american power & the world • rise of the new right The rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama 5 presidency is shaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But where has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal begin_of the_skype highlighting end of the_skype highlighting, author of \Republican Gomorrah\, enters the heady world of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence that fuel its sub-cultures insurgent activism. \He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since the Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes? In reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility\ - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti- Semite and Jew I am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack Obama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada. Perusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard urgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. \These people that are purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country\, a gun dealer told me outside a show in Reno. \Good luck Obama\, a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. \We outnumber him 100 to 1.\ At this time, the Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national medias radar. In September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan Walton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay former Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen college Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a \left-wing hack\ while a hysterical young man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a \racist\. Afterward, university police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he shouted threats. Who was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative of a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of Republican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in homosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a curable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of run-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order. My encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be symptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The rights days of rage were only beginning. The constellation Through his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against partisanship, declaring that there were \no red states\ and no \conservative America\. Apparently, he thought it was merely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and womens rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to think that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was not deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain \divisive\ personalities, easily wiped away with gestures toward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but separated by \partisans\. The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together. Many of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his innocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could \bridge the partisan divide\. Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected conservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies \fifth columnists\ but now fervently supported Obama, wrote that the new president was destined to become \a liberal Reagan who can reunite America\. This optimism pervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes. After all, why couldnt we all just get along? In his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: \I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.\ Once he was elected, conservatives concluded that they could reverse Obamas strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most fearsome images they could conjure (see \Barack Obama, the fallen messiah\, 23 December 2009). Obamas multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected Obamas legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the \Birther\ movement that sought to challenge his citizenship. The movements most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a dentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling in the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that Obama planned to create a \civilian national security force\, Taitz told me she \realised that Obama was another Stalin - it's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.\ After becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obamas family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii, Taitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with Californias secretary of state Debra Bowen demanding an investigation into Obamas eligibility to serve as president. Taitzs plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an Orange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly prayed for Obamas death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges, Taitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers from Sean Hannity to CNNs Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her \greatest supporter\, was eventually fired as an indirect result of his hosting of her). In March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential candidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice in government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican respondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasnt born in the United States, while 30% \werent sure\. \Obama should be in the Big House\, Taitz shrieked to me, \not the White House!\ When Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement activated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the \Other\, making him seem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a healthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of bipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's MaraVSade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far- right activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on Washington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's top-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the \9-12 Project\ to restore the sense of unity (and siege mentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy. While covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida; demonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden; others carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. \We can fight al-Qaida, we cant kill Obama\, said an aging demonstrator. Another told me, \Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world\, pointing to placards he had fashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to another activist, Obamas agenda was similar to Hitlers: \Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had his own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.\ The seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies against Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as the French collaborator Marshall Petain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot assassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence. Members of the Tea Party \Patriots\ did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to Hitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government of the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped Obama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no interest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea Partys primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president and his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always transparent. The Tea Partys strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats but also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Paters were convinced this would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the \real America\. At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting that 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying \ABCNews.com reported an approximate figure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters.\ Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of \Freedom works! Freedom works!\ Unknown to most of the Tea Paters, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy- group, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibsons version of William Wallace in Bra veheart. Indeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea Party movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties. The movements leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea Party \Patriots\ from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armeys lobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armeys other \real American\ clients included the Marxist terror-cult, the Peoples Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from Saddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected a consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks paid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants. The rumour If Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after Obamas inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palins motives for quitting became clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular contributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, \Sarah Palins Alaska\. Palin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential campaign and a travelling carnival. Whether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the Republican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos desperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's campaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be \catastrophic\ for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one of the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for Schmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its most fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff. A special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test of Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown far-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate Republican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an improbable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies claimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She went on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's GOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's regular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state. The self-described \hardcore pro-lifer\ Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay marriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself accordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of \economic freedom\. She claimed the Democratic \cap- and-trade\ plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare reform as a Trojan horse for \socialism\ (though she admitted her family \used to hustle over the border\ to take advantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted out on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for \death panels\ that would recommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin transformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous. The source of Palin's \death panels\ smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed in an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into the government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine Award, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a rumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as \the lie of 2009\. McCaughey's latest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the mainstream. In June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's chief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's T-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. \President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus reviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there\, LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin charged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a Hitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a LaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: \Why do you continue to support a Nazi policy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?\ Two months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker Newt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of indignant Tea Paters. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death panels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of \the devaluing of human life, putting a price on each individual.\ He thundered, \The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!\ The death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican Party. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the federal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government- sponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005, when the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the government to interfere in a private family matter of life and death. The enemy The slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray. The new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep America Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement that was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: \One of the reasons you see people so concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so reluctant to defend the nation overseas.\ With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same table, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again. The experiments in \terror-management theory\ developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of Skidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have demonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain the effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American and somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical reasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters responded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing army ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance. Obama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed by far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat team of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer \grew angry recently over fears Obama would outlaw guns.\ Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website portraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough investigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party rallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by the anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight episodes of Bill O'Reilly's \OReilly Factor,\ OReilly had referred to Tiller as \Tiller the baby killer\, a criminal guilty of \Nazi stuff.\ \I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day\, OReilly proclaimed. In August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and gunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodinis motives away by homing in on passages in his online diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic masturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual frustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation. The day after Obamas election victory, Sodini wrote: \Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media LOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obamas plans for the economy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl ... Kinda a reverse indentured servitude thing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. Not my little girl, daddy says! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].\ In another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini revealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, \Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,\ from a National Review ad. A year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: \I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring the country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I dont think any group of political leaders will achieve this for us.\ Whether or not Sodinis murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically death-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: \Death lives!\ The bible More than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and conspiracy that consumed the Tea Party \Patriots\. During a broadcast of \Fox and Friends\, Beck opined that Obama \has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white culture.\ As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community organiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Becks crusade. From there, Beck targeted another black Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of Obamas \socialist\ agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to \Obama money\ as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City- based youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to Beck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that \Obama's SS\ was being trained across inner-city America. In September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the rights new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to use the poor peoples advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. \Trust me\, Beck said, \Everybody now says theyre going to be talking about healthcare. I dont think so.\ (His statement was reminiscent of Rush Limbaughs scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: \Whitewater is about healthcare.\) Beck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James OKeefe and Hannah Giles inside Acorn field offices. In the videos, OKeefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she was a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. OKeefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp costume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later admitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of all criminal wrongdoing. In a separate incident OKeefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals disguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, OKeefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded conservative outfits; OKeefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured leading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon. While OKeefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned the highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like OReilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Becks opinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. \Glenn Beck has taught us everything we know\, a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. \Hes opened our eyes to so much.\ But unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994, Beck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves, Beck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in hopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine and alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. \We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the drugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was\, a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who called himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show. Like Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self- destructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away in a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from freedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into conservative radio diatribes. ,When Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political worldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and often snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent, Matthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting the work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar. Suddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures. Thanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as \required reading\ on the website of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the Hidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon and a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to selling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is little more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified, to explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation is un-American, that \coercive taxation\ is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin Franklin, who wrote at length on the merits of \amours\ with \old women,\ and who famously solicited prostitutes and fathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage. Though Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with fringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that \powerful influences congregating in the United States\ like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United States into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he founded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies. Skousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He boasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist plots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours of Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.) Skousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor, \conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.\ From there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and earning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of \promoting [his] own anti- communism for obvious financial purposes.\ Skousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight Eisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the radar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling everyone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints distanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared entirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik observed in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea Party \suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.\ The descent Besides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots celebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama. On a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his mentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his spellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. \If you control the food supply\, Mack warned, \you control the people. And thats the first step to slavery.\ Already a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack reemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government. Along with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea Party militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to refuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps. Because the groups members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance. Besides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established figure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and Tactics fora Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on \war criminals, secret policemen, rats.\ With Obama in office, Vandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by cashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month. For all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obamas agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the greatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since 1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform was introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the de facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure that the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women. But after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He introduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance plans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in healthcare negotiations. \Hes a big hero now in the pro-life community\, Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to George W Bush - told me in November 2009. \Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats having any power.\ To the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to Hudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision forbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi, Obama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he and his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports seeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out virulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of diatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: \Bart the Baby-Killer.\ On 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of Obama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the civil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the crowd on their way inside the Capitol. \Nigger!\ a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a \faggot\, eliciting laughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face. With the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of \Kill the bill!\ drifted into calls for violence. \I would gladly stand with any of you men here and take these fascists down\, a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of an amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. \You havent heard the last of me!\ The next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Paters. The demonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House floor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over. Republican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupaks original amendment, demanded a motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In response, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. \The motion to commit does not support life\, Stupak declared. \It is the Democrats who have stood up....\ Heckling from the Republican side interrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing Republican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, \Baby killer!\ Other Republicans joined in, parroting base insults. While the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a right-wing Kristallnacht. \If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows\, Vanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. \Break them NOW. Break them and run to break again.\ Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and Arizona had been shattered. Meanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed to the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative Anthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder. The brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged after a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressmans) and encouraged activists to \drop by\ to express their anger about Perriellos recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the window of Representative Louise Slaughters office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper attacks. After the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy. Crusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows of elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence thickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: \Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!\ Thus concluded the first phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.
C05769281	Steve Mull is proposing that you do a conference call with the E3 FMs and Ashton sometime this week. Here is the rationale and background: The European Union Foreign Affairs Council, comprised of all 27 EU Foreign Ministers, will next meet on May 10. In a conversation April 26, Bill Burns persuaded the E3 and European Commission to support adding to the agenda of that meeting a discussion of preparations for the sanctions the EU will impose following passage of a UNSCR. The European Council, comprised of the EUs heads of government, will meet on June 16-17 — a meeting which could direct the imposition of such sanctions if we succeed in passing an UNSCR by then. The purpose of your teleconference would be to hear from the E3 and Ashton a status report on the EUs preparations to impose such sanctions, and to discuss how the U.S. could best support the EUs forward progress. It would supplement experts level consultations we have been conducting for several weeks, including meetings on May 3 and May 6. The measures the Europeans are considering include bans on new Iranian bank branches in the EU, correspondent banking relationships, new investment in the Iranian energy sector, and on access for Iranian ships to European ports.

Believes there is a strong basis for doing so. Believes it can be done by combining a renewed political negotiation with change on the ground, bottom up, as set out in Prime Minister Fayyads plan for a Palestinian state. To this end,,Tony Blair, as Quartet Representative, will work in partnership with Senator Mitchell to support the political negotiation by mobilizing the efforts of the international community: (1) to build support for the institutional capacity and future governance of a future Palestinian state; (2) to improve freedom of movement and access for Palestinians; (3) to encourage further private sector investment; and (4) to bring change in the living conditions of the people in Gaza.

C05778390	According to the Reid staff, they will tentatively start the Treaty on Wednesday and stay on it through COB Thursday. Then File cloture on the CR. It takes consent to stay on START while we wait for the CR cloture petition to ripen, which would be Saturday w/o consent. So at least two days on the Treaty, at a minimum, and possibly more. But, the good news, is that it appears that we are starting the Treaty, and will go back to it after the FY11 funding issues are resolved. We will re-double our efforts to support the SRAP team and do whatever you need in the coming days on Af/Pak and beyond.

C05770397	Here is what PJ said on the subject: The Secretary this morning spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu regarding Iran. During the call, the Secretary stressed that, in our view, Irans recent diplomacy was an attempt to stop Security Council action without actually taking steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program. Theres nothing new and nothing encouraging in Irans recent statements. It has failed to demonstrate good faith and build confidence with the international community, which was the original intent of the Tehran research reactor proposal. It has yet to formally respond to the IAEA. She stressed that the burden is with Iran and its lack of seriousness about engagement requires us to intensify efforts to apply greater pressure on Iran. That was the primary purpose of the conversation. They briefly touched on other subjects, including Middle East peace and the relationship between Turkey and Azerbaijan.

They are now reaching out to get permission for you to tell their stories tomorrow night; assuming they will grant it, I am writing up their stories now and will fax a revised draft to you shortly.

C05771773	been released
C05776474	Here is the Republican former Secretaries of State op ed, which ran in todays wash post. The Republican case for ratifying New START bn)://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/01/AR2010120104598.html?hpid=topnews By Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Colin L. Powell Thursday, December 2, 2010; Republican presidents have long led the crucial fight to protect the United States against nuclear dangers. That is why Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush negotiated the SALT I, START I and START II agreements. It is why President George W. Bush negotiated the Moscow Treaty. All four recognized that reducing the number of nuclear arms in an open, verifiable manner would reduce the risk of nuclear catastrophe and increase the stability of Americas relationship with the Soviet Union and, later, the Russian Federation. The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons. As a result, we urge the Senate to ratify the New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It is a modest and appropriate continuation of the START I treaty that expired almost a year ago. It reduces the number of nuclear weapons that each side deploys while enabling the United States to maintain a strong nuclear deterrent and preserving the flexibility to deploy those forces as we see fit. Along with our obligation to protect the homeland, the United States has responsibilities to allies around the world. The commander of our nuclear forces has testified that the 1,550 warheads allowed under this treaty are sufficient for all our missions - and seven former nuclear commanders agree. The defense secretary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the head of the Missile Defense Agency - all originally appointed by a Republican president - argue that New START is essential for our national defense. We do not make a recommendation about the exact timing of a Senate ratification vote. That is a matter for the administration and Senate leaders. The most important thing is to have bipartisan support for the treaty, as previous nuclear arms treaties did. Although each of us had initial questions about New START, administration officials have provided reasonable answers. We believe there are compelling reasons Republicans should support ratification. First, the agreement emphasizes verification, providing a valuable window into Russias nuclear arsenal. Since the original START expired last December, Russia has not been required to provide notifications about changes in its strategic nuclear arsenal, and the United States has been unable to conduct on-site inspections. Each day, Americas understanding of Russias arsenal has been degraded, and resources have been diverted from national security tasks to try to fill the gaps. Our military planners increasingly lack the best possible insight into Russias activity with its strategic nuclear arsenal, making it more difficult to carry out their nuclear deterrent mission. Second, New START preserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses. The testimonies of our military commanders and civilian leaders make clear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans. Although the treaty prohibits the conversion of existing launchers for intercontinental and submarine-based ballistic missiles, our military leaders say they do not want to do that because it is more expensive and less effective than building new ones for defense purposes. Finally, the Obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal. Funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process. The administration has put forth a 10-year plan to spend $84 billion on the Energy Departments nuclear weapons complex. Much of the credit for getting the administration to add $14 billion to the originally proposed $70 billion for modernization goes to Sen. Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who has been vigilant in this effort. Implementing this modernization program in a timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond. Although the United States needs a strong and reliable nuclear force, the chief nuclear danger today comes not from Russia but from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists. Given those pressing dangers, some question why an arms control treaty with Russia matters. It matters because it is in both parties interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship. It also matters because Russias cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the Iranian and North Korean programs. Russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure \loose nukes\ in Russia and elsewhere. And Russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in Afghanistan, a breeding ground for international terrorism. Obviously, the United States does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends. Any treaty must be considered on its merits. But we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest, and we should consider the ramifications of not ratifying it. Whenever New START is brought up for debate, we encourage all senators to focus on national security. There are plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the American economy. With our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and a growing federal debt bomb, we anticipate significant conflict between Democrats and Republicans. It is, however, in the national interest to ratify New START. The writers were secretaries of state for the past five Republican presidents.

C05772543	To follow up - the team tried its hand at a boiled down version of the CFR speech, but in 700 words it lost the nuance and amounted to a series of generalisms. We felt that a more specific topic would allow for a sharper message. We selected democracy because it allows you to talk about a broad and relevant trend that cuts across global affairs; to reprise signature themes like Internet freedom, civil society, and the democracy/development nexus; and to underscore that this administration takes these issues seriously. This was also an element of your CFR speech and provides some continuity in that respect as well. We were not looking to break new ground but rather to reinforce.

C05771047	PIR <preines Monday, August 16, 2010 11:48 PM Huma Abedin; CDM; Jake Sullivan \minister in a skirt\ http://mobile.nytimes.com/a rticle?a=644869 North Korea Takes to Twitter and YouTube By CHOE SANG-HUN The New York Times August 17, 2010 SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea has taken its propaganda war against South Korea and the United States to a new frontier: YouTube and Twitter. In the last month, North Korea has posted a series of video clips on YouTube brimming with satire and vitriol against leaders in South Korea and the United States. In one clip, it called Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton a \minister in a skirt\ and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates a \war maniac,\ while depicting the South Korean defense minister, Kim Tae-young, as a \servile dog\ that likes to be patted by \its American master.\ Such language used to be standard in North Korea's cold-war-era propaganda. Its revival is testimony to the increased chill in relations between the Koreas in recent months. In the past week, North Korea also began operating a Twitter account under the name uriminzok, or \our nation.\ Both the Twitter and YouTube accounts are owned by a user named \uriminzokkiri.\ The Web site www.uriminzokkiri.com is run by the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, a propaganda agency in Pyongyang. Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for the Unification Ministry in Seoul, said, \It is clear that these accounts carry the same propaganda as the Norths official news media, but we have not been able to find out who operates them.\ The two Koreas agreed to stop their psychological war after their first summit meeting in 2000. But South Korea resumed propaganda radio broadcasts in May, when it accused the North of torpedoing one of its warships, killing 46 sailors. North Korea, which denies involvement, has vowed to retaliate. It appears to have found a way with Twitter and YouTube, with their intended audience clearly South Koreans. (North Korea keeps its people isolated from the outside world.) \YouTube and Twitter gave North Korea a high-tech detour for its propaganda,\ said Paik Hak-soon, an analyst at Sjong Institute. \But fundamentally, its not new technology but rather political tension that drives the North to lash out desperately in the face of mounting international pressure.\ During the cold war era, South Korea punished people caught listening to North Korean broadcasts. Several years ago, during the brief era of its \sunshine policy\ of engaging the North, the South allowed its people access to North Korean Web sites. But today, when a computer user in South Korea clicks on an item on the North Korean Twitter account, a government warning against \illegal content\ pops up. These blocks have triggered criticism here that the Seoul government does not trust its people to form their own opinions about the totalitarian North. But the government says the North is using the Internet to spread conspiracy theories about who was behind the sinking of the South Korean warship, including one claim that an American submarine did so to foster a militant mood in the South. The Twitter account, which provides links to the North Korean Web site, had 928 followers as of Monday. But a few YouTube video clips uploaded by the North commanded thousands of views. In one such clip, North Korea attacked Yu Myung-hwan, the South Korean foreign minister, who recently criticized \pro- North Korean youths\ who voted for the opposition in the June local elections, saying, \If they like the North so much, they should go and live under Kim Jong-il.\ The clip's narrator calls Mr. Yu a \pro-American flunky\ and advised Mr. Yu to earn a living \mopping the floor of the Pentagon.\ Another clip claimed that North Korea would prevail in a war with the \American imperialists\ because it was armed with nuclear-fusion technology; because of its juche, or ideology of \self-reliance\; and because of a philosophical treatise written by Kim II-sung, the North's founding president and the father of Kim Jong-il, who died in 1994. \I dont think this propaganda from the North will have any significant impact among South Koreans,\ said Yoo Ho-yeol, an expert on North Korea at Korea University here. \People watch this for fun, not to be influenced.\

C05771218	Hurricane Tomas in route to Haiti to hit 4 Nov right now on southern claw. SouthComs announcement: USS IWO JIMA DEPLOYS TO HAITI AS TROPICAL STORM APPROACHES MIAMI - U.S. Southern Command directed the amphibious ship USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7) to steam toward Haiti today in preparation for the forecasted arrival of tropical storm Tomas later this week. Iwo Jima will deploy to Haiti from Suriname, where it arrived Thursday on its final country visit for Continuing Promise 2010, a four-month, humanitarian civic assistance deployment to eight nations in the Caribbean region. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Haiti later this week. Large amphibious ships, like Iwo Jima, resemble small aircraft carriers and include the ability to support helicopter and landing craft operations to quickly move personnel and cargo, making it an ideal platform to support humanitarian-relief missions on short notice. A crew of 1,600 military and civilian medical, engineering, aviation, logistical and other support personnel are embarked aboard Iwo Jima, including U.S. Navy engineers, a contingent of 500 Marines with logistical-support expertise, volunteers from the U.S. Public Health Service and various non-governmental organizations (NG0s), as well as medical, dental and engineering professionals from Europe, North America and South America. Eight CH-46 Sea Knight, medium-lift, dual-rotor helicopters; two MH-60 Knight Hawk helicopters and two amphibious landing craft units (ICUs) are on Iwo Jima to support the ships operations. Iwo Jima is a Wasp-class amphibious ship capable of speeds in excess of 20 knots that can provide robust ship-to-shore, as well as shore-to-shore logistics support during contingencies ranging from traditional military operations to humanitarian and disaster-relief missions. Because of the Caribbean regions history of severe-weather events during the peak months of the hurricane season, the ship has remained in the area throughout its present deployment, ready to support U.S. disaster relief efforts when directed. Iwo Jima was in Port-de-Paix, Haiti, from July 24 through Aug. 3. It was the first stop on CP10 and the crew provided medical assistance to more than 4,000 Haitian citizens, performed 32 surgeries, completed six engineering projects, and delivered 231 pallets of humanitarian-assistance supplies donated by NG0s. In September 2008, the amphibious ship USS Kearsarge deployed to Haiti to support U.S. relief efforts after a succession of storms (Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike) devastated the country. Kearsarge provided robust air and sealift support, delivering 3.3 million pounds of food, water and other aid to communities impacted by the disasters.

But State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell, surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery. Every decision, large and small, is shaped and made by the president himself and enforced by Denis McDonough, a deputy NSC adviser and the administration's Lord High Executioner. Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside counselors or outside advisers. Amateur Hour at the White House by Leslie H. Gelb November 22, 2009 I 10:50pm The Asia trip was not worth Obama's time. Leslie H. Gelb on why the president should shake up his foreign policy team—and make sure the deals are done before he leaves home. President Obama's nine-day trip to Asia is worth a look back to fix two potent problems, past and future. First, the trip's limited value per day of presidential effort suggests a disturbing amateurishness in managing America's power. On top of the inexcusably clumsy review of Afghan policy and the fumbling of Mideast negotiations, the message for Mr. Obama should be clear: He should stare hard at the skills of his foreign-policy team and, more so, at his own dominant role in decision-making. Something is awry somewhere, and he's got to fix it. Secondly, the Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. He only scratched the surface in his calls for multilateralism and mutual understanding. He needs to paint pictures of how Washington will help solve regional security and trade problems. Otherwise, most Asian nations will continue their unwanted drift toward China and away from the United States. A meditation on his journey should start by forgetting half of the last week's commentary. Unbelievably, some criticized Obama for not getting China to \throw its weight around.\ What Asian leaders want that? None that I know of. Others lamented that Obama couldn't make \demands\ on China anymore. The presumption here is that China is now king, and that Washington can no longer have its way with Beijing. The facts are that Washington never did boss Beijing around, and that China is not now ruling the roost (more accurately, it's sitting on its own eggs). Others contended that Obama continued his pattern of trashing America's friends and coddling its authoritarian enemies like China. It's hard to stomach this nonsense from the same conservative crowd that forever praised George W. Bush for accommodating China and alienating America's allies. Some analysts played fair and acknowledged that administration officials tried to tell reporters not to expect \deliverables\ on the trip, and to see the journey more as a recognition of Asia's new importance and America's desire for a new co- operative spirit. That's a commendable thought, but hardly justification for almost two weeks of the president's time (when you consider preparations)— especially when he's got a tanking economy, health-care reform woes, and decisions to make on Afghanistan. Presidents take trips like this one only when they need breakthroughs and accomplishments on certain issues that can't be agreed on without the pressure of an impending presidential visit. In fact, most presidents wouldn't even commit to trips abroad without knowing that key deals would be finally agreed on and announced during the visit itself. The prospective visit is the power jackhammer to nail down the deals. Just take a gander at trips planned for Richard Nixon by Henry Kissinger or for George H. W. Bush by James Baker. Obama's travels were a chance to settle or make concrete progress on thorny issues like greenhouse-gas emissions, and the fate of U.S. bases on Okinawa, which the new Japanese government insists on moving. It was time to announce ways to gain fixes on the U.S.-South Korean trade treaty, long stalled in Congress. It was a moment to show that Beijing would actually make some mutually beneficial compromises on exchange rates or economic sanctions against Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs. Absent guarantees of progress on issues such as these, Mr. Obama should have taken a well- deserved vacation in Hawaii. Matters were made worse on the scene. It was not good optics for Obama to bow to Japan's emperor. He seems to do this stuff spontaneously and inexplicably, as with his bow to the Saudi King some months ago. And it was truly unfortunate that Obama and his aides didn't flatly insist that he be allowed to address the Chinese people directly on television and meet with non-stacked Chinese groups—as has been the case during previous presidential visits. Beijing's leaders obviously didn't feel confident enough of their own standing at home to give the popular Mr. Obama such access. But he and his team should have made it a precondition of the visit. Its absence left an unhappy taste. The Asia trip presented an important opportunity to carve out a new American leadership role in the world's most dynamic economic region, and Mr. Obama missed it. The White House might try to blame the State Department (such an easy and delicious target) for the missteps. But State's role in the conceptual planning of the trip was not central, and the department's senior Asia hand, Kurt Campbell, surely knew better. It's also hard to tar the National Security Council's own senior Asia expert, Jeff Bader, another pro like Campbell. Perhaps even higher officials at the NSC dropped the ball. Perhaps Mr. Obama might take responsibility himself, as President Kennedy did after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. Now, that would truly clear the air—and open the door to some obvious and necessary changes in the administration's decision-making machinery.

Does Obama get enough pushback? Is he hearing a range of views? Can he see that his powerful intellect might profit from bowing to the voices of experience? If Mr. Obama reflects on the Asia journey and other mishaps, he might loosen the reins and bring in additional policy and diplomatic pros as inside counselors or outside advisers. If most Asia hands inside and outside the government had designed the Obama trip, here's what they would have advised: Go beyond the usual and trite message of building mutual understanding and cooperation, and stop invoking the God of Multilateralism without spelling out America's leadership role. Asia is now overflowing with multilateral organizations. Washington is a member of a few key ones, like Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asian Development Bank. But that has little to do with other new and key groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Russia, China, Uzbekistan, etc.) and ASEAN, the association of Southeast Asian nations. Asian nations are increasingly organizing themselves into these groups, and Washington hasn't really figured out its role. Most Asian nations want that role to be a prominent one—in fact, the leadership position. They're afraid of China, afraid that China won't be as attentive to their concerns in the future as America was in the past. At the same time, they don't want Washington to come into these groupings and cause problems with Beijing. They want Washington to figure out a leadership position constructed on the proven American ability to help solve common problems in the common interest. They want an America they remember, one that can get things done and doesn't let problems fester. That U.S. policy was the main missing ingredient on Obama's trip. Washington played architect and solidified its leadership in Europe after World War II with NATO, the Marshall Plan, and various trade and economic organizations like the World Bank. Asian nations are yearning for the same kind of creativity today from a brilliant American president in the new Pacific Era. Leslie H. Gelb, a former New York Times columnist and senior government official, is author of Power Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy (HarperCollins 2009), a book that shows how to think about and use power in the 21st century.

Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below. As the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options. This is long but worth it. May 6, 2010, 6:11 amIt's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens.Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of \13 Bankers.\The Greek \rescue\ package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone.The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by the International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new program calls for \fiscal adjustments\ — cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts — totaling 11 percent of gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity.This new program is honest enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed.Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels, has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by 2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. — the initial shock to demand could be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession — and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond.Such figures seem extremely optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward Greece in some northern European policy circles.The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end of 2011.Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy — e.g., with G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5 percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to- G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an \upside scenario.\The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad, roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign debt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their \new normal.\ Last week the European leadership panicked — very late in the day — when it realized that the euro zone itself was at risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors will run from Portugal and Spain also — if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe.When there is such a \run,\ it is not clear where it stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk. Even the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations.Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward — and enormous collateral damage — in the rest of Europe.The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise; leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek \restructuring,\ because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain, Ireland and even Italy.The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down.Someone has to decide who should be defended and at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under pressurein the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely not hold together.There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would produce:- Talk down the euro — moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one.- As the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt.. Once the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e., prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic.• At that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through.• European banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive failure of euro groupthink — including most notably at the political level — but there is no question that bank executives have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse.To the extent possible, some of the ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a reason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.

C05766739	To rebuild Haiti, start with its young people A 700,000-strong national civic service corps would harness untapped labor rapidly and instill national pride and confidence. By Robert Muggah and Robert Maguire January 31, 2010 Haiti will need big ideas to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the devastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake this month. The reported death toll has topped 150,000, and the reconstruction needs are incalculable. How about starting with a 700,000-strong national civic service corps made up of Haitian youth? There are many reasons why such an entity makes a lot of sense. Haiti is a young country. An estimated 70% of the population is under 30; the 15-to-29 segment alone makes up 50% of the population. Demographers have long cautioned how excessively youthful populations can potentially exacerbate underdevelopment and accentuate political instability. Although Haiti registers among the lowest levels of education in the Western Hemisphere, Haitian youth are a wellspring of creativity, talent and potential. You don't need to be a community-development specialist to know that they are stifled by a lack of meaningful opportunities. Fortunately, Haiti has an enabling environment to set up a civic service corps. Article 52 of the Haitian Constitution commits citizens to national service, though it has never been activated. What is more, there are many Haitian and international organizations mobilized and ready to help the government get this going. A civic service corps would get the young and able out of the tent cities in and around Port-au-Prince and into work. They could start with the once-iconic center of the capital, but also could begin planting trees, working the fields and providing services in Haiti's countryside. At a minimum, this would reverse generations of unfair stigmatizing of the youth there. This plan would also harness untapped labor rapidly. Before the Jan. 12 earthquake, 50% of youth in their 20s were out of work. Putting them in service toward rebuilding the capital and outlying areas would be a first step to restoring their and their country's pride and dignity. A civic service corps would also multiply international efforts to promote recovery after the world moves on to the next crisis. Hundreds of humanitarian agencies, donor governments and nongovernmental organizations are facing monumental challenges in coordinating relief assistance. Although everyone involved is committed to rapid disbursement, transaction costs are monumental. A civic service corps would allow for a more rapid form of transferring capital. Direct support to such a corps would inject serious liquidity into the Haitian economy and stimulate recovery from the bottom up. Rather than food-for-work schemes, international best practice recommends proposals that promote direct monetary transfers to beneficiaries. Haitian youth and their families have urgent needs and don't need paternalistic programs that curb their choices. With proper oversight and financial safeguards, a civic service corps would circumvent unnecessary administrative costs. Further, a civic service corps would restore national pride and confidence in Haitian public institutions. During past decades, the state provided relatively few services to Haitians, particularly outside the capital. In some cases, state entities were downright predatory. As a result, nonstate providers, including gangs and shady middlemen, filled the gap. A civic service corps -- wearing the Haitian colors and acting as first responders or organizations demonstrating the government's presence on the ground -- would show that the government is serious about supporting citizens. It would be a symbolic first step toward renewing the social contract with the people. A civic service corps also makes sense for long-term risk and emergency planning. Haiti is situated in the path of hurricanes and on a fault line, and can expect more disasters. Training 700,000 young people -- especially young women -- in the basics of first aid, emergency response, community policing and other skills would greatly mitigate the consequences of future calamities. With disciplined training and management, the corps could provide more intensive training in specialized areas -- engineering, telecommunications and public health. An initial step to getting Haiti's youth to work could include the preparation of a road map for future meetings on Haiti, including the U.N. donor conference scheduled for March. Any final plan would need to draw on the invaluable experiences of ongoing efforts to mobilize youth in Haiti. These include the work of the Brazilian nongovernmental organization Viva Rio and its supporters. Before the earthquake, Viva Rio and Brazilian peacekeepers had recruited and trained hundreds of Haitian youth, including former gang members, to provide relief services in Haiti's slums. This program could be reactivated and scaled up quickly. A civic service corps could draw on the lessons from such groups to target and recruit youths for, say, up to two years. The Haitian government would, of course, need to be the one to manage the undertaking, with direct oversight from the president's office and the Interior Ministry. And there are many countries that could provide advice and support. Nongovernmental groups and private donors could also play a key role in mobilizing support and transferring essential skills. Haiti's youth are the future of the nation, and they are central to Haiti's recovery. A civic service corps is a large-scale way to quickly mobilize them to act as catalyst for long-term, progressive changes.

Mitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East Restore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values. Disturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has come to power, and the country's peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S. embassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all the while promising to annihilate Israel. These developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \bumps in the road.\ They are major issues that put our security at risk. Yet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We're not moving them in a direction that protects our people or our allies. And that's dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel's security is compromised, America could be pulled into the maelstrom. We still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East The first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We're unique in having earned that role not through conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through trade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none. But in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \recovery\ that barely deserves the name. Our national debt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House. Finally, our values have been misapplied—and misunderstood—by a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries. By failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability. He does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder. The Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented grave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few weeks The same incomprehension afflicts the president's policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \daylight\ between our two countries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \closest ally\ in the Middle East to being only \one of our closest allies.\ It's a diplomatic message that will be received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel's concerns about Iran as mere \noise\ that he prefers to \block out.\ And at a time when Israel needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East—that is, both governments and individuals who share our values. This means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability—and the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable, the ayatollahs must be made to believe us. It means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for those who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to extremism. But this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of our values. That will require a very different set of policies from those President Obama is pursuing.

SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS. NO FOIA WAIVER. The 20th century became an American Century because we were steadfast in defense of freedom. We made the painful sacrifices necessary to defeat totalitarianism In all of Its guises.. To defend ourselves and our allies, we paid the price in treasure and in soldiers who never came home. Our challenges are different now, but if the 21st century is to be another American Century, we need leaders who understand that keeping the peace requires American strength in all of its dimensions.

C05770232	Sen Mitchell proposes putting out the following statement tomorrow. We would respond on specific commitments on Ramat Shlomo if asked. Special Envoy Mitchell left the Middle East on Sunday, where he completed the first round of proximity talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The talks were serious and wide-ranging. Special Envoy Mitchell emphasized the importance of making progress in the proximity talks and of moving to direct negotiations as soon as possible. We have received commitments from both sides, and we have made assurances to both sides, that are enabling us to move forward. The full scope of these discussions will remain private. As both parties know, if either side takes significant actions during the proximity talks that we judge would seriously undermine trust, we will respond to hold them accountable and ensure that negotiations continue. Special Envoy Mitchell will return to the region next week to continue indirect negotiations with the parties.
